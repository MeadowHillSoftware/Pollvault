Hence his name, which means 'bearer' or 'endurer'. To complete the eleventh of his twelve labors, Heracles had to obtain the golden apples of the Hesperides, and he asked Atlas for help. Heracles offered to bear Atlas's burden in his absence, when he went to retrieve the apples. Atlas agreed to perform the task readily enough, since he did not plan on ever bearing that burden again. When Atlas returned with the apples, Heracles requested him to assume the load for a moment, saying he needed to adjust the pad to ease the pressure on his shoulders. After Atlas bore the heavens again, Heracles walked off with the golden apples.","Rating":6,"Awards":[]},"81":{"Name":"Aullail Woodslasher","Author":"Zurc Blackstar","Submitted":20021108,"Updated":20021109,"Category":"Human","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Gender":"Male","Abilities":"all abilities that monk fioghter allows","Skills":"all skill monk fighter allows","Alignment":"Neutral","Class1":"Monk / 01","Class2":"Fighter / 19","Level1":"01","Level2":"19","NPC":"No","HD / HP":"2460","Feats":"all feats","Type":"20","Description":"has improved weapons than zurc and bad streff fist, claws, and skin also has bs handaxe and bs bow and arrow","Rating":4,"Awards":[]},"82":{"Name":"Avatar Valheru","Author":"Silencer","Submitted":20020721,"Updated":20020721,"Category":"Human","Guild":"none","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Guild Rank":"n/a","Gender":"Male","Abilities":"32 Strength (unbuffed), 15 dexterity, 10 constitution, 13 intelligence, 8 wisdom, 10 charisma","Alignment":"Chaotic Good","Class1":"Fighter / 06","Level1":"06","Level2":"14","NPC":"No","HD / HP":"206","Feats":"Weapon proficiency (katana), weapon specilization (katana), improved criticals (katana), two-weapon fighting, ambidexterity, improved two-weapon fighting, improved parry, power attack, cleave, knockdown, improved knockdown.","Level3":"01","Type":"20","Description":"Let's just say when Aribeth attacked me, I instantly used knockdown on her and made her yield before she could even get up...","Rating":6,"Awards":[]},"83":{"Name":"Ayalia","Author":"Crazy-legs","Submitted":20040103,"Updated":20040103,"Category":"Elf","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Gender":"Female","Abilities":"Standard Wizard.","Skills":"Standard Wizard.","Class1":"Wizard / 20","Level1":"20","NPC":"No","HD / HP":"101","Feats":"Empower spell.

Some consider him to be a god of light since he was so bright, light shined from him. At one point Balder had a foreboding dream. Odin rode to Hel's realm to wake a volva from the dead to find out the meaning of Balder's dream. She foretold Balder's death by Hod (Hodur), his fraternal twin. Frigg asked all things to swear not to hurt Balder but didn't ask the mistletoe because it was so young. Loki, diguised as an old woman, visited Frigg and found out Balder was invunerable to everything but mistletoe. Loki then made a dart out of mistletoe and tricked the blind god Hod into throwing it at Balder -- all the other gods were playing games by throwing various items at Balder --, thus killing him.","Rating":6.5,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"86":{"Name":"Balor Lord","Author":"Andrei","Submitted":20020824,"Updated":20020824,"Category":"Other","Scripts Included?":"Yes","Dialog Included?":"Yes","Gender":"Male","Levels":"13","Class1":"Other / 13","Level1":"13","AC":"57","NPC":"No","HD / HP":"117","Type":"13","Description":"This is the Balor Lord, it has voices and everything, on problem, as it is level 13 it will level up, if you continue with same level without choosing one of the normal Classes the game will crash, I say don't level up at all, or just go for fighter.

Notes: I tried to roleplay his alignment (CN) as good as possible but most of the time he was partied/allied with good-doers fighting evil PCs. Like most sorcerers he suffers a bit from knowing only very few spells but I made him one annoying counterspell-mage (counterspell-mode quicksloted on F1 key). Whenever someone told him 'Don't go there - it's too dangerous!' he was found at that place a few minutes later, usually dead or - if he was lucky - running away from whatever was chasing him.

The lower Dex means you can wear heavier armor without waste, or you could improve it with the bracer or belt of agility.When using a good legit bow (like I've equipped him with in the character file), Child Prodigy can get about 45 damage, 135 on a critical, and averages about 270 damage per round using rapid shot.In brief, Child Prodigy takes better advantage of the game's legit equipment equipment. Even with 200 more hitpoints, he's not as tough as Reliable when naked, but equipped legit, he's probably one of the best Ranged builds out there. His Devastating Critical will not work until 1.63 comes out, at which point he will truly rock.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"167":{"Name":"Chris Lightfellow","Author":"Benjamin","Submitted":20040712,"Updated":20040712,"Category":"Human","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Gender":"Female","Class1":"Fighter / 18","Level1":"18","NPC":"No","Type":"18","Description":"Chris Lightfellow from Suikoden 3.

Honestly, it's a pain to travel with G., as she required repeated trips to the Temple of Tyr. However, her charm and love for animals made her one of the best of her field.

Expert in Heavy Flail(check out his customized \"Armaggedon\" main weapon). The looks and equipment have been modified to fit his personality (a huge boost over the old character in this domain). The character has not been hacked and it's legit. Portraits are included. I chose to let him at level 20 in order to allow some changes you would like to make, perhaps a different evolving path.\n\nNOTE: This character was created using CEP2 and will not show properly in the official campaigns or non CEP2 modules. IF you want to check it out quick, use the minimod included with CEP2. You can \nstill use the character in non CEP2 but with heavy loss in his personality (the elements from CEP2 only such as head, armor, helmet etc. will be invisible or replaced with something different). To use it in non CEP2 modules or OCs, CUSTOMIZE the character at the begining of the module/campaign changing his face appearance (otherwise it will be headless or with a white bag instead of a head...).

Most tales seem to involve a Red Mage of Thay, but most also usually involve a being of at least a quarter elven blood. What is known, is that where the Swifts go, there is usually a good tale to be told. Or so rumor says.\n\n\nHastian is neither the oldest, or the youngest of the Swift clan. He has however tended to be the oddest of the family. A fervent worshipper of Lliira, Hastian only lets his worship get ignored when he feels the need to sing. Or to dance. Or to flirt. He is quickly welcomed into the taverns and pubs he finds in his travels. He is also quickly ushered out once the daughters of all the town�s gentlemen start fawning too loudly. \n\nLately Hastian has been keeping his siblings tied down in the Heartlands, specifically around Shadowdale. Rumors tell that the Heartbreaker has had his own heart stolen by the famed Bard of Shadowdale. Rumors also hint that she doesn�t know he exists. \n\nHastian tends to be in the forefront of battle, being the only male to have come of age in the Swift clan. It is not that Chani is incapable of defending herself, or that Christiano can�t dodge the fastest blow, but some sense of chivalry forces Hastian to try and draw the enemy to his position first. This method does allow Chani plenty of time to pepper their enemies with arrows, and for Christiano to sneak behind their foes. \n\nThe Bard/Cleric I started up for the Siege of Shadowdale module.

What is known, is that where the Swifts go, there is usually a good tale to be told. Or so rumor says.\n\n\nChani is said to be eldest of the known Swift kin, but she has always remained tightlipped on the subject. Even tighter once she realizes that she has been said to be �old�. She shares little of Hastian�s vanity however, knowing that her companions in the wild think little of her beauty, extraordinary as it may be. Many a farm boy has held high hopes of wooing this maiden of Chauntea, but Chani has never been one to have dealings with humanoids other than when necessary. \n\nProtecting the farmlands of the Western Heartlands may not sound as glorious as some of the tales told of more well known rangers of Eldath or Silvanus, but Chani will fight to the death her defense of Chauntea�s bounty. She may not care much for human companionship, but she knows the crops she defends help many creatures. \n\nWhile adventuring with her siblings, Chani tends to take on a motherly role almost as foreign to her as her own mother was to her. Chani does not always know if she acts in the best manner when dealing with her younger siblings, but she believes Chauntea, Mother of All, has guided her hand. Sometimes guided it to a firm spanking when her brothers needed one. \n\nChani was the first character to join Hastian in his defense of Shadowdale in the Siege of Shadowdale mod. Ever since discovering the OHS companion system, I have not been able to look back. As such however, she has been leveled up almost entirely as a 'recommended' character, but I doubt that's such a bad thing. \n\nMy recommended Portrait Delainy (Bard) by gyrfalconthegray.

A boy of just fourteen, is it likely that Christiano should be spending some time in a schoolhouse, or at least looking for honest work on a farm or in a mill. Instead he is dragged along on countless (mis)adventures with his older siblings, often times getting them out of a jam as much as they do him. He does not like knowing how to crack a safe, or knowing the tell tale signs of a trapped corridor. But such knowledge comes to him unbidden. He would rather die than consider actually stealing from someone. Who didn�t deserve it. \n\nSeeming to care little for his own welfare, in battle Christiano tends to dart in and out of the fray, narrowly avoiding drow blades and his sister�s arrows. Some say Tymora must be smiling on him to have such luck. Sometimes, at night or while skulking about the Shadows, he sometimes worry it is not Tymora who has blessed him however. \n\nI had recently fallen in like with the name Christiano and contemplated using it for a rogue character with my Loviatan. I decided she needed a different companion though, so Christiano Swift was born. Originally I had decided the Link Boy following Hastian about was his younger brother who so graciously offered to carry a torch around the Underdark for him. Then I decided to make him an active participant. I had planned on using Leto to make him a human, but then change his avatar to the Teen, Human look. Then I just decided to make him a halfling, but change his subrace to 'Human'. So for all intents and purposes, he is a halfling, but for roleplaying purposes, he's just a human lad.

Lavoera06.bic is intended for my original purpose, using her as a companion for another character. As I should have imagined, her mace caused her fee to be astronimical (over 1 million gold) so this version does not include it. I've noticed her HP sometimes shows the old amount over 108ish, but sometimes it reverts. I am looking into that. Also, if used as a companion, and not a PC, she levels up in her Outsider class similar to HOTU. \n\nAfter listening to some comments, I have tried to balance her a bit more. As such, some notes. Her class being Outsider, while playing her as a PC she cannot level up in that particular class. So you'll have to choose a new one for her when she levels 9- (it defaults to Cleric). Also as such, she does not have anything other than some basic weapon proficiencies, and no armor feats. Furthermore, her stats have been lessened... a bit. I removed four points, the four she'd have received through normal leveling up to 18 (her HOTU level). But she still has 18+ for each of her stats. I'm pretty certsin I brought down her hit points, feats and skills to a more reasonable level. I left her with maybe a few more feats than she needed (Dodge, Weapon Focus mace, Power attack, and Uncanny Dodge 1), but lets consider those the feats she acquired for her first Outsider level. \n\nDoes include her mace from HOTU, which is (especially for her level) overkill. You might want to delete it or drop it if you'd like to remain legit. As legit as a Deva can be of course. I gave her a plain mace as well, so you don't have to start off too empty handed.

There is however, nothing but rumors about them. Their number is not even the wildest of rumors. Some tell of four children, some tell of sixty four. Some say there is a child for each day of the year. Some say, there is in fact only the three now, but there was once one more. Their origin is perhaps slightly less fabled however. Most tales seem to involve a Red Mage of Thay, but most also usually involve a being of at least a quarter elven blood. What is known, is that where the Swifts go, there is usually a good tale to be told. Or so rumor says.\n\nHastian is neither the oldest, or the youngest of the Swift clan. He has however tended to be the oddest of the family. A fervent worshipper of Lliira, Hastian only lets his worship get ignored when he feels the need to sing. Or to dance. Or to flirt. He is quickly welcomed into the taverns and pubs he finds in his travels. He is also quickly ushered out once the daughters of all the town�s gentlemen start fawning too loudly. \n\nLately Hastian has been keeping his siblings tied down in the Heartlands, specifically around Shadowdale. Rumors tell that the Heartbreaker has had his own heart stolen by the famed Bard of Shadowdale. Rumors also hint that she doesn�t know he exists. \n\nAfter helping the Sage of Shadowdale repel a Malaugrym invasion into that weary Dale, Hastian and his siblings headed West. Very West. Tales in their wake bespeak of a night of Drunken Honesty, wherein Hastian let the Bard of Shadowdale know of his (noble, no doubt) intentions. There is also rumor he is not allowed back into the Dale on pain of death. Several neighboring Dales have taken up that same proclamation, whether in imitation, or in caution, we might never know.\n\nThe next record of Hastian�s travels come to us from the war torn state of Tethyr. Hoping to find some bardic work (or clerical, when his bardic talents got him thrown out onto his ear), he signed himself and his siblings up for some mercenary work. The Sythillisian Empire had recently turned its sight on the beleaguered nation, and had sent out a call to arms. \n\nWhile serving with the mercenary forces, Hastian and his siblings rose to the forefront of heroes of the Alliance. Alongside a warrior named Eleana, and a power hungry mage by the name of Neremul, the group won many skirmishes against slavers, goblins and the undead. It was shortly after arriving at Suldanessellar that Hastian proved his heroics were not just serendipitous flukes when he saved the Queen, and helped destroy the Ogre Warlord of the army with just his small group of adventurers. \n\nUpon receiving recognition for his actions by the Queen of Tethyr and her King, Hastian had to battle treachery from the mercenaries whom he�d fought alongside of. During this tussle, Hastian became aware that Eleana had been a traitor to his cause all along. Heart crushed by the woman, who he had grown very fond of, he nonetheless chose to exonerate her to the Queen after slaying the traitorous mercenary captain (a battle the bard assures will become a great tale for the ages, young and old). \n\nIt was thus with a heavy heart that Hastian took his siblings from the land to find new adventure, and to perhaps heal his own wounds, while Tethyr tried to do the same. There is a standing bet on which will recover first.\n\nHastian tends to be in the forefront of battle, being the only male to have come of age in the Swift clan. It is not that Chani is incapable of defending herself, or that Christiano can�t dodge the fastest blow, but some sense of chivalry forces Hastian to try and draw the enemy to his position first. This method does allow Chani plenty of time to pepper their enemies with arrows, and for Christiano to sneak behind their foes. \n\nPortrait: male 2 by Vanwanoleion","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1038":{"Name":"Chani Swift (Tethyr)","Author":"Reluctantly Human","Submitted":20050911,"Updated":20050913,"Category":"Human","Gender":"Female","Skills":"All skills are listed before stat gain/loss.\n\nAnimal Empathy 12, Concentration 12, Heal 15, Hide 12, Listen 12, Lore 10, Move Silently 10, Persuade 3, Search 15, Spellcraft 5, Spot 15, Tumble 5","Size":"Medium","Alignment":"Neutral Good","Levels":"Ranger 9/Champion of Torm 3","Class1":"Ranger / 09","Class2":"Other / 03","Level1":"09","Level2":"03","AC":"35","Race":"Human","NPC":"No","Feats":"Animal Companion, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Blind Fight, Dual-Wield, Favored Enemy: Goblinoids, Favored Enemy: Orcs, Improved Critical (rapier), Improved Initiative, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Lay on Hands, Point Blank Shot, Quick to Master, Rapid Shot, Sacred Defense I, Shield Proficiency, Smite Evil, Trackless Step, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (longsword), Weapon Proficiency (marial), Weapon Proficiency (simple)","Description":"There are many rumors about the Swift clan of the Western Heartlands.

Some say there is a child for each day of the year. Some say, there is in fact only the three now, but there was once one more. Their origin is perhaps slightly less fabled however. Most tales seem to involve a Red Mage of Thay, but most also usually involve a being of at least a quarter elven blood. What is known, is that where the Swifts go, there is usually a good tale to be told. Or so rumor says.\n\nChani is said to be eldest of the known Swift kin, but she has always remained tightlipped on the subject. Even tighter once she realizes that she has been said to be �old�. She shares little of Hastian�s vanity however, knowing that her companions in the wild think little of her beauty, extraordinary as it may be. Many a farm boy has held high hopes of wooing this maiden of Chauntea, but Chani has never been one to have dealings with humanoids other than when necessary. \n\nProtecting the farmlands of the Western Heartlands may not sound as glorious as some of the tales told of more well known rangers of Eldath or Silvanus, but Chani will fight to the death her defense of Chauntea�s bounty. She may not care much for human companionship, but she knows the crops she defends help many creatures. \n\nWhile adventuring with her siblings, Chani tends to take on a motherly role almost as foreign to her as her own mother was to her. Chani does not always know if she acts in the best manner when dealing with her younger siblings, but she believes Chauntea, Mother of All, has guided her hand. Sometimes guided it to a firm spanking when her brothers needed one.\n\nThe war in Tethyr perhaps affected Chani most of all. That month spent either in the wilds of Darromar or on a tiring march to the Forest of Tethir, left her with little faith in the goodness of the creatures of the land. While many heroes presented themselves before her, their light was shadowed by all those around her with treacherous or malignant hearts. \n\nIn those trying times however, Chani somehow cracked the shell of a tightlipped mage of some renown that had joined the Tethyrian army. Callous and cool to all around him, somehow Neremul had become a constant companion at Chani�s side. Even his use of the �perversion� known as magic did little to sway Chani in her feelings, or her course. It was just as the army arrived in the Forest of Tethir, nearing the outskirts of Suldanessellar, that Chani decided she might be able to put aside her patron deity and be able to settle down with the magic wielder. And it was at this same time that he betrayed the army for a powerful necromantic artifact, leaving the ruined ranger in his wake. He never even looked back.\n\nEven after helping to slay the mighty warlord that was their enemy, Chani found herself in danger. Led to ruin in front of the Queen and her King of Tethyr, Chani took great pleasure in hunting down the duplicitous members of the Crimson Guard, and ultimately their leader Daramus. And when the girl she had helped nurse and train for the campaign, Eleana, too betrayed her, even if the girl had been mislead by Daramus, Chani felt little mercy for either of them. \n\nShe disappeared immediately following the rescuing of the monarchs. Leaving her brothers behind, this child of Chauntea has left to perhaps regain her faith. Or possibly slay all those who have left her in hurt.\nPortrait: Delainy (Bard) by gyrfalconthegray","Rating":9.75,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"1039":{"Name":"Mephistophles","Author":"YO","Submitted":20050918,"Updated":20050918,"Category":"Outsider","Gender":"Male","Size":"Medium","Race":"Other","Description":"this is the small version of Warf-12's mephitophels so you can actual fit though a door :D","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1042":{"Name":"Shani","Author":"Cale","Submitted":20050924,"Updated":20050924,"Category":"Human","Gender":"Female","Size":"Medium","Race":"Human","Description":"This is a female char I made.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1043":{"Name":"Detective Spy","Author":"Steve_Savicki","Submitted":20050924,"Updated":20060114,"Category":"Human","Gender":"Female","Size":"Medium","Alignment":"Lawful Good","Levels":"28 rogue/2 bard/10 Red Dragon Deciple.","Class1":"Rogue / 28","Class2":"Bard / 02","Class3":"Other / 10","Level1":"28","Level2":"02","Race":"Human","Level3":"10","Description":"This rogue knows whips can't be dual wielded (on-hand weapon only,) so she uses a shield in the other.

Her tale began - like many, amidst the lowly streets of Sigil many decades ago. The daughter of a lonely Tavern girl, who fell foul to the ravening lust of a Dragon in human form. Lashara as she was then known, was born to the screams and trials of the Thieves quarter and there, as the years rolled by she quickly grew to embrace its deadly dealings...\n\nGrowing to be both devious and cruel, Lashara soon developed a lust for betrayal and lasciviousness, due mainly to the way in which she was treated by others; stealing anything that wasn't nailed down, she found it easy to dupe the weak and the gullible with her beauty, charms and demeanour... But it wasn't until her late teens that she truly began to discover the hidden powers her fathers draconic blood had given her. Her skin began to develop a darker, more reddish hue to it, whilst her eyes began to burn with an inner savage fire; and these, coupled with her new found femininity she soon began to win for herself many admirers, especially amongst the weak willed and devious... \n\nUsing these tools she soon began work as a rather well paid and Escort and Courtesan to a local Merchant come Entrepreneur whose local skill as a Bard had also begun to peak her interest. With languid ease on Lashara's part the lurid Mastafar (as he was called) began to instruct her in the many Arts of the path, and to his chagrin and surprise he soon discovered that Lashara's skill would shortly, if given time and guidance would surely surpass his own. The fickle Mastafar, preferring to suffer no rival, decided then to end her life, rather than teach her further... It was to be the last mistake his petty old mind would ever make...\n\nSniffing out old Mastafar's treachery had come easily to Lashara, her keenly attuned sense for self preservation had quickly begun to manifest itself some years earlier, and on this occasion it was telling her that her masters' vapid inklings would surely manifest themselves with a fatal action against her. It was then that she decided to turn the spinning knife upon her wealthy mentor, and so, with the eyes and ears of a Dragon she deftly watched him from afar...\n\nShe realised that the attempt on her life would likely take place during their upcoming visit to the Realm of Kara-tur on Toril, a difficult to reach world known to many as the Forgotten Realms. They were to visit the province of Arakin in order to drop off a rare shipment of Hadralthian spices, and whilst there they were to meet a local Noble named Hashimatsu, who would in turn take delivery of the items for a mysterious buyer. When they arrived in Mi from the portal, Lashara wasted no time by immediately paying a local informant to run ahead in order to tell the noble lord that Mastafar had planned the intent to kill him by hiring a local talent for the job, a player known only as 'The Red Lotus...' Little did the lord know that Lashara was indeed the hired help, and that the assassin herself would indeed be Lashara..\n\nPaying good money over the next few days Lashara made efforts to pay out false leads and rumour in an attempt to isolate her self from any proposed wrongdoing. Mastafar it would seem would be the only name known to local low-life, and that the fictitious Red Lotus would remain their only suspect...\n\nLashara wasn't to realise that Hashimatsu - the noble lord, had many ways and means to obtain the light of secret knowledge. Agents of his were already in the village many days prior to his arrival, and that a consort (or Geisha) of his own clan was watching the site for any and all unusual movements. Hashimatsu had indeed scried ahead of the beautiful Lashara for many days now, and seeing that the young girl was indeed a woman after his own heart, he quietly arranged for the girls plan to go forward. Due to his scrying he quickly understood that Mastafar had been a cruel master, and that his dealings were often suspect, he arranged for his graceful spy - the Geisha to approach the evil Mastafar and with the skills brought forth by her clan she was ordered to lay low the filthy merchant...\n\nAnd there, that very night whilst the lovely Lashara slept, the deadly 'Red Lotus' struck...\n\nLashara awoke that morning to a strangely different world. Quietly getting dressed she made her way downstairs, only to discover the Inn in utter turmoil. It would seem that a foul and deadly murderer had struck the sleepy Inn during the night, and that the local constabulary were out in force trawling the town for suspects. As she looked Lashara could see that the common room itself was full of officious looking people, obviously there to cast some damning verdict on a scene completely out of their control. A local sheriff was taking stoic statements, whilst nearby an aging Wu'jen uttered the words of ancient spells in his efforts to scour the room for clues... Suddenly Lashara's will froze! Her panicked eyes locked forward towards a sight that seemed to make the whole common room spin and flail! A single tilted head; its blackened tongue now protruding from a face all bent with hate and rage lay staring across the room towards her - Mastafar...\n\n'Yahaaa!' Lashara cried! It was all the young Bard could do to stifle her panicked cries! Turning away, seemingly in revulsion, Lashara madly gripped the bar, and was suddenly hit by wave upon waves of joy, followed by immediate and uncontrollable urge to consume copious amounts of alcohol... Lashara began to realise that onlookers would soon see her stifled cries of merriment, and so, with a swiftness of action born of desperation she quickly fled the common room.\n\nLashara's thoughts began to run riot. She knew that Mastafars wealth 'and' death would likely bring debt. And that the debt would more than likely bring enemies; enemies that were more than able to collect it... Lashara suddenly realised that her own association with Mastafar would bring her trouble, and that the only way for her to escape it 'and' them was death...\n\nThinking dark thoughts, Lashara made her way back to her room... \n\n'How to escape the debtors?' she mused. 'Who was the Assassin?' and 'Why hadn't the killer slain her as well?'\n\nAll very strange, she thought. It had to be some kind of ronin thing, or some kind of blood debt stretching back to an earlier visit by Mastafar; I mean she was in Kara-tur after all, and whatever the slayers reasons were did little to help Lashara; she would clearly have to arrange a way out of this mess, and quickly! Sharply getting dressed Lashara made her way down and back to the madness of the common room. \n\n'The assassin has to be here...' she thought,\n\nAnd slowly, being careful not to attract any undue attention, Lashara slowly peaked the brim of her velvet hood and glanced around the common room; in a vaguest hope that her demon eyes would catch the lowly killer...\n\n'Blast it! Nothing...' she cursed. If the assassin or assassins were still here then they were bloody good, damn good; and realising that she was probably overstaying her welcome, Lashara left the frenzied Inn, her thoughts awash with frantic plans for survival...\n\nOver the past few days the streets of Mi had been strangely quiet, but today, and obviously because of the slaying, every soul in town was out; gossiping and trading, shouting and gawking. The murder it seemed was obviously the main topic of the day. And Lashara, taking up a cosy spot just across from the tavern's main entrance, began to form a cunning plan, as well as watch for new arrivals in their attempts to find the inn in town from the west. \n\nThe hours rolled by into late afternoon, when suddenly, there - just beyond the stables main gate, Lashara spied the perfect double... A young silver haired girl - perhaps in her late teens or early twenties; she was quickly helping her master to unhook a mouldy, creaky, old wagon.\n\n'She'll do...' Lashara whispered.\n\nHmm... She'd have to kill them all quickly she thought... Including the two men-at-arms along with them. The task itself would be easy. All she had to do was observe the young girls movements for a while in order to gleam her burly masters whereabouts. Later she would quickly stick the guards, or swiftly use her charms to fool them, and then in the dead of night she'd quickly kill their master by stealing the room's spare key from the barman. Then, it would be a simple matter to take the girl out with quick flick of a blade and bring her blooded limp remains to her own bedchamber. Once there, Lashara would quickly swap the girls clothes with her own and Voila! \nThe Courtesan of Mastafar would be no more!\n\nUnbeknownst to Lashara two Invisible blue eyes were watching her from only a few feet away. Both set within a perfect white face, and adorned with the reddest full lips the world had ever seen. Their graceful owner raised a faultless eyebrow and smiled. \n\n\"Hello my dear, no need to hide. The Master will see you now... Hmm\"\n\nAnd so, with the softest thud that only an angel could hear, Lashara, The Red Queen of Bards fell down to the floor, and began her walk to the stars...\n","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1067":{"Name":"Charismatic Survivalist","Author":"Steve_Savicki","Submitted":20051118,"Updated":20060111,"Category":"Human","Gender":"Male","Abilities":"Combined Divine Might from both Paladin and Blackguard classes\n\nGreat Smite X\n\nDivine Wrath from Torm Champ\n\nBoth Smite Good and Evil\n\nExtra Smiting\n\nImproved Power Attack","Alignment":"Lawful Good","Levels":"7 paladin/ 30 torm champ/ 3 blackguard","Class1":"Paladin / 07","Class2":"Other / 30","Class3":"Other / 03","Level1":"07","Level2":"30","Race":"Human","HD / HP":"430 HP","Level3":"03","Description":"This character was created on the base that fortitude is the matter of life and death.

(2nd edition known as DLC1-DLC3.) These 21 characters appear here in one or two versions - both in module (.erf) form and PC (.bic) form - for use by DMs or Players. The .bics come in 201 versions and the NPCs in 33 versions. All 21 come with the magic items they start out at, as well as 1,000 gold for buying supplies. The .bics come with 1st level versions - with or without experience - so players may start out from the beginning, or just to get their own feats and skills chosen instead of those pre-picked for them. They also come with unadjusted attributes and DM-modified attributes (to match module stats). Unadjusted characters get unsellable magic items to alter their attributes.\n\nThe .bics come in three versions: Heroes of Krynn.exe, DLC Individuals, and DLC Vaults. The Heroes of Krynn.exe has a NWN module, a HOTU module, a NWN .erf, a HOTU .erf, the DLC_NWN_CHAR.txt, this Heroes of Krynn.txt read me, 9 character journals, and 44 .bics. Thirty-five of these .bics are as close to replicas of the characters listed in modules DLC1-DLC3 as I can get. The DLC Individuals has all the .bics for each player in their own zip file. The DLC Vaults has the .bics divided into DLC1, DLC2, DLC3, and DM Client. It is recommended you only use these if you are making your own modules, or playing those outside DLC1-DLC3.\n\nNOTE: Only the nine 1st level .bics will function in modules unless you have unmarked the Enforce Legal Characters box. This can be found by going multi-player, pressing load, and using advanced options from the load screen. If you don't wish to do this use the legal characters in DLC Individuals or DLC Vaults. They come with or without magical adjustment.\n\nThe Heroes of Krynn.exe includes two .erfs for DMs. The HOTU .erf is different than the NWN .erf in only a few ways. Several wizards have different cantrips memorized due to added game spells. The Hammer of Kharas, Riverwind's Flute and the Flute of Wind Dancing have HOTU spells added to their properties. Both .erfs use the exact same resrefs. The NWN and HOTU modules are for spending the 1,000 gold a PC starts out with, and to examine the 100+ blueprints for weapons, armor and magic items made for the characters. All are available for viewing, though only a DM may open the crates with plot items from DLC1, DLC2 and DLC3. All 33 npcs are also available to admire and add to a party. Only one for NWN, only two for HOTU.\n\nThere are several text files available for reading. The DragonLanceChronicles1to3.doc contains the descriptions of all NPCs as taken from DLC1 - DLC3. DL Module Descriptions are the descriptions from the covers of DL1 - DL4, DL6 - DL10, and DL12 - DL12. DLC ERFs lists the details of all NPCs and magic items in the .erfs, for use by players and DMs alike. Dragonlance Character Files lists all 201 .bics and the attributes each has. And this read me file.\n\nHave fun playing the characters. Or setting them up for others to play.\n\nP.S.: Some of the .bics won't be usable even with legal characters because the items they start with require higher levels to play than they are. Goldmoon's Blue Crystal Staff requires an 18th level character, Goldmoon is 5th. This is replaced by a Staff of Striking and Curing at 8h level which requires a 12th level user. The Hammer of Kharas requires 22nd or 23rd level, the Silver Arm of Ergoth 21st level, Raistlin's Staff of the Magius 14th level (he is level 6 max), etc. To use these items you must unmark the Item Levels Restriction Box. See the note on Enforce Legal Characters above.\n\nHEROES_OF_KRYNN.EXE NOW HAS CLOAKS. All 44 .bics, all 33 NPCs and two cabinets now have 1.68 cloaks in different shapes and colors for the characters of the adventures. (Actually Raistlin and Fizban wear robes not cloaks, so it is 40 and 31 respectively.) Characters not from the .exe need to enter the HOK module, transition north of Fizban, head into the east room, and look through the appropriate cabinet to get colored cloaks. Each is named after the character except the Solamnia Cloaks which are for Sturm Brightblade, Derek Crownguard and Lord Gunthar uth Wistan. These 201 .bics will be updated in the next week or two.","Rating":9.42,"Votes":31,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"1212":{"Name":"Celena's Head","Author":"FireflydragonM","Submitted":20060614,"Updated":20060615,"Category":"ALL","Gender":"Female","Race":"Halfling","Description":"This is the head that needs to be placed in the override folder to see Celena's head on the Castlevania server. \n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1213":{"Name":"Siege God of Chaos","Author":"Rikki","Submitted":20060621,"Updated":20060622,"Category":"ALL","Gender":"Male","Description":"The God of Chaos offers up his powerful Avatar to you.

This is Hannibal in his prime, around 35 years old and at his nastiest. According to a D&D Pencil and Paper game discussion, about Hannibal... \"Hannibal Lecter, is intimidation incarnate... (and applied psychology, in general). In D&D terms, I'd expect him to have a mean charisma and max ranks in intimidate, possibly with some synergy... and a skill focus. Any strength he might possess (I recall him as, of course, being stronger than \nClarice... but not all that bulky) is enhancing this at best. He has uncanny perception, inhuman hearing, and more commonly noticed, an animalistic sense of smell. He is also a fairly capable swordsman.\" Pretty fair estimate, hmmm?\n\nHannibal's Appearance (compare to the screen shot, it's pretty much spot-on):\nThe novels have him with black hair and a widow's peak, almost like the classic interpretation of Dracula... as opposed to Anthony Hopkins' portrayal... so, I kept with the novels' interpretation as they were, of course, the original and also best source for info on Hannibal!\nHis soundset is... what else? The Nwn sociopath one; it sounds just like him.\n\nHannibal's Levels and various skills:\nFirst of all, he is Lawful Evil, since he enjoys art and society, and performs his infamous deeds from within society, more in control of situations than not.\nI made him to level 40, since he's had years to hone all his murderous skills,\nand I've divided his levels between two classes: Rogue (lvl 28) to reflect his criminal history, and Assassin (lvl 12) because this guy enjoys his killing. I gave him high points in healing, since he was described as a medical genius, and I gave him even higher points in any and all skills which would involve manipulating people (like intimidation, persuade, etc.). Vital skills such as spot, listen, and search, I gave high points to as well. Most of the *major* skill points of interest are in the 30s or 40s. He's not the type to just pick pockets, open locks, or disarm things, but he can set some deadly traps, go about almost unseen, and deal bloody death. I did not use Leto at all, since I wanted to make his level progression realistic instead of forced... so I've used a level-up module instead. Since I did it this way, the character will be fully legal in-game and also not *too* over-the-top. Here, are his statistics (I couldn't raise them further without Leto, so they are more than fair)...\n\nHannibal's Stats (without their being modified by his items):\nStr: 15 / Dex: 16 / Con: 14 / Int: 15 / Wis: 9 / Cha: 16 / HP: 289\n\nHannibal's Items:\nWith all his items equipped, his Str becomes 18... and his Wis becomes 12.\nThe items he comes with are all mostly custom, including blood he can drink\nto heal himself like a healing potion, and flesh he can eat that causes him to regenerate (closest thing to making a Nwn human cannibal totally \"realistic\" that I could think of without using any scripting). For armor it was difficult, since Nwn isn't modern so I've made a fancy dress suit for him, that looked *modern enough* without it being out of place too much in Nwn; I also made him a \"Prison Uniform\" in case you want him to be from around the time he escaped his incarceration. The suit is +3, the equivalent to a regular suit of the +3 leather armor, and the Prison getup is just clothes. His weapons rangle from a surgical scapel (Dagger +1, Keen), to the grisly tools of his vengeance as shown in \"Hannibal Rising\" (assorted wicked +3 stuff). Besides all of that, I gave him a ring that boosts his base strength and a belt that does the same for his wisdom. Those are not anyhing ever mentioned in the novels or films\nbut I tied them into the storyline in various ways (examine them if you are curious). Several other items (even a cookbook) are also included with him.(Just for fun I've made the ring so it enables Blood Frenzy but once per day!)\n\nThat pretty much wraps up my very first Character submission for the Nwn Vault. \nHannibal Lecter: He may not be entirely super-uber... but he sure is a killer!","Rating":6.88,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"1297":{"Name":"The Kurgan","Author":"Chaos_Theocrat","Submitted":20070124,"Updated":20070124,"Category":"Human","Gender":"Male","Size":"Medium","Race":"Human","Description":"** Requires Nwn 1.68 **\n\nFew Highlander fans could argue that the best villain in all the movies was the Kurgan. Whether you remember him for having the nastiest sword and armor in the film... or perhaps his demonic sounding voice saying the classic line: \n\"It's better to burn out, than to fade away!\" he was one villain, who knew how to steal (as well as demolish) a scene. Long ago, someone here on the Vault had said it all, appropriately calling the Kurgan \"The Ultimate Blackguard\". And at last, here he is: The Kurgan himself as a playable character for Neverwinter Nights! Finally, you can play as this epitome of Medieval evil, and show your enemies the power of one BAD Immortal. \n(A Minor Note... Leto was not used, in the creation of this character for Nwn.)\n\nThe Kurgan's Age and Appearance:\nI made him 2990, his age by the time of the first Highlander movie. His entire appearance I made as close to the film as is possible with Nwn. I chose Power Hungry for his sounset; it was, by far, the closest of them all to his voice. \n\nThe Kurgan's Alignment and Levels: Chaotic Evil, Level 10 Fighter / Level 30 Blackguard / Level 40 Total\n\nThe Kurgan's Stats: \nStr: 20 / Dex: 10 / Con: 19 / Int: 14 / Wis: 10 / Cha: 16 / HP: 559\n\nThe Kurgan's Immortality:\nTo simulate him being an Immortal, I gave him an \"Amulet of Immortality\",\nwhich is plot and undroppable, and it grants the wearer immunity in all of these areas...100% Immunity to Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Divine, Electrical, Fire, Magical, Negative Energy, also Piercing, Positive Energy, and Sonic, as well as Miscellaneous Immunity to Death Magic, Disease, and Poison. The only damage type that can kill him is Slashing. (So he can \"lose his head\"!) He is still fully able to be affected by Critical Hits, Sneak Attacks, Fear, Knockdown, Draining, Spells that don't cause any magical damage (Spells such as Mind-Affecting for example)... and lastly: Paralysis. Without the Amulet equipped, the Kurgan also has a natural resistance to both Disease and Poison, as well as a host of other abilities.\nAlso, to simulate the Immortal ability to rapidly heal wounds, I have added \nto the Amulet the identical ability of a standard ring of regeneration. So, to play him as a Mortal: just unequip the Amulet, and you are ready to rumble.\n\nThe Kurgan's Items:\nHe has the armor he wore when he first encountered Connor Macleod, it's a set of +3 Kurgan Armor, and his weapon of choice is his powerful +3 Claymore. All these plus the Amulet of Immortality, along with his abilities, levels, and skills, add up to make him one of the most powerful Blackguards in any world\nor time. He also comes with some other useful starting items of the standard variety. (Like a torch, potions, etc.)\n\nThey don't come much more powerful than the Kurgan, so if you've always wanted to walk the many worlds of Nwn in his boots, now is the time to download him!","Rating":9.92,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"1299":{"Name":"Noober Dick the perfect Level20 Human Wiz","Author":"AnthroPlayer [aka Vinchenzo the jackal]","Submitted":20070131,"Updated":20070131,"Category":"Human","Guild":"what?","Attacks":"punch (-1 to 3 DMG)\nwizard weapon pro\nall wizard spells\nall metamagic feats","Damage":"0-200+ (must use right spell)","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Guild Rank":"uh, what?","Gender":"Male","Abilities":"STR=8\nDEX=8\nCON=10\nINT=over 22\nWIS=forgot\nCHR=same as WIS, which is higher than STR & DEX but lower than INT","Initiative":"Low.........","Skills":"all skill points spent on class skills and set traps.","Size":"Medium","Alignment":"Neutral Good","Levels":"wizard level 1-20\nall ability points spent on INT.\n","Class1":"Wizard / 20","Class2":"Wizard / 20","Properties":"is really young","Class3":"Wizard / 20","Challenge Rating":"Various","Level1":"20","Level2":"20","AC":"oh! thats easy, pathetic.","Race":"Human","NPC":"No","HD / HP":"exactly 100 natural","Feats":"you'll see, you'll all SEE!!!","Level3":"20","Forums":"I make one for my stuff someday","Description":"This is a level 20 legit wizard I made.\nWhile his equipment is pretty crappy, you should take note at how his HP is maxed at each level (took a while of cancel levelup cancel levelup) and his excellent choice of spellcasting feats and full [thats right, full] wizard spellbook.\n\nThis character is very good for Role-playing but if desired he can be made into a PVP ass-kicker by using the automatic metamagic feat (which makes all spells be any of the meta-magic of your choosing while leveling, requires a epic class and level character).\n\nI would enjoy feedback, and yes, I realized a glitch in-game removed the CEP head and replaced it with a permanent Helm head, even for non-CEP places...","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1300":{"Name":"Shadow Jenkins - Smuggler","Author":"freelancer sunny","Submitted":20070204,"Updated":20070204,"Category":"Human","Guild":"nay i say","Attacks":"sneaky ones","Damage":"not much","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Guild Rank":"nay i say","Gender":"Male","Abilities":"find out yourself","Initiative":"find out yourself","Skills":"find out yourself","Size":"Medium","Alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","Levels":"find out yourself","Class1":"Rogue / 20","Class2":"Other / 20","Properties":"find out yourself","Level1":"20","Level2":"20","AC":"find out yourself","Race":"Human","NPC":"No","HD / HP":"find out yourself","Feats":"find out yourself","Forums":"Characters","Description":"Shadow Jenkins is a smuggler.

Kind and benevolent, she offers aid to weary travelers where she can, most often in the form of wisdom, warning, or healing. She also seeks to preserve wildlife from wanton destruction.\n\nKaldt is in tune with the natural lands, embracing the frigid clime. She understands that it is a harsh, brutal region in which to live. She does not interfere with nature taking it�s course, whether it is an orc tribe hunting elk or a fox hunting a hare. She does however strive to prevent suffering.\n\nAlignment: Good\nCommon followers: Druids and nature clerics. Some barbarians.\nAppearance: Kaldt is a beautiful female, human in appearance. Her skin and complexion reflect the clime, she is the color of ice and snow, with a tinge of blue. She typically carries a staff.\n\nA mother sits at dusk near a pond, watching her children frolic about the snow, playing with the family pet, a husky. She thinks about dinner for the evening, and how she will have little to provide them with. It has been hard since their father left them. She is amazed that her son has grown to the size he has, he is nearly a man at age 15. Her daughter rides on the back of the dog, giggling and laughing. She is just about to suggest heading home for the evening when the dog stops, dropping the 7 year old girl in a puff of snow.\n\nA low growl emanates from the husky as a pair of dark shapes appear from a nearby treeline. Low slung, yet larger than the family dog, wolves. The husky immediately places itself between the three and the threat. But soon it is forced to make a choice, as the wolves split and encirlce the group. It chooses the larger of the two, and streaks forward.\n\nBranwen knows that she must get her family out. The bitch shoots in at her son, and she is forced to choose. Stay by her daughter�s side or help her son. In the time it takes for her to decide, her son lays in a circle of crimson snow. The female wolf slowly pushes her and Lexi back. She keeps her daughter behind her as she retreats, always facing the wolf. Just as Lexi is about to say something, the wolf lunges into them, blindingly fast, and knocks both of them into the pond, the ice breaking and cutting her as the three are engulfed. The wolf bites into her arm, she feels Lexi clawing up her back, her lungs burn.\n\nThen a moment of clarity settles over her. She ceases to struggle, instead using the wolf�s embrace as a point of reference. She grabs Lexi by the coat roughly, and shoves her towards the shore. In her struggle her head breaks the surface. She sees Lexi clinging to an ice floe, and beyond that the male wolf limping back into the wood. The husky lies steaming 40 yards away. The weight of the female pulls her below the surface, and in the middle of all this horror, Branwen finds solace. Then she finds darkness.\n\nNearby a woman watches motionless, tears in her eyes. She watches as the young girl claws her way to the shore, and collapses weeping, looking at the surface of the pond. She loses consciousness soon after. The woman watches on as darkness conquers the region. Kaldt and Lexi are the only ones to bear witness to the bravery of a mother and the bravery of family. She will make sure this child is not lost. While it is often impossible to interfere directly, she will not see this girl lost.\n\nWhen Lexi awakens in the morning, she is covered in warm blankets. She manages to walk home, alone. Her story is oft told on cold winter nights, and becomes reknowned through the region. In time she has her own family. And not once does she fail to uphold her mother�s memory, not once does her own well being come before the well being of those she loves. Over the years, Kaldt looks in on her, and each time she smiles. She knows that while much was lost, not all was. The strength of family and the selflessness that is often found in it lives on with Lexi and others. And at this Kaldt smiles.","Rating":3.25,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"1424":{"Name":"Shaun","Author":"The Amethyst Dragon","Submitted":20100626,"Updated":20100626,"Category":"Undead","Gender":"Male","Race":"Human","Forums":"Link","Description":"Back at the end of March, BeyondThePale posted an interesting article on creating NPCs as concepts that could be roleplayed by a DM, rather than just a set creature file with certain stats. This is a character designed along those lines.\n\nNo .erf file, just a background and personality.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nBorn into a wealthy merchant family in a large city, Shaun was a curious child that spent countless hours quietly observing the world around him. He studied ants as they paraded through his family's gardens, watched with fascination while caterpillars munched on leaves, observed ice crystals spread across puddles when winter set in, and even spent days sketching out the facial expressions of street vendors hawking their wares to complete strangers.\n\nAs he grew up, it was only natural that he be apprenticed to the most learned wizard in the city. Shaun spent the first year just watching his new master, noting everything from the weave of the wizard's robes to the smallest changes in inflections during spellcasting incantations. As he started to cast minor spells himself, Shaun took copious notes on every small variation made in even the simplest cantrips.\n\nDuring his third year of apprenticeship, Shaun's tendency to focus obsessively on a subject (and sometimes ignoring other things around him) led to his being caught accidentally in a magical ritual involving necromatic negative energies. Wracked with pain from the magic, Shaun managed to crawl into his bed and passed out, waking a week later.\n\nWhen he awoke, Shaun discovered he had changed. Gone was any sense of pain. Gone was the need for sleep. Gone was his heartbeat. Shaun had awoken as a zombie!\n\nSomething in the magical ritual had transformed the fledgling wizard and infinitely curious young man into an infinitely curious undead wizard.\n\nShaun's current obsessive observations are focused on his own continually rotting form. He spends his days watching the flesh putrify and drop off, only to regrow and repeat the process. He has observed several generations of flies in their development on his skin. He has even gone so far as to take notes on the changing flavors of his own flesh during the different stages of decay. And Shaun is more than willing to share his observations (and maybe a taste of his arm) with anyone that will approach him.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nYes, this NPC was inspired by the title of the comedic movie Shaun of the Dead.","Rating":9.75,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"1427":{"Name":"Serenity Frost","Author":"Serenity Frost","Submitted":20100805,"Updated":20100811,"Category":"Wild Elves","Guild":"sharwyn","Attacks":"None","Damage":"None","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Guild Rank":"evil","Gender":"Female","Abilities":"none","Initiative":"none","Skills":"None","Size":"Huge","Alignment":"Lawful Evil","Levels":"20/30/40","Class1":"Bard / 20","Class2":"Cleric / 30","Properties":"none","Class3":"Sorcerer / 40","Challenge Rating":"20","Level1":"20","Level2":"30","AC":"none","Race":"Half-Elf","NPC":"No","HD / HP":"300","Feats":"none","Level3":"40","Forums":"sharwyn","Description":"None","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1428":{"Name":"Cammy White - Beta","Author":"Artine","Submitted":20100807,"Updated":20100807,"Category":"Human","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Gender":"Female","Alignment":"Neutral","Class1":"Fighter / 01","Level1":"01","Race":"Human","NPC":"No","Description":"Cammy White from the Street Fighter games.
