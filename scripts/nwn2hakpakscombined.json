It replaces the Cloth, Chain, Leather and Plate Armor Textures, all of those with untintable areas (Which would always be light-brown or gray) they are now Color #2 or Color #3.\n\nPreviously some areas could not be tinted because they had no tint-mapping on those areas.\n\nSome prime examples are the \"Hair of Ilmater Armor\", another is the Arcane Armor Armor, the tabard was previously yellow and unchangeably so, well now it can be changed. The WHite star armor's shoulders were untintable-grey and for some reason the stars were also included in color 3, well now they are white.\n\nAlso, now things like the Monk's Sash are tintable which would always be brown before.\n\nAlso, in the case of global (default) items' untintable areas, those areas will now be whichever color was not adjacent to the untitnable section of that item.\n\nThis will automaticially work in the Official Campaign, any user created modules and online.\n\nThis works for Humans, Halflings, Elves, Planetouched Males and Females.\nNo support for Half-Orcs, Gnomes or Dwarves.

Be sure to vote on the developers page so they keep up the great work!\n\nI have changed the structure of the hak. I have decided to split out the 2da files into a seperate hak and split the hak into two pieces for ease of use. \n\nThis is a comblined hak of the awesome custom content that I use for the PW for Waterdeep, Underdark and Skullport. I figured since it was such a hassle to get this thing together that I would share. \n\nPlayers: \nDownload the Skullhak_2_a_v24.rar (Haks are extracted and placed in the my documents\\nwn2\\haks directory)\nDownload the Skullhak_2_b_v24.rar (Haks are extracted and placed in the my documents\\nwn2\\haks directory)\nDownload the Skullhak_2_2da_v24.rar (Haks are extracted and placed in the my documents\\nwn2\\haks directory)\n\nDevelopers(Builders): \n1.

If you have not imported the erf, yet while the module is open click File|Import find the erf and import it.\n\n\nI had to re-assign many of the placeables differnt numbers in the 2das because the hak builders overlapped much of their content. Since the Itemplacesables was the largest (and I'm lazy) that is the primary one that I did not move)\n\nIf you already use one of the original creator placeable haks, be careful when trying to use this one. You may have to replace the existing placeable within your module. I have provided an erf to add these models with the appearance locations that I changed them to, but again if the placeable is alrady placed in your mod then using this may change the appearance. You can manually change it back or replace the placeable from the one imported.\n\n\n\nHere is the list of contents.

Save the module, and restart.\n\nFor players of modules that already use this pack... you will only need to put the Hak Pak into the hak folder.\nInstalling the blueprints will not be necessary unless you are a builder. If you are a builder, then read on below:\n\nTo add the blueprints, place the whole contents of the Blueprints folder into your override folder. I opted to use this method in place of using an .erf because in Nwn2, .erf blueprints that have a lot of placeables in them take longer to save in the toolset than the override blueprints do. This version of Chaos Placeables is now easier to set up and build with than it ever was before! So, v1.8 is now the version of choice for players and builders alike.\n\nNote: only two .2da files are used in this pack - placeables, and doortypes.\nNaturally... the blueprints will only work with the Hak Pak installed, so do not try to use them without the hak file. All the future versions of this compilation will continue to use this format, so no further format changes will be necessary to implement. :)\n\nHere is a list of what you'll get in Chaos Placeables for Nwn2... with the names of the individuals who made the placeables:\n\n25 Paintings By Thomas_B\n\nAnimated Catapult By ArPharazon\n\nBig Tower By Botumys\n\nBTH House Placeables\nBy Barry The Hatchet\n\nBTH Rune Placeables\nBy Barry The Hatchet\n\nBTH Rural Defence Pack\nBy Barry The Hatchet\n\nBTH Standing Stone Placeables\nBy Barry The Hatchet\n\nBuilding Construction Kit By Nytir\n\nBuilding Construction Kit (Oriental)\nBy Nytir\n\nBuilding Construction Kit 2 By Nytir\n(Generic, Gothic, and Classical)\n\nCave Roof By ArPharazon\n\nCity HAK By Tupoun\n(New and Missing Buildings added)\n(New Buildings and Missing Textures added, as of Sunday, March 02, 2008)\n(Fountains, Bridges, etc. added in 1.7)\n(22.03.2008 Update Content for 1.8)\n\nCity Walls 1.0 By Simbolic\n\nCliff Pack By Trevor Morris\n\nFaerun Stain Glass By Arpharazon\n\nFusuma Doors v1.0 By Kurogo\n\nHeed's Boardable Ships By Heed\n\nJapanese House Placeables v1.0\nBy Kurogo (Docs Included)\n\nRBRuins By Racerblue\n\nRWS Bridge Pack By RWS\n\nRWS Cave Entrances By RWS\n\nRWS Towers By RWS\n\nSDJ Oriental Placeables Pack 1 By SDJ\n\nSDJ Oriental Placeables Pack 2 By SDJ\n\nSimple wooden Signposts\nBy Crystal Violet\n\n*More* Simple wooden Signposts\nBy Crystal Violet\n\nStain Glass By Ar_Pharazon\n\nZpirit's Boulders By Zpirit\n\nZpirit's Crystal Pack By Zpirit\n\nZpirit's Mushroom Pack By Zpirit\n\nNote: All the missing textures for the castles in the City HAK By Tupoun have been restored.

Your module-specific haks can now be much smaller, and focus on module-specific changes instead of having to also worry about merging all the nice vault models together.\n\nThis package's goal is also to further recognize and reward the artists' work by putting their creations in a widely useable format, showcasing their talent to more builders and as a consequence to more players.\n\nthe 3C initiative is intended as a COMMUNITY project. To send an update or an improvement of any kind, either post about it below or email me or MokahTGS.\n\n\nWhat 3C is NOT about\n3C is not the CEP. It's more specialized. Unlike the CEP (Community Expansion Pack) for NWN1, 3C specializes on base models, content, and only the 2DA files to make it work. No fluff. For your convenience, it does not (and will never) contain any scripts, TLKs, GUIs and the like. Those files are the sole domain of specialized ruleset haks and of whoever builds their own module.\n\n\nWho made 3C?\nFirst of all, the authors of all the content provided both in this pack and on the vault (list available below). \nTheir work was compiled by MokahTGS and Thunderblade_33 and, in the case of the music compilation, by Dragonsbane777.\n\n\nCredits and Content Breakdown\nClick Here.\n\n\nThe Haks\n\n* 3C_core_areas.hak\nTilesets, doors, terrain and grass.\n\n* 3C_core_armors.hak\nBody armor, clothes, hats, cloaks, boots, gloves and belts. All race/gender supported releases only.\n\n* 3C_core_creatures.hak\nCreatures of all kinds. \n\n* 3C_core_pcparts.hak\nWings, tails, faces, hairstyles and the like for Player Characters\n\n* 3C_core_items.hak\nweapons, shields, holdables and item icons.\n\n* 3C_core_placeables.hak\nPlaceables. The gargantuan lot of them.\n\n* 3C_core_vfx.hak\nVFX files compilation.\n\n\nHow to Download and Install\n\nTo unpack 7z archives (and pretty much every known compressed file type), use the completely free program 7-zip, available at Link\n\nPlayers: download and place the latest version of the 3C haks in your My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/hak folder. If you want to use the haks in your module without further changes, also grab the 2da hak from the \"toolset files\" download. That's all.\n\nBuilders: In addition to the above, you will need to place the loose 2das in your override, add the toolset icons to your toolset folder (instructions provided) and add the blueprints erf to your module.\n\nHaks are compatible with all versions. 2DAs are MotB's, so you will be able to use them but will see MotB + 3C entries in the NWN2 toolset.\n\nFor further help with installation, first see this article by Heed about installing custom content in NWN2: Link\n\n\n\nExtra Content Packages\nLook over there for affiliated 3C packages.

Sorry about that.\nPrevious Update, 1.4.0 : \n - Includes Kaedrin & Reeron's v1.20, and TonyK's latest ai mod\n - Added Extra Invocation feat for warlocks lv6 and up, and Epic Extra Invocation feat for warlocks lv16 (who are atleast 21 total levels, /w 24 spellcraft)\n - Fixed Flee the Scene & Voidsense, for real this time. That decoy will behave like it should now.\n - Fixed some typos in the dialog.tlk\n - Rewrote Warlock Buddy & simplified it into fewer buttons.\nPlanned Updates :\n - Some of the following Epic Warlock Feats: Dark Transient, Master of the Elements, Morpheme Savant, Paragon Visionary, Shadowmaster, Verminlord, Plague Bearer, Eldritch Sculptor, & Lord of all Essences.\n---------------------------------------\nKnown bugs\n1) Ultravision doesn't actually do what it's supposed to. Not my fault, 'tis Obsidian's.\n2) You cannot obtain (usable) essences, or shapes with Extra Invocation.\n3) The ai is a little confused about what to do with some of the invocations, so for now it doesn't do anything with several of them.\n\n---------------------------------------\nHellfire Warlock prestige class statistics:\n\nRequirements:\n\nClass: Warlock Level 6 or higher\n\nSkills: Lore 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks, Intimidate 6 ranks\n\nClass Features:\n\n- Hit Die: d6\n\n- Base Attack Bonus: Medium.\n\n- High Saves: Will.\n\n- Weapon Proficiencies: Simple weapons.\n\n- Armor Proficiencies: Light armor. A warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure.\n\n- Skill Points: 2 + Int modifier per level.\n\n- Class Skills: Bluff, Concentration, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Lore, Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device.\n\n- Eldritch Blast: At each even-numbered Hellfire Warlock level, your Eldritch Blast damage increases by 1d6.\n\n- Invoking: At each level, you gain new invocations known as if you had also gained a level in the warlock class.\n\n- Hellfire Blast: Whenever you use the hellfire blast ability, your next shaped eldritch blast becomes a hellfire blast. A hellfire blast deals your normal eldritch blast damage plus an extra 1d6 points of divine damage per Hellfire Warlock class level. If your blast hits multiple targets (for example, the eldritch chain or eldritch cone blast shape invocations), each target takes the extra damage. This ability can't be used with the Hideous Blow shape, however.\n\n- Hellfire Shield: Starting at 2rd level, you can call up hellfire to surround yourself with a protective barrier. Whenever someone directs a melee attack against you, a small blast of hellfire is immediately aimed and fired at that creature. This blast deals damage equal to your CON modifier + 2d6 additional hellfire damage. Every other Hellfire Warlock level, the [2d6] dice increase in size (ie, 2d8 at level 6, then 2d10 at level 8, up to 2d12 at level 10).\n\n- Infernal Resistance: At 2nd level, you gain resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with any resistance to fire you have gained from warlock class levels.\n\n- Hellfire Infusion: At 6th level, you gain the ability to infuse your own body with Hellfire, thus granting you strength enhancement and 2d6 hellfire damage to all your melee and touch attacks. However you will also suffer tremendous burning and pain from the Hellfire flowing through you. The effect of this ability is permanent, to deactivate the effect you must use the ability again while infused.\n\n- Hellfire Doom: At 9th level, you can perform a melee touch attack on a single opponent to infuse their body with seering Hellfire, causing them to take the damage of a Hellfire Blast (minus the Eldritch Blast) every round. The effect lasts for 3 rounds + 1 per CON modifier, and the victim can make a Fort save (DC : 19 + Con Modifier) each round to half the remaining damage. The halving effects of a successful save will stack with each successful save thereafter as well. The damage dealt per round cannot go below 1d6.\n\n- Infernal Sustinence: At 10th level, your experience and failures have taught you much. Because of this, your resilience has improved and you gain a permanent 4 point increase to your Constitution score. This increase is natural and will stack with bonuses from spells or equipment. (Note! This will award you with the first four epic great constitution feats, so do not take those feats prior to obtaining lv 10 of hellfire warlock if you plan to do so!)\n\n\n---------------------------------------\nHere is a list of changes to current Invocations as well as new Invocations:\n\nLEAST INVOCATIONS\nBaleful Utterance: Cause up to 10d4 sonic damage to target object. Non-construct and non-inanimate objects can make a save to negate the damage.\nBeguiling Influence: You gain a Bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, & Intimdate equal to your Charisma Modifier for 24 hours. \nBreath of Night: An area of darkness appears around you, granting all within concealment - and blinding your enemies if they fail their save. You can only have one area of darkness at a time.\nDevil's Sight: You gain Low-light Vision, Ultravision, skill bonus to Spot & Search equal to your Charisma Modifier, and a small bonus to Dodge AC for 24 hours. The skill bonuses will not stack with the skill bonuses from See the Unseen.\nEarthen Grasp: Any creature that comes within reach of the arm formed from soil will be attacked by the arm, and must make a grapple check or be held in place for 3 seconds - at which time the victim must succeed on a Fort save or also be knocked down and suffer 1d6 + STR modifier points of bludgeoning damage.\nLeaps and Bounds: You gain a Bonus to Tumble & Dexterity equal to your Charisma Modifier for 24 hours.\nMiasmic Cloud: A cloud of noxious looking gas appears around you, doing 1d8 damage to anything it touches not immune to poison. Victims of this noxious gas are also subject to becoming diseased.\nSee the Unseen: You gain See Invisibility, Darkvision, and skill bonus to Spot & Search equal to your Charisma Modifier for 24 hours.. The skill bonuses will not stack with the skill bonuses from Devil's Sight.\nSoulreaving Aura: You are surrounded by darkness that causes damage to creatures with very low hitpoints remaining. If the darkness touches a corpse of a creature, the soul of that corpse is consumed and you're healed slightly.\nSpiderwalk: You gain the benefits of the Freedom of Movement spell, and immunity to the effects of 'Web'. This lasts for 24 hours.\nSummon Swarm: Enemies within a 30' wide area are subject to swarms of biting insects. A swarm must succeed on a melee touch attack to do damage, or dissipate (stop). Swarms do 1d6 + CHA modifier of piercing damage. The caster has no control over how many creatures are targeted by swarms, or which creatures are targeted by swarms. Swarms last for 1 round per caster level.\nOtherworldly Whispers: You gain a skill bonus to Lore, Listen, and Spellcraft equal to your charisma modifier.\nVoice of Madness: Target enemy must make a will save or become momentarily insane, attacking anything it can perceive - friend or foe.\n\nLESSER INVOCATIONS\nCold Comfort: You and all allies who come within earshot of you are granted the benefits of the Endure Elements spell.\nFell Flight: You gain the benefits of the Haste spell for 1 round per caster level.\nFlee the Scene: You turn ethereal for 1 round, gain the effects of Expeditious Retreat for 1 round per caster level, and instantly teleport to the visible location of your choice within 250'. Meanwhile, an exact likeness of yourself (a decoy) is left in the spot you were just in. The decoy will stand in place for 1 round, after which it will completely vanish. The decoy cannot be destroyed by attacks.\nHungry Vapors: A billowing gaseous mass appears around you, as it lingers in place it will do 2d6 damage per round to enemies inside it. You can only have one cloud of Hungry Vapors at a time.\nIgnore the Pyre: You gain an amount of damage resistance equal to your charisma modifier against the selected type of energy.\nStony Grasp: Multiple arms formed from rock and stone continually attack and ram the target creature.\nThe Dead Walk: Summon up to six undead servants that will last for 1 minute per Caster Level. The type of undead summoned is based on your Caster Level, and the number of undead summoned is based on your Charisma Modifier. If there are already servants from this spell alive, they'll turn to dust immediately. This spell will fail if your charisma is below 10!\nVoidsense: You gain Blind Fight (the feat), minor conealment, and a +2 attack bonus to all hit rolls (including ranged touch attacks) for 24 hours.\nWalk Unseen: You become invisible, gain a very slight increase in movement speed, and a bonus to your Hide and Move Silently skill checks equal to your Charisma Modifier for 24 hours. These effects will immediately cancel if your invisibility is dispelled, or you perform any action that cancels the invisibility.\n\nGREATER INVOCATIONS\nChilling Tentacles: Creepy tentacles rise up from the ground to maul, maim, and grope, anything in their reach. Creatures within range are subject to blunt damage, cold damage, spell failure, as well as being grappled by the tentacles. The caster will not be grappled by the tentacles, but still suffers all other ill effects from getting too close.\nEnervating Shadow: For 5 rounds you gain 100% concealment vs. ranged attacks, and 75% concealment vs. melee attacks. At the time of casting, creatures adjacent to you are subject to a -4 STR penalty for 4 rounds. If at any time a bright source of light (torch, lamp, glowing items, light spell effects, etc.) comes within 40' of you, Enervating Shadows will dissipate. Enervating Shadows can NOT be dispelled by Dispel Magic or similar magical means.\nPerilous Flame: 1/2 is fire damage, 1/2 is untyped damaged. Can be cast in one of three ways; targeted on a creature to engulf them, targeted as a wall to make a barrier, or targeted over an area to cause an explosion.\nRetributive Invisibility: Greater invisibility for 3 rounds. If this is dispelled, a shockwave is released that does sonic damage to (and stuns) everything nearby.\nWarlock's Call: For a brief period of time, a pact is made with the hells for temporary servants. Any demon or devil who answers your call will appear to serve you, and should this being fall in combat before the pact's duration is up, another will answer the call to serve you. There is no certaintity behind who or what exactly will answer the call.\nHellspawned Grace: You turn into a Hellcat, gaining all the benefits and abilities a hellcat possesses including light-born invisibility. If you die while as a Hellcat, you reform into your natural form immediately after and the spell ends.\n\nDARK INVOCATIONS\nConsuming Void: Creates a swirling mass of darkness that does 2d6 negative damage to any creature within range every half-round. At the end of 4 rounds, the darkness implodes doing 1d4 crushing damage to anything within range. Only one of these can exist at a time, regardless of who cast it.\nDark Discorperation: You transform into a misty cloud of darkness and travel about, nearly impervious to damage. Creatures in your presence take 4d6 damage at the end of each round. You're still susceptible to AoE spells, however.\nSightful Weirding: Any creature with invisibility or etherealness must make a will save or have these effects stripped, and any creature not affected by these effects must make a will save or become invisible. Creatures failing the will save take 2d6 sonic damage.\nSteal Summon: You steal control of an enemy's summoned creature for 1 hour.\nPath of Shadow: You and some of your companions become ethereal for a while, increased movement speed, and +5 regeneration. This effect ends if a hostile action is taken.\nWord of Changing: You transform into a horned devil for a while, gaining all the natural abilities of the creature without hindering your capacity to use Invocations. However because of the diabolical nature of the invocation, your Charisma is reduced to 10 or lower for the duration of the effect. If you die while transformed, you reform into your natural form in the spot the spell was cast.\n\n---------------------------------------\nThis is a list of Invocations that can be maintained permanently, and automatically, for you via the Warlock Buddy UI architecture. This is version 2.0, if you find a bug with it please let me know.\n\nRetributive Invisibility\nDark One's Own Luck\nLeaps and Bounds\nBeguiling Influence\nOtherworldly Whispers\nDevil's Sight\nSee the Unseen\nEntropic Warding\nWalk Unseen\nVoidsense\nDark Foresight\nPath of Shadow\nFell Flight\nSpiderwalk\nCold Comfort\n*Hideous Blow + Essence hotswapping during combat\n(Enervating Shadow will NOT be added to this list)\n\n---------------------------------------\nFor Epic Warlocks, the feat Epic Fiendish Resilience has been expanded to encompass 7 more stages of Epic Fiendish Resilience. Each one adds +5 more regeneration, and 1 extra use per day. Epic Fiendish Resilience 1 is 25 healing per round, twice a day. Epic Fiendish Resilience 8 is 60 healing per round, nine times per day.\n\nIn addition, the Epic Eldritch Blast feats and Epic Eldritch Master feat have had their requirements lowered to accomidate the multiclassing Warlock, and the Hellfire Warlock.\n\n---------------------------------------\nWarlock Spellcasting can be used to multiclass into either Palemaster, Hellfire Warlock, or Arcane Trickster. Warlock Invocation progression will advance normally for each spellcaster level gained from the prestige class, and Eldritch Blast will increase in damage at every other level with the only exception being that Palemaster's spellcasting starts at level 2, not level 1.\n\nThe requirements for Palemaster and Arcane Trickster have also been changed in order to accomidate Warlock multiclassing as the game does not consider invocations to have an arcane spell level. The changes are as follows:\n\nPalemaster requires:\nnon-good alignment, lore of 8 or more, atleast 1 level as a Sorcerer, Wizard, or Warlock, and the feat Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy.\n\nArcane Trickster requires:\nnon-lawful alignment, 2d6 sneak attack (any kind), lore of 7 or more, tumble of 7 or more, disable device of 7 or more, spellcraft of 4 or more, and at least one level as a Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard, or Warlock.\n\nNo further changes have been made to the two aforementioned prestige classes.\n---------------------------------------\nInstall Instructions (for Windows)\n\n!!WARNING!! Do NOT install this mod while a previous version is still present! To\n!!WARNING!! be sure the compilation is removed from your save game, turn off the \n!!WARNING!! warlock buddy in-game, and either intentionally kill your character or \n!!WARNING!! rest and restore until the character appears \"fresh\". This will help\n!!WARNING!! to prevent dangerous and unfriendly errors from occuring due to how\n!!WARNING!! NWN2 stores script files and gui variables.\n\n\nStep 1) Remove all of the following mods, should you already have them installed.\nKaedrin's PrC Pack\nReeron and Trekari's Spell Fixes and Improvements\nTonyK's Companion and Monster AI\nWarlock Buddy (or any other versions)\nDistillable Loot\nAnd any previous versions of this compilation, of course\n\nStep 2) With that done, the rest is a cake walk! Just place the entire contents of \nthe Combined Works folder in your \"\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\override\\\" folder,\nlocated in \"My Documents\".\n\nStep 3) Move the \"dialog.TLK\" file from the \"\\override\\\" folder to the \"\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\\" \nfolder located in \"My Documents\".\n\nStep 4) Find the folder that Neverwinter Nights 2 was installed to. This is NOT the folder \nlocated in your My Documents folder. Once there, find the folder \"\\UI\\default\\\". \nInside that folder, open the files \"ingamegui.ini\" and \"ingameguix1.ini\". The second \nfile will only appear if you have Mask of the Betrayer installed.\n\nStep 5) Inside these files, under the line that reads \"[MandatoryGUI]\", add this line: \n\nSCREEN_WARLOCK=warlock.xml\n\nanywhere below it - but above the line that reads \"[ExamineGUI]\". Do this for \nBOTH files.\n\nThere are two examples included in this compilation that show you what the finished\nfile should look like. \n\nAnd YES, you MUST change the files in the folder NWN2 was installed in.\n\nStep 6) That wasn't too hard, eh? Well, enjoy your game because you're done installing\nCombined Works!\n\n\nCredits: \n\nDubby, TonyK, Kaedrin, Reeron, Lorrn, Trekari, Draco Rayne, Fuegan, shortbusrider","Rating":9.73,"Votes":29,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"20":{"Name":"CotillionsRope - Combined HAKpak","Author":"CotillionsRope","Submitted":20080217,"Updated":20080224,"Category":"Combos - Other","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"These are a pair of customized combined HAKpaks which I will be referring to in prefab areas which I will be designing.

They contain a very complete selection of all the clothing options and head and hair options available, as well as selected weapons, creatures, tilesets, placeables, and spell effects. The social haks will be maintained and updated, with better version control than I usually bother with.\n\nDoes Eph need help? Yes! I welcome anybody else willing to tackle some detail-chasing grunt-work! What I have is, I think, a great start, but all aspects of it can be improved.\n\nOther features include a set of properly meshed 2da files that support:\n\n1. New icons for nudes, bathing suits, etc.\n2. The \"closeness enhancement\" where players can get within kissing range.\n3. PC Tools is included for more emotes, props, and dice rolls.\n4. Broader content than any available in any single server.\n5. Override directories can be cleaned out for server stability.\n6. Players can switch from server to server without downloading entirely separate haks with largely duplicate content. (2.1 GB and counting!) ( Eek! Cancel that!

It's goal is to provide compatibility between projects, fix technical issues and some editorial review, and also to encourage multiple parties using the same haks to encourage players not having to download as much. Please Vote for the original projects on their various pages and check with those authors for usage permissions. They did all the work, i am just grouping it together to provide convenience. As far as i know this includes all vault content related to appearance.2da except for the kuo toa which Hellfire is working on fixing to have full animations ( in his next release. )\n\nIt is also designed so you can use the appearance.2da provided and nothing else, or just the haks which relate to your module, which should make what you do more compatible with other peoples haks. They are in separate downloads to make it so you can choose which portions you use, if you are already using always summer for example you probably won't use the appearance.hak.\n\nThe inspiration for this came about because as a scripter, i have found that creatures happen to use multiple rows, multiple constants, which makes it very hard to make code that knows about custom creatures and the creature constants provided officially refer to numerous nonexistant creatures. I hope this is helpful for whoever implements the master of many forms or other projects.\n\nMostly updated except for blueprints and checking all the documentation and credits.\n\nThis includes \n\n1) Many of the monsters from the vault combined into a single entry.\n\n2) Complete Packages for each individual Major Studio ( Bouncy Rock, Races of Faerun, Purgatorio, SBRage, Creature Companion Pack, NWN1 style Familiars, Monster Conversions of DLA and NWN1 creatures, Robinson Workshop ) ( ROF is the partial to conserve file size )\n\n3) Optional Supporting Gear and Appearance Packs for gear held by some creatures, this is mainly for those who don't have these already. ( Trident's as weapons because the merpeople need them, pitchforks for the devils, more revealing outfits for the devils, etc. ) Includes portions of \n\n4) Entirely reworked to minimize file size. This is not complete versions of all the packages, about half of ROF was omitted, and only that which is needed by creatures is in the appearance pack. Attempt to get a breadth of options within the given download size. Some additions of tint maps or minor tweaks.\n\n5) Comes with a integration to my Script library and a custom appearance.2da. Creatures have a custom set of constants which do not have incorrect entries and fluff from NWN1. This includes functions to get a creatures height, to flip a creatures sex ( based on 2drunk's work ), to iterate creatures ( Next Appearance, Previous appearance for DM's ) and to get an appearance name without a 2da Lookup. I've also included many other adjustments, the 1st person camera view, as well as adjusted the size of the selection circle.

Very Easy. Drop \"Ugly_Ducks Loadscreen Pack Volume 2 OVERRIDE\" folder into your /My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/Override folder.\n2.) Easy. Drop \"Ugly_Ducks Loadscreen Pack Volume 2.hak\" file into your /My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/HAK folder. Open the toolset and start a module, then select \"View\" from the menu at the top left of the toolset, then from the drop-down menu, select \"Module Properties\". In the properties window that appears, go to \"Hak Packs\". From here you can select the Loadscreen Pack & assign it to the module.\n\nTo see/use the new screens AFTER using either method above, open the toolset & select and open the area you want to place a loadscreen onto. In the Properties Window, go down to \"Load Screen\" and scroll through all 50 of the new screens! They should be at the top of the screens list because of the way I numbered them - example: 001_Mountains_Crystal_001.\n\nFinally, pick the one you want, save the module, then run the module.

While using shadow magic a caster cannot produce light for example. Permanency spells cost XP and Circle Magic will greatly boost the circle master's caster level.\n\nBlood magic costs hitpoints to cast as is seen in Dragon Age and doubles the casterlevel. I couldn't find a good parralel for this in the D&D universe although I'm quite sure that it exists.\n\nOther content includes the spells: Contingency, Chain Contingency, Limited Wish, Wish, Repulsion, Gaseous Form, Spell Turning Lesser and Greater, Vocalize (auto still cast for the duration), Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magical Weapons and more for around 60 new spells that add a great deal of versatility to wizards. \n\nNote: Far from all spells are exclusive to wizards / sorcerors. Quite a few can be cast by bards or even druids and clerics if appropriate according to D&D rules.\n\n\n\nFor Players: This is an override mod with a TLK file. Installation is like Kaedrin's or TOB would be installed. The files go in their respective folders.\n \n\nFor Developers: This is intended mostly as a source project to build from. It can be included as is and will be patched once I have a list of bugs. If desireable I can also upload the original unmerged files which don't include the Tome of Battle or Kaedrin's PrC.\n\n\nThis package does not transform your game into a turn based combat mod.

All assets are free to use, alter and distribute provided credit is given. I will not be making a non replacing pack for this project due to the sheer amount of work involved in completing it let alone renaming potentially upwards of a hundred models. \n\nThe reason I decided to go this route is because I wanted to play through the game again but could not bare to look at the character creation screen. As a hobbyist character artist its just one of those things I can't forgive. This way, not only does the character creation screen get a much needed face-lift but so too will the NPCs in the game, I am already working on the companions/NPC heads as well as the race heads so keep checking in here for updates.\n\nFeel free to use my work to create non replacing versions, re-textures, variations, new races and whatever else you lovely imaginative people can conceive and above all, enjoy the project :)\n\nXaltar\n\nOn a side note I would like to state that these heads are not ported from the dragon age toolset, they are all created in 3d studio max. The only thing that was ported is a custom head mod of my own creation that was initially created for Dragon age. I am sorry if this has caused any confusion, sadly there is no way to port head morphs from dragon age into any other game. The head that I started from was a head that I created and imported into DA:O for a project I was working on, it turned out to be unsuitable for my needs for the project so I decided to make use of it for NWN 2.
