Of course, I immediately made one into a player character and ran it through a gauntlet of tests, all the while taking screenshots. This is the best model I have seen yet! Here are some of those screenshots, turned into portraits. Just some action shots and a couple of antiqued repeats to give that 'Nosferatu' look.

The pic was cropped and reddened heavily from a wallpaper found on the MagicBox news website. The pic itself is most suited to fighter characters, given that a huge sword is seen worn on Dante's back (it's Sparda, by the way), but can be applicable to humans, elves, or half-elves.

A portrait of Minsc inspired by Sporeboy who wanted to make his own BG portraits. I decided I wanted to do some also. At first I only wanted to do Boo, but then again: what's Boo without Minsc? Created from a picture of Christian Slater (quite tricky to make him bald but I feel it kind of worked), added some armour pieces and leather stuff to create armour. Hand also added. Boo was created from a hamster pic, but I ended up repainting a lot of his fur. I really tried to give it that BG portrait feel, with the armour and all, and I feel I have partly succeeded. The zipfile contains the entire image of them both, but I also added a version of Boo alone, for those who like it. Hope you like him ...

This 'deep' nature of his is why his charisma suffers, despite the very good looks he posesses.

A lot of work went into the texturing of the armor, I wanted it to look rough and earthy, thus the unrefined iron look...but at the same time I wanted it to show the craftsmanship and magic of dwarven smiths, ala the smooth satiny gold and the glowing glass/crystal spikes and device on his shield. Let me know if I got the impression I wanted across, please =). Anyhow, I hope you like them, and I hope that you all take these three pictures as a big thanks for all the things I've downloaded from you all.

What they did not tell Vasmordia, was that it was in the possession of her god, whom these new companions secretly plotted to slay. When the time came, and the god was dealt a mortal wound, Vasmordia surprised everyone when she finished her former god off herself, taking the \"Gauntlet of Necromantic Divinity\" from his cold form and placing it upon her slender hand. At once, she was transformed and in the suddenness of her newfound godhood, she went mad. Vasmordia slew all those who had plotted against her god in that hour, raising them as undead servants bound unto her will; she took her place upon the death god's throne for all eternity. So goes her legend. Keep all of the portraits upside down so Nwn can read them. I have also included everything you have come to expect from my packs: the portraits, of course; the .jpg; and the readme file. I've used a wholly new bag of visual tricks and treats for this one, so I hope everyone likes it; it marks a vast improvement over some of my older stuff.

Actually, let me clarify that - the paintings are great, it's the depiction of Rand I dislike. He's supposed to be this big, young guy with red hair and the book covers have him as a short 45 year old guy with blond hair. Go figure. So this is how I picture Rand al'Thor. Probably very female of me... though he's too pretty I think.

All portraits have the artist credit listed on them.\n\nThe initial pack has 43 female portraits suitable for multiple classes - monk, bard, sorceress, wizard, druid, cleric and rogue. It also has six male portraits for warriors and rogues, one that is actually a dragon's head spewing fire.\n\nEdit Note: There is one portrait from the artwork on Bowser's site that I did not include in the original pack because it has been available on the vault for awhile (uploaded by OmegaAxis), whereas the others are all new ones I just created this past week. The portrait of Cascade is here. I have included a color corrected version of Cascade in the 2nd pack added on Sept 9.\n\n\nVisit the artist's website at www.jonathonart.com\n\nSept 9 Update: I've added a second pack of images of Bowser's work. Some are earlier works, some later and you will definitely see an evolution in his style in these as well as different mediums he has used. \n\nA couple of these new portraits are variations on ones in the original pack - the variations do not override the original portrait from the first pack. \nThere are 4 male and 44 female portraits in this new pack and I think you will see lot of variety in this pack. I believe there is something that should appeal to everyone here - sketches, oils, headshots, heads and torsos and even a furry.\n\nThe new images come from his website referenced above or from dealer licensed to sell his work at GreatMasterpieces.com.\n\nAll artwork depicted in all images in both packs is his work and all images contain the artist credit. \n\n\nWARNING: Many of these new portraits contain some partial or full nudity. The human body is beautiful and Bowser's handling of it is masterful but it is only fair to let people know what to expect. I have included these portraits because of their beauty and out of respect for the artist's talent and work. \n\nThe screenshot I am uploading to the vault of the new portraits is masked so as not to offend anyone. The masking only appears on this screenshot and not in the portraits themselves.

She sang her predictions, which she received from Gaia. Later, \"Sibyl\" became a title given to whichever priestess manned the oracle at the time. The Sibyl sat on the Sibylline Rock, breathing in vapors from the ground and gaining her often puzzling predictions from that. Pausanias claimed that the Sibyl was \"born between man and goddess, daughter of sea monsters and an immortal nymph\". Others said she was sister or daughter to Apollo. Still others claimed the Sibyl received her powers from Gaia originally, who passed the oracle to Themis, who passed it to Phoebe.\n\nThis oracle exerted considerable influence across the country, and was consulted before all major undertakings: wars, the founding of colonies, and so forth. She also was respected by the semi-Hellenic countries around the Greek world, such as Lydia, Caria, and even Egypt. Croesus of Lydia consulted Delphi before attacking Persia, and according to Herodotus received the answer \"if you do, you will destroy a great empire.\" Croesus found the response favorable and attacked, and was utterly overthrown (resulting, of course, in the destruction of his own empire).\n\nThe oracle is also said to have proclaimed Socrates the wisest man in Greece, to which Socrates said that if so, this was because he alone was aware of his own ignorance. This claim is related to one of the most famous mottos of Delphi, which Socrates said he learned there, Gnothi Seauton: \"know thyself\". Another famous motto of Delphi is Meden Agan: \"nothing in excess\".","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"4471":{"Title":"Woodsman","Author":"VurdalacK","Submitted":20051116,"Updated":20051116,"Category":"Half-Orc","Gender":"Male","Format":".rar","Description":"Woodsman by Keel, fantasy illustrator.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"4472":{"Title":"Delan - Half-elf Rogue","Author":"Lorimim","Submitted":20051119,"Updated":20051126,"Category":"Rogue","Gender":"Female","Format":".zip","Description":"This is the in-game portrait of Delan Penhallow for Tales of Celts.

Vlad III Dracula (November 1431 � December 1476), has also been known as Dracula (also Drăculea), or Vlad the Impaler (Vlad Ţepeş in Romanian). Vlad III was the voivode, or prince, of the principality of Wallachia (what is today an informal region in southern Romania). His three reigns were in 1448, from 1456 to 1462, and 1476. His surname 'Dracula' seems to come from his father's surname 'Dracul', due to the 'Order of the Dragon' he got from the Emperor Sigismund.\nAs voivode he led an independent policy in relation to the Ottoman Empire, and in Romania at least he is best remembered as a Christian knight crusading against Islamic expansionism into Europe and a prince with deep sense of justice. He is known in Turkish as Kazıklı Bey, or the Impaler Prince, Outside of Romania he is known by the exaggerated tales of atrocities (many of which stem from records of debatable authenticity), and even more so - the title of vampire and as the main character of Bram Stoker's 1897 horror novel, Dracula � to the point where he is thought to be the inspiration for it. It has been suggested that this connection stemmed from a certain grotesque eating habit of Vlad's. Rumour has it he would consume bread dipped in his victims' blood and he refused to eat anywhere but in his garden where he had his enemies impaled on 6 foot stakes that were driven into the ground.\nHis impact on Ottoman Empire expansion is recognizable in that his successful war against the Ottomans bought precious time for western Europe.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"4921":{"Title":"Male Elf","Author":"blank","Submitted":20060705,"Updated":20060705,"Category":"Elf","Gender":"Male","Format":"tga","Description":"A portrait i created from a photo of myself :)","Rating":6,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"4922":{"Title":"Dark Justice- Haunted Angel set","Author":"Haunted Angel","Submitted":20060705,"Updated":20070228,"Category":"Other","Gender":"Portrait Pack","Format":"Rar","Description":"A compilement of portaits i use that are custom..

The trick was to choose movies where costumes, props, etc. would match a D&D environment, without any further modification. Sometimes an accurate cropping of the picture does it all (eg. look how Kidman's broomstick turns into a mage's staff!)\nPictures were either taken from the net, or captured from DVDs. Added brightness, and applied an edge-preserving smooth filter where needed, to erase imperfections and add a somewhat painted feel. Huge and large portraits usually show the actor in action, while medium-sized portraits are close-ups, carefully focused so that it won't appear blurry.\n\nUses for these portraits are multiple:\n\n* You could play your favorite actor or actress as a PC\n* Load them as a bunch of NPCs in your modules (eg. Gibson as a Ranger, Heston as a Paladin, Allen as an Illusionist/Gnome, Schwarzy as... guess what).\n* If you manage to portrait every role in your module, you could see it as a blockbuster film, with an awesome casting (and an impossible one too, as some of these actors are dead or too old to play with the others)\n* Eventually, you could make them play their own part, in a cheesy-scenario-module named \"Escape from Hollywood Spectral Plane\", where an evil wizard trapped the souls of famous actors, forcing them to replay indefinitely their same famous roles, in a parallel plane, where you must go to save them. When you'll save Raquel Welch, don't forget to collect your reward :-)\n\nSuch a project would require much more portraits, for there's only 36 in that pack, portraying 13 actors/actresses. If someone is interested, I could easily make more and update the pack...\n\nFeel free to comment/vote! \n\n\n\n\n**** Updated to version 1.01 ****\n\n* Oups! I made a mistake, giving some files names longer than 16 characters, and apparently NWN's localvault can't display the picture when the name is too long! Problem fixed in that version. Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n * I also added a modified version of *Unknown*'s Drew Barrymore with modified proportions.\n\nThere's 37 portraits of 15 actors/actresses in the pack now.\n\n","Rating":9.19,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"5039":{"Title":"Lina Inverse","Author":"supertrainer_sylvant","Submitted":20060803,"Updated":20060804,"Category":"Sorcerer","Gender":"Female","Format":".tga","Description":"Files for a portrait of Lina Inverse from Slayers.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"5040":{"Title":"Christian Bale-Monk/Assassin/Shadowdancer","Author":"Zyraxes","Submitted":20060803,"Updated":20060804,"Category":"Assassin","Gender":"Male","Format":"zip","Description":"Screenshots from Batman Begins modified by me.

In this pack, there are some that I did extensive alterations and work to, and some I did little more than adust lighting on and make a portrait out of.\n\nAlso, in this pack, there are a couple of painted art pieces, in the vein of Julie Bell, Boris Vallejo, Luis Royo, Frank Frazetta, and so on. I don't recall who, exactly, did these, but they are of that sort of quality and appearance.\n\nThis set features Antonio Banderas as an elf and a human; David Batista as a fighter/barbarian type; a female paladin/blackguard/fighter type; Gerard Butler as a rogue, etc; Heather Christensen as a mermaid (I had to play with this one a bit to make it work as a portrait); Jennifer Connelly in several shots as a bard, druid, etc; Lucy Lawless as what else, a fighter; two male fighter/barbarian types; a male angel and a dark winged angel; and two female barbarian/fighter types\n\nAll together, there are 22 portraits included in this pack. I hope you enjoy them and get good use out of them.\n\nCheck out my other work on here as well. Just do a search for \"Psycho Circus\" and you should find them easy enough.

She's a Half-Elf barbarian of the Anauroch Desert. Her tribe dwelt on the South-Eastern edge near Elvish Evereska. Her tribe was typical of most barbarian tribes in the area, close to the environs that they dwelt in, hers being a hostile desert, her tribe was especially resistant to the wilds and hardships of nature.\n\nNot being great lovers of civilized people; her tribe tended to ambush any travelers that happened to be unfortunate enough to think that a shortcut crossing the desert was a good idea. More so for Valen's father, an Elvish merchant from Evereska traveling by caravan to Dagger Falls on the Western edge of the desert. He and his caravan were taken not three leagues from his destination. \n\nValen's Clan tended to be a mix of many races. It was their custom to regularly take the strongest of any of their victims as slaves and then mate with them in order to strengthen the clan. They firmly believed the diversity in bloodlines was the only way to survive. Valen's mother took the Elvish merchant as a slave, and thus Valen made her appearance into the world.\n\nValen's mother, Ervynn, was a highly placed member of the tribe and, as a result, Valen had access to the best warriors and equipment for training, her slow rate of aging only gave her more time to improve her skills as a warrior. It wasn�t long before she was a challenging opponent to even the best warriors in her clan.\n\nShe earned her name on her 13th birthday. She and a few friends were on a hunt in the nearby mountains when they encountered a particularly large mountain lion. It immediately attacked the smallest member of the hunting party, almost killing him. Valan charged the beast while her companions were still drawing their weapons. Without hesitation she killed it with her spear in one quick strike, and thus saving her friends.\n\nIt wasn't long before Valen was leading raids on her own and tales began to gather about her skills in battle. She was soon the talk of all of the clans in the region.\n\nNot long after her 21st birthday Valen� clan became involved in a war of sorts. Two tribes in the same clan, her own and another, began a dispute over territory that soon evolved into outright conflict. Valen's tribe fell to the hands of the rival tribe and her people were all but destroyed.\n\nShe escaped with a few others but now they were homeless nomads.\nThe others soon began to slip away, joining other clans, wandering on their own to meet whatever fate lay before them. Eventually Valen found herself alone, wandering the vast edges of the desert.�\n","Rating":7,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"5183":{"Title":"Dark Elf","Author":"Night Assassin","Submitted":20061105,"Updated":20061105,"Category":"Elf","Gender":"Male","Format":"Targa","Description":"dark elf from lineage ","Rating":8.25,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"5184":{"Title":"Mask Man","Author":"Night Assassin","Submitted":20061105,"Updated":20061105,"Category":"Human","Gender":"Male","Format":"Targa","Description":"mask man good for rogue and assasin","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"5185":{"Title":"Female Knight","Author":"Night Assassin","Submitted":20061105,"Updated":20061105,"Category":"Human","Gender":"Female","Format":"Targa","Description":"female knight from kingdom under fire","Rating":8.58,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"5186":{"Title":"Niz","Author":"Me","Submitted":20061105,"Updated":20070531,"Category":"Other","Gender":"Female","Format":"tga","Description":"Personal portrait.

She's a digital painting using Corel Painter, without reference. Not perfect, but I think it captures the atmosphere.\n\n\"This young woman in her late teenage years radiates a needle-sharp alertness and flighty energy as tangibly as heat from a flame, giving the strong impression of a wary animal. And like a wild animal, it might be very difficult to judge whether she is tensed to run or ready to strike. Her expression of malign mistrust suggests that either is possible, and indeed probable.\n\nWith her soft, stormy-grey eyes, her delicately carved features and raven-black hair, she might be considered a great beauty, though like so much about her, this impression is marred by her outward personality. Were she to smile, or to sleep or sit in absent-minded thought, the quality of her features would be clear to see, but it is so rare for her to be seen to do any of these things that few have had the opportunity to judge.\n\nLike her demeanour, her otherwise unblemished skin is marred: about the wrists, on her forearms and across her back there are long and vicious scars that speak of painful mistreatment, though she takes little care to cover them, and one might even perceive a kind of angry defiance in this flaunting of her disfigurements.\n\nIn body she is of a light but athletic build, slightly taller than the average and apparently a little underfed and wiry, though never skinny or gangly. Her leg muscles suggest long practice in running and evading, and though the scars on her wrists appear still to cause her pain, she does not appear weak or stiff in her movements.\"\n","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"5644":{"Title":"Smiling Teen AJ","Author":"Miggy","Submitted":20080120,"Updated":20080124,"Category":"Human","Gender":"Female","Format":"rar","Description":"A picture I edited for my friend.

Since it was released it has also been adopted by the Dungeon Eternal X Action / PvP server.\n\nClick here to visit the Trials of Newcastle Role Playing NWN Persistent World website.\n\nIt is a good tool for PW servers to allow diversity in character portraits whilst encouraging the ability for all players to see the portraits for other characters. It is also useful for players who simply want a very large selection of options when playing in single player mode.\n\nWe did not produce the original artwork in the portraits, however in some cases we did splice images together to give backgrounds to images that originally had a single colour background. We created the Pack to allow players to access these portraits in one location as a 'set' for use on a PW server. \n\nAll credit for individual pictures should go to their individual creators.\n\nThis Pack includes:\n- Over 800 portraits in total\n- Over 300 portraits, compiled from different packs and individual portraits available on various NWN sites over a few years.\n- Over 500 portraits that we have converted for use with NWN from artwork found on the web.\n- Portraits for a wide range of the subraces used on NWN servers \n\nInstructions:\n- To ensure you don�t lose your personal collection, move or re-name your existing portraits folder first, create a new folder called �portraits� in your NWN directory and extract the pack into the new folder.\n\n\nFuture Updates:\nIf you have images, which can�t be found within this portrait pack, and would like them added, please contact us and if appropriate they will certainly be added.\n\nWARNING: This updated Portrait Pack will NOT be backwards compatible with the first release of the Newcastle Portraits Pack.\n \nAll future updates will however be compatible with this version.\n\nPlease read on before downloading.\n\nWhy is it not backwards compatible? \nOver the years, so many awesome portraits have been submitted and used in many different compilation packs, many being duplicated with different file names.\n\nWhat has been done differently here is this� \n\nALL files that have been gathered over our years of playing, along with some 500 new portraits have been renamed/named in a very methodical way so that portraits of the same race/gender will show already categorized. We have even included small Race/Subrace Category Sorter Images to help people find that perfect image that will run the life of their character in-game.\n\nWhen placed into an empty portrait folder in your NWN Directory, all of these images will list beneath the Bioware NWN standard images.\n\n\nServers Using this Portrait Pack:\n\n- Trials of Newcastle\n- Dungeon Eternal X\n\n\nIf you would like your server added to this list message the me with a link to your forums showing the Pack being listed as one of your downloads.\n\n\nAlso Available:\n\nDrow, Demon and Vampire Portraits Expansion Pack\nThis Expansion Portrait Pack includes 142 Drow, Demon, Vampire and general Undead portraits and is a great addition for players who visit servers where those types of characters are permitted. It is however not used on the Trials of Newcastle Role Playing Persistent World.\n\nDrow, Demon and Vampire Portraits Expansion Pack 2\nAdded: 14-09-2008\nThis Expansion Portrait Pack includes 40 additional Drow, Demon, Vampire and general Undead portraits that for the most part have been included following requests by players. It is however not used on the Trials of Newcastle Role Playing Persistent World.\n\nNewcastle Portrait Pack: Expansion Pack 14-09-2008\nThis has been released to expand upon the already considerable Newcastle Portrait Pack as well as fix a few errors made initially. It includes over 175 additional portraits.\n\n1. Some double-up on images were reported/found - these have been replaced with new images.\n\n2. A few images have been redone to increase their quality.\n\n3.

Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645) é um dos heróis nacionais do Japão. Vivendo num período histórico de transição, onde os tradicionais métodos dos samurais eram aos poucos substituídos por armas de fogo (ainda primitivas), ele simbolizou o auge do bushido (caminho do guerreiro), onde um homem com uma espada na mão representava o máximo da realização individual.\n\nVários espadachins percorriam o país, alguns simplesmente procurando um adversário famoso como forma de promoção, outros realmente buscando aperfeiçoar sua técnica. Musashi era um destes aventureiros. Como narra na introdução de O Livro dos Cinco Anéis, nunca foi derrotado em combate, apesar de ter enfrentado mais de sessenta oponentes, algumas vezes mais de um simultaneamente.\n\nMusashi nasceu na aldeia de Miyamoto, província de Mimasaka, e se chamava \"Shinmen Musashi No Kami Fujiwara No Genshin\". De seu pai, Shinmen Munisai, um \"goushi\" (pequeno fidalgo rural, algo entre um camponês e um samurai), teve as primeiras lições com a espada. Aos treze anos, travou seu primeiro duelo, vencendo o então famoso espadachim Arima Kibei.\n\nMas sua maior proeza talvez seja a de ter criado um estilo de luta com duas espadas, chamado Niten Ichi Ryu, onde seus discípulos e praticantes têm acesso aos katas e estratégias que o tornou imbatível pelos sessenta duelos. Vale lembrar que, apesar do estilo Niten Ichi Ryu ser conhecido pela luta com duas espadas, contém técnicas com a espada maior (tachi seiho), espada menor(kodatchi seiho) e o bastão longo , o bojutsu. Um dos fios condutores da narrativa de Musashi é exatamente o nascimento deste estilo, desde a primeira idéia, instintiva, até as poéticas considerações sobre a luta com duas armas.\n\nAlém de ter sido um duelista imbatível, Musashi também se dedicou a outras artes, como a pintura[4] caligrafia e a escultura, e chegou a escrever livros sobre esgrima e estratégia.\n\nEm 1643, ele se retirou em uma caverna conhecida como Reigand&#333;, a oeste da cidade de Kumamoto. Como eremita escreveu o então seu tratado mais conhecido, o Livro dos Cinco Anéis ou\"Gorin No Sho\". \"Go\" significa cinco,\"rin\" significa anéis ,e \"sho\" significa escrito, pergaminho ou livro. Concluiu no segundo mês de 1645.\n\nEm 1645, no décimo segundo dia do quinto mês (data japonesa), sentindo a aproximação da morte, Musashi liberou-se de suas posses materiais após entregar a cópia manuscrita do Livro dos Cinco Anéis a seu discípulo mais próximo, o irmão mais novo de Terao Magonojo. Ele faleceu em Kumamoto por volta do dia dezenove do quinto mês, segundo o calendário japonês da época[5] [6].\n\nA história de sua vida tornou-se uma lenda e forte inspiração para o imaginário japonês, inspirando diversas gravuras Ukiyo-e, livros, filmes, séries de TV, mangás e vídeogames.\n\n[ Esta é uma modesta homenagem a essa grande personalidade oriental ]\n\n[ fonte: Link ]","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"5727":{"Title":"Cult of Set Holy Symbols","Author":"The Ultima Restoration Project","Submitted":20080514,"Updated":20080516,"Category":"Arcane Archer","Gender":"Portrait Pack","Format":"TGA","Description":"For all your serpent cult needs!\n\n\"Contemplate this on the Tree of Woe...\"\n\n(off-topic creations for learning purposes, looked good enuf to post so we did!)\n\n- The Ultima Restoration Project\nLink","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"5728":{"Title":"Thulsa Doom Portraits","Author":"The Ultima Restoration Project","Submitted":20080514,"Updated":20080605,"Category":"Cleric","Gender":"Male","Format":"TGA","Description":"Definitely one of Fantasy Bad-Guy Top-10.\n\n\"Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.

Lovecraft. Here, you will find the Great Old Ones in all of their hideous and eldritch splendor... Atlach-Nacha, Chaugnar Faugn, Cthugha, Great Cthulhu, Dagon, Eihort, Glaaki, Hastur, Ithaqua, Nyogtha, Tsathoggua, Y'golonac, Yig, and Zvilpogghua. Here, you will also find the mysterious Outer Gods such as:\nAzathoth, Nyarlathotep, Shub N'Grath, and Yog-Sothoth. Gathered from the very farthest, darkest corners of the Web, I've collected their portraits and made them useable in Neverwinter Nights as NPCs, Boss Monsters, or whatever you like. And, there's even more terrors of the outer darkness to marvel at... Deep One, Elder Thing, Flying Polyp, Mi-Go, Night-Gaunt, Pickman's Model, Shoggoth, and Yith as well. A fan of Lovecraft, or of unusual creatures in general?\nThen this portrait pack is definately sure to please you for aeons to come!\n\nThe Cthulhu Mythos Portrait Pack comes in two flavors: CEPv2.0 version and Nwn v1.68 version. Use whichever you need.\nNone of these unique portraits has been assigned a specific gender, due to the truly ambiguous nature of the creatures depicted. All of the portraits are set up to appear in the toolset under plot portraits, so they will be easy to find and make use of for module builders. ;)\n\nNote: I've kept the exact same .2da row numbers for both the CEP and non-CEP versions of this pack. The numbers are 3671 to 3696. That way, folks who later decide to switch versions won't have to redo creatures given these portraits. :D\n\nUpdate: There are now two new versions of this pack: one for Nwn v1.69 and one for CEPv2.1... for these new versions, the .2da row numbers are 5000 to 5025, and they are the same in both of these versions of this portrait pack. - Enjoy!\n","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"5754":{"Title":"fstealth","Author":"bolero","Submitted":20080706,"Updated":20080707,"Category":"Rogue","Gender":"Female","Format":"tga","Description":"fstealth","Rating":9.5,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"5755":{"Title":"sixpak","Author":"bolero","Submitted":20080713,"Updated":20080713,"Category":"Other","Gender":"Female","Format":"tga","Description":"It's a Six Pack!

This is another go at Eleri, my Sindar druid on Wireplay's Untold Tales of Tolkien II server Link. For those characters who are most important in my roleplay, I often get itchy about their portraits and redo them several times. The last attempt for Eleri was... mediocre to say the least. Hopefully this one is a little better. Just to be clear, this is a digital painting, NOT, repeat NOT a photo manipulation. It's not easier to do than oil painting, and I know this because I do both. (I've had people mark me down in the past because they thought it was just a PS filter on a photo)\n\nAnd commentary and thoughts are very welcome, more than downloads by a long way. \n\n\nWhy is she naked? In the reference photo the model is wearing some stupid shiny silver swimming gear, which makes her look a little tarty; completely at odds with the power of her expression, and after painting all that skin it seemed a shame to cover it up with some half-baked armour. So - she is an elf, she is by the sea. Think of it as natural, uninhibited elfy behaviour rather than sleazy nude shot.\n\nAs the person who painted a piece, it is often easy to overlook things that seem obvious to others seeing it to the first time, so.... thoughts? suggestions? oversights?

This is Braint, a Dunlending character on Wireplay's Untold Tales of Tolkien II server.

I find I need to point this out, since I get voted down by people who think it's another photo manipulation or celebrity photo nearly every time. Hope you like it!\n\nPeople who have seen King Arthur will no doubt recognise the costume... this is a little unfortunate, since I'd have left the top off in order to make more of the warpaint, but since whenever we see a white woman (as opposed to an african or amazonian tribeswoman) bare-breasted there are connotations of sex, which I wanted to avoid. She's supposed to be a fast and dangerous warrior, and definitely not a pin-up, so I went with the guinevere-esque costume as a way to convey a feel of pre-roman british tribes (celts), which I'm sure Tolkien's Dunlendings are partly based upon.\n\nIf you have an opinion, please rate it and leave any comments or suggestions...

Considering that this was my first attempt at painting hair, I'm pretty pleased with the result, although I'm open to suggestions on how to make it look better. The only part I'm not pleased with right now is his right eye. It looks a little dead compared to his left which I added a shine to. I've tried applying a shine to the other one but it just looks wrong no matter where I put it. I'd be very happy if someone could help me solve this problem.\n\nI'm considering making a series of portraits for this module if there's a demand for it.

A couple of years ago I made a portrait for my character Vesp/Aewen on the Untold Tales of Tolkien 2 server, and now I've redone it. I always liked something about that early version (Vesp redone, it was called - something like that), so even though I've done several versions of this character I thought I'd have one last go, and I think I've got it this time.\n\nIt's a DIGITAL PAINTING, -not- a photo manipulation. I feel I have to point this out, since I always get rated down by people who don't get the distinction. This took me about 25-30 hours to paint, in the way one would an oil painting (but using a pen tablet and photoshop), so I hope you like it and make good use of it. ;)\n\nCheers, TSP","Rating":10,"Votes":10,"Awards":[]},"6193":{"Title":"Elvira Portrait","Author":"Karmapoint","Submitted":20101016,"Updated":20101016,"Category":"Generic","Gender":"Female","Format":"tga","Description":"A portrait of Elvira, to use in any human female character.","Rating":7.5,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"6194":{"Title":"Subitus","Author":"Unknown","Submitted":20101022,"Updated":20101022,"Category":"Cleric","Gender":"Male","Format":".rar","Description":"This is the portrait I use for Subitus.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"6195":{"Title":"Pharius","Author":"Michael Komarck","Submitted":20101024,"Updated":20101024,"Category":"Drow","Gender":"Male","Format":".rar","Description":"Suitable for a Drow Male; Rogue, Wizard or otherwise.","Rating":9.88,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"6196":{"Title":"Valenya 'Moonblade'","Author":"Moonwhisper","Submitted":20101029,"Updated":20101029,"Category":"Cleric","Gender":"Female","Format":"RAR","Description":"Priestess of the Moonmaiden (Selune)\n\n[Model: Rhona Mitra]","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"6197":{"Title":"Modern National Flags","Author":"Viktor Mikhailovich Korsakov","Submitted":20101030,"Updated":20111115,"Category":"Other","Gender":"Portrait Pack","Format":".zip","Description":"This is my Modern National Flags (MNF) portrait pack.
