Please look at the creatures stats and special creature items and adjust them accordingly to make them more compatible for your module. I customized creature skins and weapons considerably on some of these critters. I would not recommend using these as is in any conventional module without serious tweaking. There are also a couple of much lower level creatures available in the zip file, but the bulk of it is to challenge more of the uber types.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"137":{"Title":"Fallen Planetar","Author":"Ajantis","Submitted":20040626,"Updated":20040628,"Category":"Outsider (Evil)","Class1":"Other / ","AC":"34","Race":"Other","NPC":"Yes","HD / HP":"113","Scripts Included?":"No","Dialog Included?":"No","Gender":"Female","Size":"Medium","Alignment":"Chaotic Evil","Description":"I remember playing Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal and seen the Dark Solar as well as perhaps other various evil Celestial counterparts.

It has not been tested under other versions. You can try it but it's not guaranteed to work without HOTU. The system it was developed on had HOTU installed but not SOU, so SOU is not required. Allows you to add pre-scripted NPCs into your module that act like drunk commoners. They stumble around mumbling and arguing with themselves and perform a variety of behaviors. They engage in combat but as soon as you break off the attack they heal, go back to being drunks, forget you attacked them and become neutral.

You can, of course, modify them once placed into your module to change their defaults just as you would for any standard NPC, placeable, or door that you use. After installing the package into your module (as described in the read-me file), you will see new custom entries in the Custom NPC, placeable, and door palettes under the Special Custom 1 category called Port Me NPC, Port Me Portal, and Port Me Door. To put one into your module, view the area that you want it in then simply click on the custom palette entry and click where you want it in the area. It works just like a creature, placeable, or door chosen from the standard palettes does. You then edit the NPC's, portal's, or door's Variables (in its properties window on the Advanced tab) to customize the destination list. See the Readme file for installation instructions and user's guide.\n\nVersion 1.1- Added the Port Me Portal (placeable) and the Port Me Door (door) to the custom palettes.

If the Rust Monster was retained as Hostile, it would be attacking deer and ravens even though it only eats metal and otherwise is pacifistic. Acid attacks are gone. Several changes should be adopted, the foremost being adding some sort of perception ability to the rust monster to 'sniff' metal objects at a 'long' perception range, at which point the perception range of the Rust Monster as I set it should be manually returned to Default. Also, if someone who can script could make the rust monster 'eat' iron armor *without* attacking, it would be more accurate to the ruleset.","Rating":5,"Awards":[]},"340":{"Title":"Rust Monster","Author":"Lordemil","Submitted":20020730,"Updated":20020809,"Category":"Aberration","Class1":"Other / 01","Challenge Rating":"03","Level1":"01","Level2":"01","NPC":"Yes","HD / HP":"75 or so","Scripts Included?":"Yes","Level3":"01","Dialog Included?":"No","Type":"1","Gender":"Male","Description":"Acid spitting rust monster.

You can configure the NPCs to cast either Arcane or Divine spells (or both types) with a spell level of 3 or less. The cost is customizable and is based on a flat service fee, the level of the NPC selling/casting the spell, and the level of the spell purchased. The NPC is capable of dynamically changing behavior in regards to what he sells and for how much, although it is up to the builder to write the scripts that customize the NPC on-the-fly. A library of functions is included in the package to assist in on-the-fly customizations.

The .erf also adds custom placeable cocoons, which will spawn a horde of spiderlings when destroyed (spell casters will need to be careful of their area effect spells), and a custom generic trigger that will cause the nearest cocoon to break open (place this around cocoons to spawn baby spiders when players walk too close.)

This erf also comes with several cocoon varieties, including those with old dead human victims, those with still living animal victims, and those with still living human victims. There is also a cocoon that is a Spider Spawn before they hatch. Passing near it without using Stealth will cause them to hatch... There are two types of Spider Spawn provided here. Both looks the same, but one drops down from the ceiling or treetops, and the other hatches from cocoons. \n\nThe second creatures are Wolfin. Wolfin are men merged with wolves. They are immortal unless the fatal blow is dealt with fire or a weapon made of gold. The Wolfin Masters will often revert to wolf form when damaged, and then back to humanoid form to heal themselves again. They can only do this twice a day. Wolfin and Wolfin Masters are extremely difficult to kill and expert swordsmen, and recommended only for advanced characters. \n\nBoth creatures come with encounter templates. The Wolfin one comes with a few sample gold weapons (Any weapon with \"Gold\" as the first four letters of its tag will work) and you have to place a sound object (also included) in whatever area you want the wolfin to appear in if you want sound effects when they arrive. \n\nWill work with any version, and doesn't require any haks.

Formally of a house called Thaeyalla, Ankara was the first true daughter and only royal survivor of Tae�yel; Matron Mother and Ruler of �the First and the Four� (the First being Thaeyalla, and the four being Thaeyalla, Masq'il'yr, Uusralla, Tucheth.)\n\nAs mentioned above, three other houses were believed to have been destroyed during the wars with Ched Nasad. These Royal Houses were Masq'il'yr, Uusralla and Tucheth. But, as Thaeyalla (being the only ruling house with any remaining royalty) cast the final Bloodspell, (See below) the other three houses swiftly felt its call and joined forces with Thaeyalla in a friendly, yet desperate hope of increasing their chance for survival. \n\nBut the fight across the Underdark, and the Wars against the Nasad had surely taken their toll, not only were the lives of many drow destroyed, but the laws and the wealth of a thousand years were also lost to the fires and trials of retribution. All now looked to Ankara for guidance, and as the last and noblest ruler of House Thaeyalla many believed that Lolth had finally chosen the final path, and that �through her� they would find its wayward trail beyond the walls of darkness; but many still believed that the ancient home of Menzoberrenzan had finally fallen to Nasad, and that the only way forward was in death� \n\nThe Flight of Thaeyalla\n\nAnkara, first daughter of Thaeyalla was born during a time of great upheaval and conflict between her people. But it was at a fateful time when the savage war with Ched Nasad was finally ending that she was to forge her fate as ruler for the remnants of �the First and the Four.� But it would be by the skill of a Mage Lord and the mind of an Illithid - her mother�s two closest advisors that would finally save the day and burn her path to glory� \n\nAnd so, as the final fires of Housewar rained down upon the drow of House Thaeyalla, Masq'il'yr, Uusralla and Tucheth; it was Kalexuss - Illithid Master, and keeper of the Lolths lore that called forth the mighty �Blood-Bond,� an ancient, epic spell that had been placed upon �the First and the Four� by the mighty Lolth herself in her foresight at the founding of all prayer in Menzoberrenzan. Never before had such a spell been invoked. A spell so terrifying that it could level a kingdom within its unholy wake, but Kalexuss knew it�s deadly cost, and knew also that it was the only way to save the last of Lolth�s royal bloodline�\n\nA few moments past before they finally heard the screams. Fell demonic voices mixed with the smoke of burning houses rent the air beyond the walls of House Thaeyalla. Kalexuss lowered his tentacled head as he heard the destruction of the city, almost every single drow, be them friend or foe were dying! Some despotic evil was flaying its hellish way through the burning streets, and like the reapers corn in the field his bloodied scythe was cutting its deadly way before his final harvest!\n\nBut all around him he could hear that the Spell of Blood was working�\n\nSuddenly and out of nowhere, many drow bearing the house insignias of Masq'il'yr, Uusralla and Tucheth began to appear within the Thaeyallan courtyard. Bewildered, blood-spattered and dazed, over ten score drow swiftly began to draw weapons and stare at the battered assemblage about them, when suddenly, Ankara, First-daughter of Tae�yel called them forth to order!\n\n�Hold thy weapons my children! Fear not! For the will of Araushnee is with thee!� Still shocked and bemused, the gathered drow began to listen�\n\n�The swords of Ched Nasad are failing, but the might of their city cannot be assuaged! Only �the First and the Four� have the might and the sight to withstand their will! Be it known that Lolth�s Champion now fights beyond the walls to protect us; our way through the dark has been foreseen� So stand with me now as my children, and I shall call forth the path to victory!� A few expectant cheers rent the gathering, and with an imperious nod of her perfect brow, she signalled for her consort (Lord Phaegen) to begin his only sorcery; and by shaping the energies of the blood spell Lord Phaegen began to call forth a shinning, glistening Portal!\n\nMany of the drow stepped back in utter amazement! For it had been well known to all that the summoning of a portals had been nigh on impossible during the assaults by Ched Nasad, But to Ankara and the gathering drow its glimmering aura brought hope. Hope in the fact that not all was truly lost, and that perhaps the chosen of Lolth could finally save the day for her children!\n\nIt was then that Ankara gradually rose from her mothers throne and spoke to them saying, �Go my eternal children! Flee into the dark and the deep! Stand together as one, or fall before the ruin of us all!� She could see that many of the drow still hesitated, and were afraid�\n\n�Do I see you doubting? Fear not my brethren, for you are the chosen of all Lolths mighty children! As one you must be, and doubt me you must not! And to show you all is well, and that the path be true and clear, it is �I� that shall lead you before the mode!� And pulling forth her sword in a gesture of salute and defiance, Ankara, Queen Matron of the House of Thaeyalla ran down the marble stairs of her throne and leapt beyond the gateway� \n\nThe Founding of Akraaka�char\n\nIn the language of the ancient drow Akraaka�char means �Burning Gift�. It was the place that the exiles of the Menzoberrenzan (or rather those being of �the First and the Four�) had fled to during the final �perceived� hours of its war with Ched Nasad. But the drow that fled that day had no idea that the war had reached a lethal zenith and that the warlords on both sides had stalled their deadly conquest. \n\nAnkara however, was aware of only one thing as she tumbled down the tunnels beyond the magic doorway - her faith. Faith in the power of Lolth, and in the soaring strength its living guidance would bring her. But when Ankara was thrown clear beyond the glittering portal, all she could �feel� was heat! A burning, blistering furnace had suddenly begun to engulf the world around her! And seeing that it threatened to scorch the very flesh from her bones, she quickly began a prayer to ward both her �and� the spinning souls that would surely come behind her. But, just as she was about to complete the final word of guarding the roaring towers of flame suddenly rolled back and were repelled, as if quenched by the touch of some mighty churning wave! Once extinguished, buffeting clouds of sulphurous ash welled up from the stones around her, and then settled to begin oozing this way and that like tiny rivulets of ichor in their efforts to find a drain point. But as they slowly did so gushing steaming plumes of fetid gas and sulphur burst up from beneath the bedrock, the very ground itself was suddenly bursting to life! Throwing rock and muck in all directions, the land began to buck and flail at Ankara madly! Elsewhere time itself had seemed to be standing still, and as the very ground itself took form and molten substance, Ankara could see that strange grottos had begun to form in the basalt; fresh tunnels and troughs had also begun their thrust from the earth like the arms of a monstrous beast, flapping madly in its effort to couple with a some lonely cave or distant outcropping. Suddenly the ground beneath her began to quake and split with anger, and Ankara, unable to stand there any further was thrown to the ground beneath her, and now, filled with an insane desire for self preservation Ankara screamed whilst scrambling for the relative safety of a jagged new rock nearby. Seconds later the ground both ahead and behind her suddenly burst asunder! As two pinnacles of stone thrust upwards, towering toward the heavens, sending a shower of whirling rocks and mineral dust crashing down towards Ankara! \n\nDust and acrid smoke billowed out across the floor still being battered by the various impacts of stone and scattered minerals, and Ankara, almost buried to hip in silt and glowing pumice slowly pulled herself free to survey herself for injuries. When all of a sudden Ankara became acutely aware that the cave itself was slowly becoming brighter, and that everything in general was gradually starting to quieten down. Dust was beginning to settle and the ground no longer shook, but in the distance (some one or two miles away) Ankara�s� keen eyes could faintly make out an eerie red glow that appeared to be extending from the ground, possibly from within a cave mouth or deeply rent depression. She could also make out what appeared to be a curiously funnel-shaped thrust of rock, itself illuminated by the gleams from the nearby fissure. Feeling a little less dazed and confused, but, acutely aware that no one was coming to follow her, Ankara, daughter and Matron of House Thaeyalla slowly rose to her feet, and after brushing away the filth from her robes she began the long and arduous trek towards the gleaming show of rock�\n\nTHE END\n(Well, of my flowery writing anyway�)\n\n\nAnd so, Ankara found the Blood Well� It would seem that Lolth had frozen time within the conduit of the portal allowing just enough time for Ankara to fathom the secrets of the Blood Well. It would also be safe to assume that Ankara would have had ample time to survey the vast network of tunnels, caves, and parapets within the lofty cavern; and after discovering that it was conveniently clean of any and all higher life forms, it appeared to be just about ready for the exiled drow to colonise, All Ankara had to do was figure out what to do next? A relatively simple task for a women of her stature, considering the fact that by the age of puberty she was commanding an army of ten thousand warriors as she fought for glory of her House in the Battles against the enemies of Menzoberrenzan! \n\nIts probably best to note that the Caverns� actual location can be anywhere, but if your campaign is based in Faerun, I suggest that you make its location in the east, perhaps beneath the kingdoms of Kara-tur or Mulhorand. This would limit the possibility of her people encountering the wayward drow of different cities, especially those of Ched Nasad or Menzoberrenzan. Politics and neighbouring trade will also play a major part in limiting these social or extraneous encounters, as both the surface nations of Kara-tur �and� Mulhorand are a little more than preoccupied in keeping their own nations encounters to a minimum.\n\nIt must also be noted that the Blood drow of Akraaka�char are not quite as militant or as hell-bent on conquest as their western or southern counterparts. This is partly due to the persuasive controls of the �Blood Water� (See below) which in turn has also made them less aggressive, and, therefore, more accepting in general of strangers. Whilst this in itself makes the blood drow more approachable, it�s their �All for one, and One for all� mentality that makes an outsiders life around the blood drow a little more tolerable! \n\nSociety, The Blood Well and the Blood Water\n\nOnce Ankara had surveyed the confines of the cavern and had born witness to the mysteries of the Blood Well, Lolth then decided to allow only those that had followed Ankara both loyally and dutifully to enter the confines of the cavern along with her � killing all else that had dared to enter the dark portal prior to the destruction of House Thaeyalla. But, even then, in the beginning, mighty Lolth only permitted the Lords Phaegen, Master Kalexuss and Princess Atraeya to enter the new world with their matron and bear witness to the wonders of Akraaka�char. They appeared nearby to the glowing fissure that Ankara had recently discovered, and upon spying her they could that she had indeed been changed� \n\nUnbeknownst to her Advisors Ankara�s exposure to the source of the Blood Well had indeed forever transformed her permanently, it had granted her a complete mastery over the matter of her form, Eternal youth, and the unquestionable ability to command all she would call her subject, (hence Ankara�s incredibly high Charisma of 50! And her ability to Shapechange her at will.) These gifts however had come at a great price to Ankara. As long as the Blood Well flowed her powers would always be with her, She was to build a great shrine around the wells funnel and channel its waters with tubing in similar fashion to the silken strands of a massive spiders web, allowing its crimson water to extend to every corner of the newly made cavern. This water was to be a gift to all of Lolths children (Ankara�s loyal subjects) granting them extended life, great courage, and the ability to feel love for ones partner without the need for jealousy, mistrust or embarrassment. But Ankara knew that there was more to this liquid than met the eye, and seeing her doubt Lolth indeed told her saying, \n\n�The water is indeed my gift to you Ankara! And when you drink of its molten glory you drink of me! But know that in order for your people to maintain their sacred gifts �it in itself� must be fed! Fed with the blood of your enemies! But fear not! For this is also a gift in part, the gift of sacred Vengeance that I promised you. It will serve you as a constant reminder to your duty! Your duty being to me, and to the people of Menzoberrenzan! For one day you shall return as the Chosen First House of my resolve and will lead my people to victory! Be it known also that if the need is great and our children face great peril, you may call upon the Wells eternal champions, the blessed Blood Pack � for they are masters of the hunt and will bring swift death to all who scorn my holiest of holies. And finally to the one I name to you as Akraaka, his might is the very soul of the Well, and powers are vast and unearthly, think well before you summon him, for if you chose poorly he will demand the swiftest sacrifice, not only from you but from strongest of our people. Farewell, and know that I am with thee, and that I love thee��\n\nThese immortal words have stayed with Ankara throughout her reign as monarch to the blood drow, and never once has her loyalty been broken or the faith in her patron been wavered. She not only admires her children greatly, but also adores her patron deity and would, if tested to the end, immediately give her life for their greater glory. As such, this eternal commitment to Lolths splendour has seen her cities� populace grow beyond reckoning. \n\nThe power of the blood water enriches the daily life of all drow, giving them the strength to fight off adversity and challenge the daily chores of adult drowish life. Ritual now plays a massive part of any blood drow�s existence. Nothing is more sacred than the blood bond to a brother or spouse, except perhaps the blood oath of duty to Ankara, the Queen of the Blood throne herself. It is this oath of friendship (brought on the power of the Blood Water) that has allowed the blood drows� culture to blossom throughout their region of Underdark, and as such has slowly shifted their racial alignment in this region to Lawful evil, with many (especially traders) exhibiting individual Neutral tendencies. Humans and orcs for example, or those that have willingly partaken in the blood oath fight side by side for the benefit of the group, but due to the evil nature of the drow themselves this benefit does not extend toward their many enemies, who they capture with impunity and sacrifice to the blood well if they are unwilling to drink the blood water. All blood brothers of the blood drow treat (even their inferiors) with respect; this respect is in turn returned in kind with either dutiful service or even open gratitude; and on high days the sick are truly healed by the priesthood, or the dead are brought to life if the sacrifice they made for the group was honourable, or to the eventual benefit of all. \n\nThis almost drone-like service to the queen and her followers makes the blood drow a formidable opponent. Even though they possess no hive mind, any slight to a brother of the blood by an outsider will always demand some restitution. Be it an apology, financial restitution or a Blood Duel, either way, to a blood drow, the end will always justify the means, regardless of its final outcome. If such offence affects the royal family or damages drow society as a whole the queen may take a final action by summoning the champions of the blood well in order to punish these foolish perpetrators. But such an action is rarely necessary, as slights are often solved individually, unless it affects the blood drow in general. \n\nAnyway I think that�s about enough from me� Hope you enjoy the fateful Blood drow! Just a few final words on a couple of things I�ve previously but not gone over well enough:\n\nBlood drow Longevity:Due to the power of the blood water an average Blood drow�s lifespan appears to have doubled in length since the earliest inception of the liquid. Humans and other races seem to benefit in every other (vitality, powers etc) way but do not bonuses to their lifespan�\n\nSuggestions:\nChildhood: 1 - 49 years \nAdolescence: 50 - 79 years\nAdulthood: 80 - 279 years\nMiddle Age: 280 - 379 years\nOld: 190 - 380 years\nVenerable: 381+ years\nMaximum Age +6d100 years\n\nThe Blood Oath:A willing oath taken by all who wish to embrace the culture of the blood drow, and always accompanied with great celebration, the consumption of copious amounts of the blood water. Often seen as a rite of passage for the newborn in embracing the wisdom of Lolth.\n\nSuggestions:�Thou shalt not kill thy Blood brother.\nHallowed be the Blood Well��\n\n�Thou shalt not spill the Blood Water.\nHallowed be the Blood Well��\n\n�Thou wilt not stand for one false god!\nBlessed be the Blood Water��\n\nEtc, Etc I think you�ll have fun with this one?! \n\nThe Blood-bonded:Any living being that partaken of the blood oath, and now requires a daily consumption of the Blood water to survive.\n\nThe Blood Water:An Addictive narcotic that issues from the source of the Blood Well. After initial exposure it must be consumed on a daily basis, in a similar fashion to that of normal water. The blood-bonded them selves have no further need for natural water, as the waters of the blood well provide any and all the of liquid sustenance their bodies naturally require. It is often said by the blood-bonded that the blood water tastes of purest cherry, and on high days its flavour subtly changes to that of peaches or finest strawberries!\n\nPackaged Blood water:When the blood-bonded are forced to travel they always take provision of the blood water. But after travelling beyond the confines of Akraaka�char its power to convert outsiders is always completely corrupted, as it requires a nearby connection to the blood well in order to master an outsider to the blood oath. In other words its power to convert the unbeliever will only function from within the mighty walls of Akraaka�char.\n\nSuggestion:A Blood Spring? Works like a magical node or conduit perhaps? But I would say that the ability to make or maintain one would be extremely difficult. As this in itself could pose a threat to freewill within the Underdark, and therefore open up a whole can of worms for everyone! Sounds like fun though!!\n\nThe Blood duel:A sacred contest of physical skill, strength, or will power. Often adjudicated by the priesthood. Blood duels are never called between blood brothers; only against outsiders, whose treachery is often commonplace. Blood duels can sometimes be ceremonial, especially on high days when plays of elder days are often re-enacted (Especially Wars against Ched Nasad, etc.)\n\nThe Crimson Shrine:The Palace of Ankara, and the royal entourage. Also houses the sacred blood well, which is often open to all. It is also a place of contemplation, adjudication or celebration, especially on high days. Blessed be the Blood Water!\n\n\n\n\nAnyway can�t think of anything else to scribble right now! But I�m sure that you�ll come up with loads of stuff on your own.

The first model I encountered on the vault had a red body and a somewhat hydra-like appearance other than having wings. The CCP also had a Tiamat model that was a bit smaller with a black body and the same hydra-like nature but it lacked wings so I began work on a new version. I decided to abandon the hydra type neck structure and give her five evenly spaced heads that are appropriately sized for the individual dragons they come from in comparison to the others present. Also I created new skins especialy for her. She is described as having a brown body in all the updated entries so now she does. I also created a version that has the old striped description. If you look at her you'll see that the stripes are diferent on the right side from the left. (It's a neat little trick I've been using to give a single chest model two entirely diferent skins.) Both the new models have glowing eyes that are the appropriate colors for the eyes on the various heads and the heads themselves match the Bioware dragons. The pic shows a comparison of the previous two Tiamat models to the new style. The new ones are bigger than the older versions and maneuver with a much smoother motion. I also included new portraits for her that feature the Cult of Tiamat preying at her feet. I also have a great many Temple of Tiamat placeables including statues and am looking for some assistance with a matching tileset if anyone is interested in adding one to their mods.\n\nUpdate: I have added my new walking and running animations to these and tested them several times.

(Alternatively, you could merge this into your server's copy of cep2_add_sb_v1.hak, as long as you consider this approach \"unofficial\".)\n\nDemilich_erf.zip is an importable version to be used in conjunction with CEP 2.0 and cep2_bluept_v1.erf. If you unzip this into your erf directory and import the .erf into your module, overwriting the CEP resources, then this demilich will replace the buggy CEP one.\n\nDemilich_nonCEP.zip is an importable version from which all CEP requirements have been stripped. If you don't use CEP, then unzip this into your erf directory and import the .erf into your module to get the creature and associated resources.\n\n\nBuilding:\n\nThere are three major changes with this creature in regards to module builders.\n\nFirst, you can no longer use the Pile of Bones placeable as a resting demilich. (This only applies to newly placed placeables; a Pile of Bones placed under the old CEP system will continue to function even after adding this package to your module.)\n\nSecond, these scripts have much less hardcoding, so you can change some things without editing scripts. In particular, the CEP blueprint name is no longer hardcoded, so you can make custom demiliches that behave like this one. (In fact, there's an example custom demilich included.)\n\nThird, you may want to be sure to give your players access to the CEP Holy Water item, as the demilich's death sequence has been fixed.\n\nAnd a final note: this is not only backwards-compatible with any demiliches currently in your module, but also updates their behavior (and updates their portrait, description, and feats once they retreat to bones) without the need to \"update instances\".\n\n\nPlaying:\n\n* The demilich's Trap the Soul ability now prevents attempts to raise the victim, as was intended.\n\n* The demilich is no longer destroyed merely by killing it, as was intended.\n\n* The demilich no longer shouts.\n\n* Truly destroying the demilich now can cause momentary stunned and dazed effects. I hope these are not detrimental so much as a reflection of just how powerful a force you were messing with.\n\n* Spiffier visual effects are being used.\n\n\nDM-ing:\n\n* The demilich's special death sequence does not fire properly if the demilich is DM-controlled when it is killed. DM's might want to exercise caution.\n\n\nMisc:\n\n* The default demilich feat selection was changed. Weapon feats are now for the creature weapon, rather than the rapier, and Spell Foci have been added since the demilich seemed to have not enough feats given its level.\n\n* Demilich description and portrait changed. (They were the lich versions.)\n\n* The Gem Tooth was given a makeover and intrinsic value, and it is now droppable.\n\n* The Dust Cloud is no longer usable. (It tended to get in the way.)\n\n\nCEP technical notes:\n\n* All of the files included in this were changed, with the exceptions of zep_cre_d10drb.uti, zep_cre_demilh.uti, and zep_inc_scrptdlg.nss.\n\n* The conversation zep_demi_bones is no longer used.\n\n* CEP talk table entries 41052 and 41053 are no longer used.\n\n* I tried to stick with the CEP naming scheme to make it easier should this be accepted as a fix for the CEP demilich.\n\n* This is backwards-compatible. Existing modules will not break if this gets incorporated into a new CEP version (unless the module was depending on the bugs).\n\n\nUpdates:\n\n5/19: Minor update to hide corpses of freed PC soul victims who have logged out, and to store more data accessible in custom death and destruction scripts.\n\n7/6: Gave the Gem Tooth some value. Also added a few safety checks to some scripts.\n\n11/2: Demiliches now retreat to bone placeables when no PC's are in the area.\n\n1/8/08: The conversation with the placeable is now private, which makes sense since nothing is being spoken aloud.\n\n3/26/08: Fixed a bug that occurs if a demilich is set to not destroyable.","Rating":9.92,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"588":{"Title":"SRD 3.5 Angels","Author":"BloodNAshes","Submitted":20070627,"Updated":20070627,"Category":"Outsider (Good)","Race":"Other","Gender":"Other","Description":"3.5 Angels per the SRD with suitable NWN adjustments.

However, this package does not rely on an expensive heartbeat, so it requires less CPU time. (I'm guessing much less, but I haven't clocked it.)\n\nGetting started is simple. Download, unzip, and import into your module. Then wherever you want a corpse to appear, place a zombie, and make sure the heartbeat script for that zombie is tk_zomb_hb. The script will take care of replacing the zombie with a corpse placeable, and the corpse will re-animate to the zombie when enemies approach.\n\nOnce you have the basics, some advanced features can be accessed via local variables on the original creature. (See the comments in the script tk_zomb_inc for details.) These include the ability to specify which placeable to use as the corpse, and which zombie to re-animate as. Plus, if you don't like the placeables, you can simply have the original creature fall over dead until enemies approach. There's also an option to have the zombie corpses respawn after the death of the zombie (which might be useful on persistent worlds).\nNew 11/3: The detection range can now be set to 2.5, 5, or 10 meters. (Previously, it was always 5.)\n\nWhile I was doing this, I figured I would also improve the look of the re-animated zombies. Instead of *poof* appearing, they actually get up from where the corpse was lying.\n____\n\nBy the way, there is nothing about zombies hardcoded into this system (other than the default placeable's appearance). You can use it to make any creature rise from any placeable or dead creature when enemies get close.\n____\n\nThis is my thirteenth Vault submission, it involves zombies, and it was published on Halloween 2007.

Finally to NWN comes...tenser's floating disc!\n\nYes, that single purpose spell from decades of D&D has made it to NWN.\n\nIncluded in this file is almost everything you need to add this spell to your own NWN module or PW:\n - a hak file containing all model files, appearance.2da (from CEP 2.0), spell icon, and scroll icon\n - an erf file containing all of the scripts (fdisc_*), creature blueprint (using the blue disc), and creature item blueprint\n - a readme file with further information (for the spells.2da and tlk entries)\n\nThe hak file contains models/textures for 7 different colored discs (see the screen shot). The spell is set up to use the blue disc, but you can always change it if you want to (Aenea's version of the spell will enable casters to toggle a color, random colors, or alignment-based color). It's a really basic creature model, but exactly what the spell calls for (and it's my first original, non-reskinned creature model).\n\nFor those not using CEP 2.0, the hak also contains the model c_secundus, which I used for the animations (or mostly lack thereof) of the discs.\n\nIf you have an opinion or feedback on this, post it here (with a vote would be nice).\n\nFor those that want to see the ease of use in-game, you can follow this YouTube link.","Rating":9.98,"Votes":29,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"616":{"Title":"Forest Trolls Reworked, Improved Ghouls, Improved Yuan-Ti and Funnelweb Spider (hadronyche infensa) - Repost of original work by diademus","Author":"Cuprius","Submitted":20080629,"Updated":20080711,"Category":"Various","Race":"Various","Gender":"Various","Description":"This is a repost of diademus' Forest Trolls Reworked, Improved Ghouls (a collaborative work with LordofWorms) Improved Yuan-Ti, and Funnelweb Spider (hadronyche infensa), submitted since the original posts were removed from the Vault.

There is also a demo module called KPP_v1_0_Demo_Module.mod included in the zip file (put it into your /modules folder to try it out). Installing the system into your module will give you the ability to easily populate a tavern with bartenders, barmaids, and patrons all pre-scripted to bring life to your drinking establishments. They will interact with each other as well as with PCs. Barmaids walk around serving the patrons and chatting with the bartenders when they aren't busy. Patrons come and go automatically to stay and have a few drinks and chat with each other. Although there are blueprints provided for bouncers, drunks, and hostesses, these three NPCs are only partially integrated and non-functional in KPP v1.0 (their six blueprints can be safely deleted).\n\nThe system is multi-player and PW friendly! It totally shuts down when there are no PCs around so it contributes nothing at all to lag, and it saves your having to write cleanup scripts for your tavern areas. The barmaids are fully capable of servicing PCs and even parties of PCs (one at a time of course). They automatically service anybody sitting in a specially marked \"barstool\" placeable, and also respond to voice commands. Hooking a store to them is as easy as painting one down!!\n\n\nRequirements.\n--------------\nKiller Pub People should work with any expansion pack combination including no expansion packs, but you need to patch your game up to v1.69 or later to use this package.

As a result, these sinister creatures bear a particular hatred for those that dwell there, as if they blame the denizens of the Material Plane for the humility of this exile.\"\n\nAnother demon to add to your choice of beasties, the Nabassu is a great foe that your players probably won't have seen before (at least not in NWN).\nTwo versions are included: the Juvenille Nabassu, CR 7, and the adult version, CR 16. Though the versions are based on the original D&D versions, some tweaks have been made. The Nabassu does still get its Death Gaze and Feed ability, which are both implemented through scripting so that no custom content is required. Note though that I highly recommend you change the adult Nabassu's appearance to \"Abishai: Balck **\" if using the CEP (it currently looks like a gargoyle which doesn't really do it justice, but I wanted to make this non-CEP-friendly).\n\nI have flagged this as requiring HotU, but in actuality the scripting as far as I know only needs the custom AI system from \"X2_INC_SWITCHES\" which should be availible to everyone with a sufficiently high version (I just can't remember which one it is).\n\nThe Nabassu's Abilities:\nAs a demon, the Nabassu gets standard demon traits. It also has some decent melee attacks and a few spells. Most powerful, however, are its ability to kill foes and turn their bodies into ghouls, and its feed ability which strengthens it after eating a victim.\n\nAs the Nabassu is an intelligent creature, the Juvenille version would make a good foe for reasonably low-mid-level PCs (see the Wizards website for ideas) and the adult a good end boss for mid-high PCs (a.k.a Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast). Either way, you can use/reuse/modify this however you want (though a mention would be appreciated if you do use it).","Rating":9.63,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"646":{"Title":"Masters of the Universe Characters","Author":"Chaos_Theocrat","Submitted":20091217,"Updated":20091217,"Category":"ALL","Race":"Various","Gender":"Various","Size":"Various","Description":"Requirements: Nwnv1.69, SoU, and HoTU plus CEPv2.2c3\nAlso Requires: Skeletor Hak Pak, which is included with download\n\nYou'll feel just like a kid again when you play Nwn with these characters, based on the toy lines, comic books, and cartoons that we all knew and we all loved! Almost a complete year was spent on the design of this package.\n\nThis large pack contains all of the following classic Masters of the Universe (He-Man as well as She-Ra) characters for Neverwinter Nights:\n\nBeast Man\nBow\nBuzz-Off\nCatra\nEvil-Lynn\nFaker\nHe-Man\nHordak\nHorde Trooper\nJitsu\nKing Grayskull\nKing Hiss\nKing Randor\nMan-At-Arms\nMan-E-Faces\nMerman\nOrko\nQueen Angella\nQueen Marlena\nRam-Man\nScareglow\nShadow Weaver\nShe-Ra\nShokoti\nSkeletor\nStratos\nTeela\nTella'Na (The Sorceress)\nTrap-Jaw\nTri-Klops\nZodac\n\n16 Warriors of Good and 15 Warriors of Evil... 31 NPCs in this set! Plus, I created both He-Man and She-Ra player characters for Nwn too. Put their .bic files in localvault to use them in a CEP-ready module.\n\nFeel free to use any or all of these characters in your own modules! Just make sure to give me credit for having created them, if you do. Credit for Skeletor goes to St4rscream, who had created the model for him. Import the .erf into your own mod, or check out the included demo mod.\n\nAll character blueprints are located under Module Specific creatures. All armor and accessories are located under Module Specific items.\n\nNotes:\nThe character designs are a mixture of old and new series themes. I came up with the following basic ground rules for creating my MOTU characters for neverwinter nights, to give some basic structure to it all. All characters are level 20 except King Hiss, Hordak, Skeletor, and Shokoti, who are level 40. This is to reflect the powerful nature of those characters as the supreme evils of the classic Masters of the Universe setting. The natural exception is the Sorceress, who is also level 40 since she is the supreme good counterpart to their supreme evil, and Zodac, who is the supreme neutral counterpart to all of them. The Horde Trooper is level 15, since those are the weakest warriors. He-Man is level 20 so that if you play as him, there is room to grow in your experience before being able to take on the big bads, such as Hordak. Since He-Man begins at level 20, I also made She-Ra at that level as well. Rulers, such as Queen Angella, are level 30, since they have more experience than the more common warriors, yet are not as powerful as the supreme characters. That covers all of the level ranges. Also: all of the characters come with weapons and accessories, including more practical items as well. Skeletor's Dark Sword of Power can be changed for his Havok Staff if so desired. The Dark Sword of Power, the Power Sword, and She-Ra's Sword of the Protector are god-level weapons and EXTREMELY powerful indeed. Skeletor's appearance overwrites the Nwn Gypsy Chief's appearance... but, you won't miss the Gypsy Chief. All factions are currently set to Defender; adjust as is necessary.\n\nBonus! She-Ra Voicesets for PCs have been included as an extra. They were made using clips from the show that I found on various websites. They come in Override and Hak Pak versions, both for CEP and Non-CEP.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"647":{"Title":"Monsters","Author":"Seph K","Submitted":20091221,"Updated":20091222,"Category":"ALL","Race":"Various","Gender":"Various","Description":"120+ creatures for your fun, from CR 4 to around 30, though not all places in between.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"648":{"Title":"improved creatures","Author":"baba yaga","Submitted":20091229,"Updated":20130119,"Category":"ALL","Race":"Other","Gender":"Various","Description":"A NOTE TO MODDERS:\nYou can use/ modify all my creatures i release here on my page how you wish and release them.

Segundo a lenda, qualquer mulher que fez sexo dentro de uma igreja com um padre, seria amaldiçoada a se transformar numa Mula sem cabeça.\nNas noites que ela sai, ouve-se seu galope, acompanhado de longos relinchos. Às vezes, parece chorar como se fosse uma pessoa.\nA forma de quebrar o encanto da Mula, pode variar. Há casos onde para evitar que sua amante pegue a maldição, o padre deve excomungá-la antes de celebrar a missa. Também, basta um leve ferimento feito com alfinete ou outro objeto, o importante é que saia sangue, para que o encanto se quebre ou se alguém, com muita coragem, tirar os freios de sua boca, assim, a Mula se transforma outra vez em mulher, ficando livre da maldição que a castiga, ela aparece completamente nua e arrependida pelos seus pecados.\"","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"677":{"Title":"AoD-Anvilhammer","Author":"Grimgolem","Submitted":20110912,"Updated":20110928,"Category":"Giant","Class1":"Other / 40","Challenge Rating":"Various","Level1":"40","AC":"Decent ac.","Race":"Other","NPC":"No","Attacks":"These are but a few of his MANY attacks: Ice Breath, Cone of Frost, Hammer of the Gods, Aura of Fire, Ice, and Lightning.","HD / HP":"My final bosses typicaly have 9999 or somewhere around that mark.","Damage":"Weilds a mighty greatsword named glacia.
