If you are a player directed here for download of a particular hak, you are done.\n\n2: For Builders Using the HAK with the ERF: simply assign the hak to your module (via the standard method found in Module Properties) and save your module. Import the ERF file to the module. Save and close your module, then reopen it. Your list will appear under Placed Effects. \n\nInstall Instructions - OVERRIDE DEVELOPERS\n1: Extract the contents of the rar into a place on your drive where you can find them easily. \n\n2: Copy the entire \"OVERRIDE\" folder into your Override Folder (the one within your My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/Override) \n\n3: THIS IS INTENDED FOR DEVELOPERS ONLY (Folks who wish to add to/modify the FX or to put the loose files into their module's custom haks).\n\nPACKAGE DETAILS AND VERSIONS\n\nCamb's Placed Splatter FX v2.0\nThis package that started this spiral into FX madness includes all sorts of blood, grime and gook, as well as footprints, handprints, claw marks and ground debris textures.\n---------------------- \nVersion History: \n1.0 - Initial Release \n1.1 - Figured out how to use pure alpha channel for Billboard types instead of using black for transparancy - billboards look better (if you have version 1.0, just replace all files with these in your override folder). \n1.2 - Added all different color splatter (brown, green, yellow). \n1.3 - Added both HAK and BUILDER OVERRIDE functionalities.\n1.3.1 - Added ERF which imports blueprints to toolset without the need for override version (thanks for the assistance, GrinningFool!).\n2.0 - Added: blood trails (of all four color as the splat), claw marks (wall and floor), vomit (yum!), debris, dirt and smaller standard splat options.\n---------------------- \n\nCamb's Vines FX v1.2.1\nThis package includes 3 different styles of vines (living, dead and mossy), of small, medium, large and extra large size. Each type/size has a \"hanging\" or \"climbing\" version.\n---------------------- \nVersion History: \n1.0 - Initial Release \n1.1 - Added \"extra large\" sized vines that can more easily stretch the height of most walls. \n1.2 - Added both HAK and BUILDER OVERRIDE functionalities. \n1.2.1 - Added ERF which imports vine blueprints to toolset without the need for override version (thanks for the assistance, GrinningFool!).\n---------------------- \n\nCamb's Elemental FX v1.0\nThis package includes elemental geysers and explosions of all four elements plus positive and negative. Code to explode with the \"explosion\" versions, already equipped with pre-synched sound effects! Also included are any miscellaneous \"elemental\" FX, like the Jacob's Ladder electricity arc.\n---------------------- \nVersion History: \n1.0 - Initial Release \n---------------------- \n\nCamb's Light FX v1.0\nThis package includes any light or light-based FX I have come up with to date. As of the intial release the major feature is the \"forest beams of light\" designed to add a natural touch of \"through the trees\" light to your forest, or any area where a soft beam of light would look good.\n---------------------- \nVersion History: \n1.0 - Initial Release \n---------------------- \n\nCamb's Creature FX v1.0\nThis package includes little creatures like bugs and fish animated to be doing something they....well, should be doing. Adds more life to any environment.\n---------------------- \nVersion History: \n1.0 - Initial Release \n---------------------- \n\n!!!NOTES ON PROJECTIONS AND BILLBOARDS!!! \nPROJECTION TYPES of FX will cast along the ground, and roll with it no matter the shape of the terrain. You can see them in the toolset when building exterior areas, but NOT in interior areas (see screenshots!). Placing them in interior areas is more guesswork than anything, and learning what the textures look like when playing with them in an exterior area. Combining different projections in clumps generally looks good, and adds to the variety/randomness. You cannot rotate projection types of FX (without using the FX editor to create a new FX). \n\nBILLBOARD TYPES of FX will cast along a wall, and you can see them in the toolset in all types of areas. They can also be rotated to face any direction, which is nice. Placing these blood FX over each other will make them darker, but brighter with bloom, if that is the look you are going for. \n\nSOME GROUND TEXTURES (like the grubby worms) ARE BILLBOARDS. This was only done for animated 2D textures (animated textures do not function when assigned to a projection). If you can rotate an FX placed on the ground, it is a billboard. Be aware that these will NOT roll with the ground on exteriors, but will instead remain flat at whatever level you raise them to.\n\nFAQ\nQ: What exactly is a HAK, ERF and OVERRIDE?\nA: HAKs are just a collection of files that are called upon by the game when stored and assigned correctly. They need to be placed in your HAK directory (.../My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/hak) and assigned to a module to work. Once they are assigned to the module (via the Module Properties; this is for module builders to do) you can use the HAKs in both the toolset (after a reload of your module) and playing the game. HAKs don't interfere with any module or game that does not have a particular HAK assigned to it.\n\nERFs are another collection of files, but these are blueprint files. By importing them into a module (File -> Import) you acquire the blueprints of items content developers like myself have made. The type of blueprints in the ERF determine where they land (blueprints for FX, for example, appear under Placed Effects). Note that you must either A) have the HAK assigned to your module or B) have the files for a particular package in your OVERRIDE directory for blueprints to work correctly. It is always recommended that after importing an ERF you take note of what has been imported, save your module, close it, and then reload it. Otherwise you may not see all the blueprints show up, or they may not call upon the correct things. Also note that there are two options for blueprints: one is the ERF method, which many people prefer because after importing blueprints the blueprint files are editable OR you can also put the actual blueprint files in your override directory and reload the toolset (but will not be able to edit those blueprints).\n\nThe OVERRIDE folder is what is used by developers, usually before they are ready to compile the hak or haks for their particular module. If you are experienced in it, the override folder is a wonderful asset. Be forewarned that items in your override folder can disrupt your game by loading things into modules they shouldn't be loaded into, by interrupting the patching process, and some careless overriding can even damage your entire installed game. Only use the override folder if you have taken the time to educate yourself on how it works and what to avoid doing (which is beyond the scope of this Q&A I'm afraid).\n\nQ: Where are the HAK, ERF and OVERRIDE options for each FX? There used to be a seperate file for each type.\nA: Because of the nature of this submission (multiple FX packages under one \"roof\") each .RAR file has all three options. Each option is in it's own labeled folder. The download time for FX is not too heavy, so I viewed this method as the least \"cluttered\" option.\n\nQ: I came here looking for <FX previously in it's own submission>. Where can I find it?\nA: Each entry in the Files section is an entire FX package, labeled accordingly.\n\nQ: What changes should I be expecting if I have an FX package downloaded prior to the \"Factory\"?\nA: Unless the file has changed versions since you last downloaded it, it should be the same setup for the HAK and ERF. I didn't reorganize or rename anything. All your currently placed FX will work without a hiccup, and the blueprint trees are the same. The OVERRIDE folder might have a slightly different setup due to \"standardization\", but all the same files are within the main folder. Just take out the old override and replace it with the new. Note: the blueprints are now easily removed from all override versions, so that you can import via ERF and tweak the blueprints while using the override if you so desire.\n\nQ: I really like <FX name> but I think <idea> would be great. Do you take requests?\nA: Yes, I certainly do! Just be aware that the answer is not automatically a \"yes\", but many of the current FX packages are already requests granted :)\n\nQ: Why isn't the Combat Splatter Pack included in this submission?\nA: The Placed FX Factory is for placed FX files only - those that can be seen and used within the toolset.

Moongates appear in places where moonstones are buried (traditionally, there are eight moongate locations near each of the major cities), and the destination of the travel is based on the phases of Trammel and Felucca, planet Britannia's moons. One moon determines when the moongate will be visible, while the other determines the target moongate. It should be noted that the behavior of blue moongates isn't consistent in games; For example, in Ultima VII, all moongates are constantly visible.\n\nRed - Requires an Orb of the Moons. Only two Orbs are known to exist, one carried by Lord British and the other sent to the Avatar by the gargoyles. Activation allowed for travel to any destination, which was determined by where the Orb was used. These allow the traveller to travel across worlds, most notably between Earth and Britannia. A red moongate was also used to exile Lord Blackthorn to Serpent Isle at the end of Ultima V.\n\nSilver - A rare form of moongate. It allows time travel. The Time Lord was able to create them and they were involved in the pursuit of Minax in Ultima II. It is also possible to create them with the Orb of the Moons, as done in Martian Dreams\n\nBlack - Black Gates allows travel through space and dimensions. They can be produced by electrically charging blackrock. These moongates were needed by Guardian in order to invade other worlds.\n\n(Retrieved from \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moongate\")\n\n\nSpecial thanks:\n\nTo Hellcow, whose Cobweb effects I used as an example to figure out how to package these.\n\nTo MokahTGS who encouraged me to get these on the vault, and for reminding me of the silver and black moongates.\n ","Rating":9.38,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"39":{"Name":"Alternate Body of the Sun VFX","Author":"HS_Tri","Submitted":20071015,"Updated":20071016,"Category":"Spell Effects","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Here is an alternate Body of the Sun VFX which I use.

All the inns look the same. Wouldn't it be nice if an inn named \"The Prancing Pony\" could have a sign with a horse on it? How about if the sign could be attached directly to the side of the building?\n\nIf you re-skin a model, you are stuck with that model. But if your �re-skin' is a VFX, you can use it anywhere.\n\nGortan's Signs includes 207 images (now updated to 211) which look like they were carved into the surface and outlined in black and another full set in white. There are both black and white sets of .SEF files for Placed Effects, as well as three black sets sized to match the only three of Obsidian's sign placeables which won't malfunction if a VFX is attached to them. There are blueprints to match all of the SEF files.\n\nThe add-on HAK includes SEF files & blueprints to match the large sign from Crystal Violet's �Simple Wooden Signposts� pack. I didn't include samples of this in the Demo Module because I didn't want it to be dependent. If you want to use this add-on, it is important for you to remember that I didn't include the models. All I did was to create FX and blueprint files which can be used with them. But you still have to separately download and install the Simple Wooden Signposts HAK. \n\nNEW WITH VERSION 1.1\n\nI have added four new images and replicated them to all the various sub-sections. The new images are: ankh, caduceus, winged scarab, defaced (or blank). I also changed out the old beetle image (which I never liked) for a scarab beetle.\n\nI have also added ground images. They are projections rather than billboards, so they can be used on slightly irregular surfaces.\n\nThe drawback to horizontal images of this type is that the orientation of the image cannot be changed simply by rotating the placeable helper. So I set it up so that you can control the orientation of the image by changing the wording of the Appearance name. The eight cardinal compass points are supported (n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw).\n\nThe add-on for Crystal Violet's Simple Wooden Signpost has been significantly expanded to include a full set of images in the form of wood parquet. Each appears to be formed of cut & fitted sections of rosewood, mahogany, oak and ash. I have also added a demo module, so you can easily see them all.\n\n\nINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS\n\nHAK Version\n\nIf you are a Player, you need the HAK version (and have no use for the Override files).\n\n1: Extract the .HAK file and copy it into to your HAK directory (%USERPROFILE%/My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/hak).\n\n2: If you are a Developer (and want to use the HAK rather than the Override version), then you will also want to import the ERF into your module.\n\n3: If you are using Crystal Violet's \"Simple wooden Signposts\" pack, then download and install my add-on HAK (and ERF, if required).\n\nOVERRIDE Version\n\nOnly Developers might need the Override version (and even then not in all cases).\n\n1: Extract the contents of the ZIP file to some temporary location.\n\n2: Either copy the Gortans_Signs folder into your Override folder (%USERPROFILE%/My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/Override).\n\n3: OR, copy the files inside the folder to your custom HAK.\n\n4: If you are using Crystal Violet's �Simple wooden Signposts� pack, then do the same with the add-on Override files.\n\n\nNAMING CONVENTION\n\nThe effect and blueprint files follow a standard naming convention: ax_fx_sign_X_YZ, where X = sign type and YZ = the two-digit code for the particular image graphic. The baseline will give you black images. Adding a �w� before the X will give you a white image. For example, �ax_fx_sign_w3_be� will give you a white eagle sized & positioned to match Obsidian's tall sign placeable. The ReadMe file contains a full list of images and two-digit codes.\n\nSign Type (Size & Position)\n\n0 = baseline medium size for positioning against walls and such\n0gp = ground projected version\n1 = sized to match the Sign placeable sign\n2 = sized to match the Sign placeable sign (which must be re-sized to 1.28, 1, 0.7)\n3 = sized to match the Sign placeable sign\n4 = sized to match the VV_Sign_Square_big placeable sign (which must be re-sized to 1, 1, 1.3) from Crystal Violet's �Simple wooden Signposts� pack. This version is single-sided and uses the white version (which I thought looked better because of the dark background, though that is debatable if you choose white tinting).\nq1 = sized to match the VV_Sign_Square_big placeable sign (which must be re-sized to 1, 1, 1.256) from Crystal Violet's �Simple wooden Signposts� pack. This is the wood parquet version.\n\nThe ground images use a slightly modified naming convention which includes a compass orientation notation after the sign type and before the suffix. The drawback to horizontal images of this type is that the orientation of the image cannot be changed simply by rotating the placeable helper. The only way to rotate the image is to change the wording of the Appearance name. I set all the blueprints to produce North-oriented images. If you want to rotate them, change the _n_ before the image suffix to the compass heading you want. The eight cardinal compass points are supported (n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw). For example, �ax_fx_sign_w0gp_se_be� will give you a white eagle projected on the ground and facing top towards the South-East. For technical reasons there is only a white version (not a black one) of the ground projections.\n\n\nCREDITS\n\nCamb's Placed FX Factory gave me the idea that signage might be expressed as VFXs rather than by re-skinning models.\n\nCrystal Violet's simple sign model was a perfect addition because it is so adaptable. The sign can be mounted on a single post, between two posts, nailed to a tree or simply hung on a wall.

The purpose of this pack is to provide an easier way to fill non rectangle containers with various substances like water, instead of having to rely on billboards or the exterior texturing tools.The models can be used on their own as well for various props or special effects.\n\n--How to set up for use:\n\n[bom_containerfillers_v10.rar]\nExtract the contents of bom_containerfillers_v10.rar into a temporary working directory.\n\nCopy the contents of placeables_2DA_stub.txt and append them to the end of your module's placeables.2da file.\n\nMove all the .sef, .tga, and .mdb files either into your module/campaign working directory, or add them to your module's hak pack.\n\n\n[bom_cfiller_demomod.rar]\nThis archive contains a one room demo module demonstrating some of the various forms and vfx in use.\n\nExtract this file into your MyDocuments/NWN2/Modules directory.\n\n[bom_cfiller_layouts.rar]\nThis archive contains texture assets showing the uv layouts of all the primitive forms included with this pack.

If you see no picture in the viewpane, turn your camera as you might be looking at the \"knife-edge\" of the VFX.\n5. Under the properties, find the entry named Begin Size. Edit the numbers in this row. Obviously, entering larger numbers will increase the picture's size while lower numbers will reduce it.\n6. Save the VFX (File -> Save) and close the VFX Editor.\n7.

Mix different heads and armor sets for many different looks for each skin!\n\nSimply unzip the Second Skin folder to your override directory, open the toolset, add your second skin visual effect appearance under the properties section (\"ss_\" prefix) and begin experimenting.\n\nHow To Make Your Own Second Skin:\n*This is a real quick process, once you get the hang of it, so don't be intimidated!*\n1.Find image. Paste to photo editor.\n2.Rescale image to 256 pixels max dimension. (512 may be needed for larger models, such as dragons, I was told.)\n3.Save as a .dds image (ss_imagename_d.dds, �d� for �diffuse� image, though I�ve excluded the �_d� notation in most of my own) to your override/Second Skin folder. (Create mip maps is unnecessary as far as I know.)\n4.Create a normal map of image, if desired. (Filters>Map>Normal Map if using Gimp and have Normal Map plug-in installed.) Increasing the scale will affect how pronounced the texture is. There are more in-depth processes, but they are beyond my scope of understanding.\n5.Save as ss_imagename_n.dds to same folder.\n6.Create glow map, if desired. Tutorial, Tutorial (pdf). (Glow maps most probably require cloning various model parts. Unless your models have existing glowmaps, swapping in your new texture won't work. All glow maps I've supplied should be redone if to be used, since I didn't confirm their intended look.)\n7.Save as ss_imagename_i.dds (or �_g�) to same folder.\n8.Create a tint map, if desired. A tint map will override the default tints of your creature, default tints which may interfere/cause non-uniformity with your desired goal. I�ve included a blank white tint map, �ss_white_t.dds�. It allows the true color of your Second Skin. (This might also be possible without the use of a tint map by adding a Game Mode Effect Event in the visual effects editor. See #13.)\n9.Save tint map.\n10.Now that you have all your resources saved to your override folder, open the Visual Effects editor from your Plugins menu.\n11.Open an existing Second Skin .sef file.\n12.Edit the file names of the diffuse/normal/glow/tint according to your new images.\n13.If the file you open does not have an image type already that you need, click Add Event>Game Mode Effect. Click on the newly added event, and in the properties display section below, Click on Game Mode Effect Type and select the one you want. Next, click on \"texture name\" and enter the filename, including �.dds� extension you want.\n14.If you would like to add glowing eyes, Add Event>Particle System. Under properties, click on First Attachment, select ATTACH_EYE_L or _R. Next, click on Definition File, A list of effects should pop up. Type �eye� and a list of eye colors should be narrowed. Repeat process for other eye. \n15.Remove any unwanted Events. (There are some vestigial event(s) from the stoneskin effect in some of my initial works, black box or something like that, which can be removed.)\n16.Test your effect by pressing the play button. It probably won�t look great on the default model, but will give you an idea. If you like to make changes, such as rotating your texture images, do so now (as modifications don�t seem to render after a blueprint using the effect is made, while the toolset remains opened... though I may be wrong). Click �Reload Textures� and Play again.\n17.Save as �ss_effectname� to same folder.\n18.Create a blueprint and assign your effect in the properties section under �Appearance (visual effect)�.\n19.Change the model appearance under the �Armor Set� property category. Hopefully you will find an appearance you like. (Nude models from the vault and full plate armor are often very telling/successful.)\n\nOnce you've found a nice appearance, you can also re-create it as a clothing/armour item with a unique tag and use tag-based equip and un-equip scripts to add/remove your Second Skin effect.\n\nUseful Link to Textures: Link\n\n(Note: Some skins shown in images are not included in this package, as they were chosen 'exclusively' for an upcoming campaign trilogy \"Tamas\")\n\nUPDATE:\nIt has come to my attention that you can also use .tga format in lieu of .dds format.

Unlike Camb or Jonny Ree, I'm not particularly skilled at created new images from scratch, so I have to use what images and tools are available to me inside of NWN2.\n\nTo make a request, reply here or shoot me an email at: anduraga.ms@gmail.com\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nUnlike other installs, there are several ways to install VFXs: Hak, override or through your module directory. I have not provided the hakpack with this download but if you wish to pack the VFXs into a hakpack for distribution with your module, that is fine. Although I would recommend placing them directly into your Module Directory when distributing.\n\nRecommended Way: Extract all files into a your Override folder, preferably in a folder labeled VFXs. This will install the VFXs for ALL MODULES on your computer. Unlike other files (such as 2DAs), VFXs do not cause issues with other modules. When you're ready to distribute your module, make sure you follow the next step.\n\nOther Way: While your module is in directory mode, extract the contents of the folder into your module directory. This will only install it for the module you place the VFXs in. \n\nWhen I deal with VFXs, I have them sitting in my override, but I am aware that some people are against overrides. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\nBelow is a listing of all the VFXs included in this pack:\n\nv1.00\n\nCreature VFX\n~ Ghost Dematerialize (Large, Medium, Small)\n~ Ghost (Large, Medium, Small)\n~ Ilavir's Soul\n~ Shadow Flame Elemental\n\nItem VFXs\n~ Ghost Blade (V1 and V2)\n\nScripted VFXs (See Bottom of Description for More Info)\n~ Aura of Silence\n~ Ghost, Explosion\n~ Heroic Aura\n~ Howl, Daze\n~ Howl, Stun\n~ Rock Fall\n~ Tremor Stomp\n~ Seeker Beam Set*\n\nGeneric\n~ 27 Horizontal Glyphs\n~ 2 Vertical Glyphs\n~ Akachi\n~ Akachi Swirls\n~ Akachi Swirls (Evil)\n~ Amoeba\n~ Arcane Lamp Set (x10)\n~ Ash\n~ Asylum Arcane Circle x2\n~ Asylum Book Writer\n~ Asylum Trap Barrier (Green)\n~ Blight Cloud Area\n~ Blizzard\n~ Bloodflow Set\n~ Bloodfall Set\n~ Burned Earth\n~ Candle (Red and Blue)\n~ Cave Light Beam\n~ Crack Set\n~ Darkness\n~ Fire, Tree\n~ Ghast Stench\n~ God Ray Set\n~ Illusion Barrier\n~ Lens Flare\n~ Lightning Explosion\n~ Lightning Orb\n~ Phaze Tentacles (Made by Chaos Wielder)\n~ Pink Dust\n~ Pollen\n~ Power Generator\n~ Rain, Heavy\n~ Refinery Fire\n~ Sandfall Set\n~ Shadow Arcane Lamp Set\n~ Shadow Portal Set\n~ Shroom, Poisonous\n~ Spellweave\n~ Spirit Trap, Blood V1 & V2\n~ Torch\n~ Tower Beacon Blaze\n~ Tower Bonfire\n~ Yuan-ti Barrier (Orange Barrier)\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n*Scripted VFXs will not work in game unless it is done via scripts. And although the Seeker Beam shows up in the toolset, it will not show up in game. You'll need to script it as a beam from one point to another for it to show in game. The other VFXs are either single shot or meant to be used as spells/feats.","Rating":10,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"63":{"Name":"Improved Arcane Spell Visuals","Author":"DireRabbit","Submitted":20100127,"Updated":20100131,"Category":"Spell Effects","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"This is a set of modifications for arcane spell visuals compiled over several weeks of experimentation.

White is the same color as the OC, orange is kind of like a torch and red is fun for people who are fans of old school infra-vision.

Description\n2. Requirements\n3. Installation\n4. Known Issues\n5. Revision history\n6. Credits\n7. Contact info\n\n1. Description\nThis small pack adds two visual effects to be applied to NPCs or PCs to indicate music and sleeping. The first one applies an effect of floating musical notes over the NPC's head, and the other does the same with floating Zs.\n\nTo apply to an NPC, one way is to choose the appropriate effect (either \"musical\" or \"zzz\") in the \"Appearance (visual effect)\" field of the NPC's properties.\nAnother way is to use the included function script to activate or deactivate the effects from within your own scripts. Also included is a new heartbeat script that you can apply to an NPC to easily control its idle animation, so that you can have the NPC lying prone for sleeping, or playing an instrument for the musical effect. These included scripts have detailed comments inside them, explaining how to use them.\n\nIf I create more visual effects for characters (aside from my quest indicator system), then I'll update this mod to include them.\n\n2. Requirements\nThe visual effects should work with any version of the game. The optional heartbeat script includes a parameter that makes use of a function added in SoZ, but I would guess the rest of it should still work in earlier versions of the game. If not, it would be a simple matter to comment out those particular lines.\n\n3. Installation\nThis is meant to be used by modders, so for the loose file version you should just put the scripts and effect files into your module folder or campaign folder. For the ERF version, just choose the Import menu command from the toolset, and select the ERF. The ERF does not need to be placed anywhere in particular, nor included with your module, and can be discarded after you've imported the materials, if you like.\n\n4. Known Issues\nNone.\n\n5.

Contact & further info\nI can be contacted on the Nexus Network as Tchos, or the Bioware Social Network also as Tchos, or through my gaming blog. Comments will be much more quickly seen if you post them on the Nexus rather than here. It is rather laborious to check for comments on the Vault, and it has no ability to automatically alert me.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"73":{"Name":"Fixed Epic Spells ","Author":"rafaelzimrp","Submitted":20130210,"Updated":20130210,"Category":"Other","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"RANDOM QUOTE: This is my first submission :D\n\nWell, people, this is not exactly a fix, but an enhancement of the original epic spells that appeared in MotB!\nWhat did I do exactly?\n\nWell... I was really pissed with the soundless animations displayed when you cast an epic spell... I mean... It's an EPIC spell after all! It's got it's own conjuring sound and etc etc... Anyways, I added sounds to the animations, timed them properly (The effects do not persist even if the spell ends) and I also created a custom animation for the Epic Gate, since it uses the normal conjuration vfx.\n\nI changed nothing about the Hellball spell, since it's original animation is quite smoothe and everything :)\n\nInstructions on how to install the Epic Gate animations:\n-Open the Neverwinter Nights 2/Data/2da_x2.rar/spells.2da\n(You should use a proper 2da editor, but you can actually use the notepad, if you don't mind the utter chaos you'll find the file)\n-Go to line 636\n-Rename the column ConjVisual0 to sp_hellball_conjure.sef\n-Rename the column CastVisual0 to\nsp_hellball_cast.sef\n-Rename the column ImpactSEF to\nsp_hellball_aoe.sef\n-Save the file and compact it into a 2da_x2.zip\n-Place it into your 2da folder!\n(I think you can also place it into your override folder, but I'm not really sure)\n-That's it folks!\n\nI hope you all enjoy this, I had fun making these!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]}}
