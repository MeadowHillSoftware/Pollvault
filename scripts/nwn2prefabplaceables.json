Noble and King now wear a cloak\n\n*UPDATE*21 NPCs for a Norse Setting ranging from Commoner to King with detailed background:\n*My* Norse come from the Far North-East of the DnD world. Their cultural background is only partially based on Viking cliches so they are not known as seafaring explorers and pillagers but rather rural people that live by fishing, herding and hunting (NOTE: I based them on Barbarians so I had to give them Chaotic-Good Alignment to stay true to game mechanics but it doesn�t seem very fitting to me). On the other hand the Norse are rather fond of travelling and trading due to their natural curiosity and the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors. The Norse are great hunters, be it with bow or spear and the take great pride in their leatherwork. They aren�t much of meatalworkers though so metal armor or weapons are usually traded, as are finer cloths. \nTheir leadership is based on nobility so generally they are led by Kings and Queens, it should be noted however that there are a large number of Norse Kingdoms scattered across the North-East who originated from small tribes. That means that a �King� sometimes rules over no more than some hundred people. \n\nThe Norse are slightly taller than most other humans and broader built. (NOTE: I scaled the X,Y and Z-axis according to that). Their hair color ranges from light brown to dark red, their eyes are usually light green to dark brown. Their favoured colors are red and black which mostly reflects on the Nobility as their hide and leather armor usually retains their natural brownish or greyish color. \n\nThe Norse Warriors prefer axes over swords and don�t use crossbows. They are not known to wear anything more emcumbrant than scale mail, helmets are mostly leather and usually only worn by guards. Norse often wear shields but they are not known to use tower shields.\n\nThe status of a Norse reflects partially in his hairstyle as commoners and young Norse are not allowed to display long hair. Hair is also not usually worn open, which is a privilege of the nobility, but usually as a ponytail or a braid by both genders. Especially those trained to become warriors display longer hair according to their level of training and experience. (NOTE: I tried to actually reflect this on the NPCs and think it worked out well despite the limits the toolset has in that field). The youngest fighters are trained as scouts and are known for a kind of messy hairstyle which allows them to be distinguished from commoners although they are years away from displaying their first pony or braid. Surprisingly enough Norse usually don�t display beards until they reach old age.\n\nThe NPCs range from LvL 1-7. All have Barbarian lvls and also the appropriate ones for the Shaman, Rogue, Bard and Nobles. \n\n\n","Rating":9.38,"Votes":28,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"11":{"Name":"Storytellers Hobbit NPCs","Author":"TheStoryteller01","Submitted":20061027,"Updated":20110801,"Category":"Creatures: NPC","Patch":"1.04","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"****Updated to 1.04 without any changes**** 22 creature and 10 non-magical item BPs.\n \n***Update 1.03***\n\n- Some skins, hair and armor where slightly different tinted \n- Voice sets have been completely changed since a large part in the list is not working.\n- Tags follow now the naming convention and start with a c_\n- BPs open up in this folder: Creatures/Humanoid/Hobbits\n- 5 custom shields,either in plain metal or colorful wood have been added.

They are nearly as tall as Swamp Lizardmen but somehow squat and from a dirty orange color.\n\nStone Lizardmen are the largest of their race. They are strong and bulky and usually heavily armoured. They inhabit the mountainous regions, dwelling in derelict mines and forts and plundering ancient tombs where they find the unusual fine weapons they often carry. They are sometimes accompanied by so called Magma Lizardmen, who are able to breath and throw fire while being immune to most of its damage themselves.\n\nThe regular Lizardfolk from the toolset represent the race of �Swamp Lizardmen� in my classification\n\nEach race has its own scaling scheme based on the environment it lives in(see the comparison picture), in addition the 2 different troop types of each race represent younger(smaller scaled)and older(larger scaled)individuals and each SINGLE BP is differently scaled within these parameters. For each race at least 5 different skin shades have been used, the Magma Lizardman uses an fx_effect. NOTE: The armor pieces are only tintable to about 35% which reflects in the missing variety of shades\n\nAll troops have half HP while characters have max HP. Some have magic weapons or shields. There is no actual armor equipped, AC is calculated appropriate to appearance and included in the natural AC.\n \nCRs are as follows\nSea Lizardmen 0.45 to 3.15 (troops have 1 or 2 HD)\nWood Lizardmen 0.95 to 4.30 (troops have 2 HD)\nDesert Lizardmen 0.95 to 4.45(troops have 2 HD)\nStone Lizardmen 1.55 to 5.10 (troops have 2 or 3 HD)\n \nDISCLAIMER: Caster AI is still bugged, most of the times I tested the casters,they did nothing. The Magma Lizard at least uses its Fire Cone(special ability)\n","Rating":9.43,"Votes":19,"Awards":[]},"27":{"Name":"Masterwork Weapons","Author":"Dorrian","Submitted":20061207,"Updated":20090228,"Category":"Items: Weapons","Patch":"1.13","NWN2Game":"All","Description":".","Rating":9.81,"Votes":28,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"28":{"Name":"Slave Wagon","Author":"den_of_thieves","Submitted":20061208,"Updated":20061209,"Category":"Placeables: Man-Made","Patch":"1.03","Description":"This is a wagon enclosed in iron bars, the perfect gift for that slaver or lion tamer in the family.

Included are 10 Skeletons, 5 Zombies, 3 Minor Lichs, 1 Death Angel, 2 Rusty/Rotten Shields and 5 Rusty/Rotten Weapons. Skeletons, Zombies, Shields and Weapons can be found in the same folders as in the original upload, Minor Lichs and Death Angel can be found in Undead/Custom Undead.\n\nThe Death Angel is a Level 12 undead who's a killer with the scythe and full of death-related special abilities.\n\nI tried hard to include female versions of skeletons and zombies based on the Death Knight BP but there is no female(=slender)skull so gender is not always obvious. The Minor Lichs include 2 female versions because the (in)famous warlocks outfit \"Leather 5\" probably wont look right for all those who decided to .hak the original version.\n\nFor the new BPs level range is 4 to 8 and CRs range from 3.00 to 8.00. There are no magical weapons or equipment (the Minor Liches have been stripped of the stuff their big brother has).\n\nEverything is fully customized including descriptions. Armor is (as usual) part of the BP and calculated as \"natural armor\" in the statistics tab.\n\nI tested everything intensively and have to admit the caster AI is -as usual- very weak. Higher level spells get cast but even a Magical Missile seems to be an inapropriate choice in 8 out of 10 times.\n \n*****Original Release Version 1.04****\n\n61 creature blueprints and 47 item blueprints contained in an .erf file that can be imported into any module.\n\nThe 61 undead blueprints include about 24 Skeletons, 24 Zombies plus characters and some specials. Level range is 1 to 7. CRs have been calculated and range from 0.33 to 5.70 for Skeletons and from 0.50 to 6.60 for Zombies (including characters and specials).\n\nIn addition there are 47 rusty/rotten weapons and shields included. All these are tinted accordingly and include the following penalties: melee weapons -1 to hit/-1 dmg, ranged weapons -2 to hit (there is no dmg penalty possible for ranged weapons OR ammunition ) and finally -1 AC for all shields (yes, a small shield is just for show in that case). This serves the purpose to make armed undead less dangerous and provide weapons that �when made droppable- represent junk equipment that will only be used in very desperate situations. It can also enhance immersion in my opinion to find rusty/rotten stuff in tombs or ruins. Creatures in this package are ONLY equiped with these weapons/shields\n\nThe Undead Adventureres provide a kind of boss monsters and a plot idea: An NPC hires the PCs to search for a missing group of adventurers. It turns out they are not only dead but undead and to �release� their souls the PCs have to kill them. A kind of �soul-token� could be included in the quest as a drop to prove the unfortunate adventurer has been put to rest (Edit: the Undead Ranger is missing in the pictures in case you counted only 60 undead *gg)\n\nThe blueprints open up in Undead/Customized Skeletons, Undead/Customized Zombies, Items/Armor/Rusty Shields, Items/Weapons/Rusty Weapons and Items/Creature items/ (the later includes only the Rotten Giants Club and the Plague Claw)\n\nThe Undead Adventureres, Skeleton Characters and Special Undead all have maxed HPs(included in the CRs) the rest have the usual half HPs. ACs are set in the natural armor tab according to appearance. Localized description for special BPs are included. Spells AI is still bugged. All groups are individually tinted and scaled to provide variation.\n\nThe Icy Skeleton and Scorched Skeleton are a tribute to the original Everquest I played a long time ago.

While I'm not too impressed with how the movie is coming about, I used to read and collect the original Ghost Rider comic book as a kid over 25 years ago. THAT Ghost Rider was a bad-ass, hands down. That's the impression I am attempting to convey with this undead pack of Hellfire Skeletons.\n\nThere are three types of Hellfile Skeletons in this pack - a baseline creature, a warrior version, and a warlock version. The baseline is a 6HD undead creature, the warrior an 11HD undead, and the warlock variant is 1HD undead/6HD warlock. CR adjustments and save bonuses were derived mostly from what info I could find about the skeleton creature from the DnD 3.5 d20 System reference Document ( Link ). All three variants can claw their opponents, doing physical plus fire damage (same as a Fire Mephit plus whatever STR bonuses that may apply). All three variants share the same resistances that the default skeleton in the OC has, with one exception - cold damage immunity has been replaced with fire damage immunity. Makes sense... you're dealing with flaming demonic skeletons here.\n\nNone of the variants wear any type of armor (although the warrior type looks as if it's wearing half-plate). Only one type carries a weapon (warrior variant); the baseline uses claw attacks, and the warlock variant uses Brimstone Blast, but can switch to claw attack if the AI in effect deems it to do so.\n\nA note about the warlock variant - its invocation list has been dumbed down on purpose. The only invocation I wanted it to be able to cast was Brimstone Blast. Being able to do anything else on top of that would make it too powerful in my opinion. Plus I wanted it to have an ability/spell that it could use an unlimited amount of times, without being too powerful - this warlock blast type seemed to fit the bill.\n\nThe visual effect used to make these skeletons look like the Ghost Rider (heh) is fx_creature_onfire.sef - I added a light emitter to that effect so make the appearance look more realistic. This is the exact same light effect found in my 'Light Emitter in Spell effects' pack found on NWVault ( Link ).\n\nPlay around with these, mix and match abilities, etc as you see fit. These should provide a nice little addition to whatever haunted/undead/evil module or PW you may be planning to build in the future. So enjoy ;)\n\nUpdate history:\n\nv2.0 - December 2nd, 2007\n\nAdded a few more variants - Hellfire Necromancer, Hellfire Priest, and Hellfire Death Knight skeletons. The cleric/priest type is rather powerful, wielding a +2 Flail (4HD Undead/8HD Cleric). The Wizard/Necro is about the same level as the sorcerer variant, but this one can also wield a scythe (1HD Undead/8HD Wizard). The Hellfire Death Knight should be avoided at all costs (6HD Undead/10 HD Blackguard/4HD Fighter) - this one is decked out in full Death Knight plate armor and wields a Darksteel Bastard Sword.\n\nThe Hellfire Sorcerer and Warlock variants received a visual overhaul, and fit their roles much more closely.\n\nUpdate to the visual flame effects - all Hellfire skeletons now cast shadows given off by their flaming bodies.\n\nBecause of the additions/changes to this blueprint package, this will only work with the Mask of the Betrayer expansion pack installed.\n\n\nv1.2 - February 10th, 2007\n\nAdded three more variants - Hellfire Fighter, Hellfire Archer, and Hellfire Sorcerer Skeletons. The fighter wields a cold iron scimitar and duskwood large shield, and uses the tattered chainmail appearance type, while the archer wields a duskwood bow and shoots fire arrows. The sorcerer variant is a lot like the warlock type - it's been 'dumbed down' to use only one or two spells that keep it inline with the theme. In this case, the sorcerer variant uses only Burning Hands and Combust. It has no other weapons other than its claws.\n\nI've tweaked all of the Hellfire Skeletons as well, adjusting levels/hit dice/natural AC to keep it closer inline with it's level and abilities. Here's the breakdown:\n\nBaseline Hellfire Skeleton - 6HD undead\nHellfire warlock - 1HD Undead/6HD Warlock\nHellfire Sorcerer - 1HD Undead/6HD Sorcerer\nHellfire Fighter and Archer - 6HD Undead/2HD Fighter\nHellfire Warrior - 6HD Undead/5HD Fighter\n\nYou're gonna notice that the Warrior variant just got a lil more challenging, and the spellcaster types, while having the same amount of hit points, are slightly harder to hit.\n\nAll variants that wield a weapon can also be disarmed if your PC/NPC has the disarm feat.\n\nv1.1 - February 8th, 2007\n\nMade a custom .sef file specifically for this creature, combining elements of fx_creature_onfire and fx_hellhound_eyes, and then modifying them further. End result - Hellfire Skeletons now have flaming orbs in their eye sockets, and the flame that surrounds them is about 10% greater than previously (source: hands). Light emitter for the new .sef package has been toned down a bit from the original release - range is shorter, intensity is 10% less.","Rating":9.25,"Votes":6,"Awards":[]},"45":{"Name":"NWN2 Foliage Pack 2","Author":"Snakebane","Submitted":20070216,"Updated":20080412,"Category":"Placeables: Nature","Patch":"1.04","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"The NWN2 Foliage Pack 2 has been consolidated into the NWN2 Foliage Pack 3 along with the NWN2 Foliage Pack 1.

Created for both neophyte and over-worked designers these fountain placeables and pre-fab placeable groups are ready-to-use, as-is. Both visual effects and magical functionality have been included. Just drop a fountain into your module, set the variables on it (to tell it what to do) and walk away. The suite is fully self-contained and all of its components are unique, so that they won�t over-write anyone else�s files or change any game functionality.\n\nVersion 1.2 does not include any new functionality. All I did was to move the source files into a HAK so that you won't have to use your Override folder.\n\nGortan�s Magical Fountains includes 84 placed effects, 80 VFX placeables, 15 blueprints of fountain placeables, 8 pre-fab placeable groups, 4 custom items, and 1 trigger.\nThe fountain set includes VFXs for twenty fountain styles in both small and medium sizes and for both round and square fountain shapes. Blueprints have been included for VFX-attached invisible placeables for each, as well as for placed effects for each. There are additional placed effects for a larger flowing-water spring and a flowing-water style waterfall. I have also included a complete demonstration module.\n\nThe flowing water VFX�s were created by me from Obsidian inspiration (the guy who invented the lion fountain VFX was a genius) with additional effects (like spraying water and exotic magical effects) tweaked and modified-for-purpose from Sorceress Ashura�s spectacular and highly recommended VFX Pack, which have been turned into custom fountain effects designed to be used in the Special Effect Appearance of a placeable to create a fountain with flowing water.\n\nEvery fountain is pre-scripted to make it a fully functional magical fountain. No scripting is necessary, because all functionality (except for advanced features like on-off switchability, global settings and foreign language support) can be controlled simply by setting variables on the fountain placeable.\n\nWhat can a magic fountain do? It can do any combination of�\n\nGood Things� Healing, Cure Disease, Restoration, Remove Curse, Invisibility, Heroism, Ability Bonus, Magic Vision, Concealment, Haste, Regeneration, Temp Hit Points, Attack Bonus, Armor Class Bonus, Teleportation, Skill Bonus, Spell Resistance Bonus, Save Throw Bonus\n\nBad Things� Damage (acid, etc�), Poison, Disease, Curse, Polymorph, Negative Level, Slow, Daze or Stun, Blindness, Death, Silence\n\nOR Useful Campaign-Type Things� Give or Take XPs, Give or Take Gold, Give or Take Items, Make Journal Entry.\n\nInstallation Instructions:\nBeginning with version 1.2 the installation instructions change, because I've moved over to using a HAK file.\n\n1. Backup your existing Gortan�s Magical Gizmos user settings. If this is the first time you are installing it, then obviously you have nothing to backup. Otherwise, open your module in the NWN2 Toolset and rename the �ax_gizmo_user_settings� script (additionally, I always copy & paste the text into a text doc somewhere safe�better safe than sorry). Close the NWN2 Toolset.\n2. Unzip the contents of the .ZIP file somewhere safe.\n3. Copy the HAK file into your HAK folder. On a Windows PC this will be �%USERPROFILE%\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak�. If you are upgrading a prior version of Gortan�s Magical Gizmos (which used a HAK file), then you will need to over-write the file which is already there. But if not, then you shouldn�t get any warning about over-writing files. However, you will need to remove the old files from your Override folder. If your version of NWN2 is unpatched, then you might have to use the HAK folder in your main program directory.\n4. Open your module in the Toolset and import the .ERF.\n5. If this is a first-time install, then you are done. Otherwise, open-for-editing both new and old user settings scripts. Walk through line-by-line and copy across your old settings into the new script. Then change any new settings to whatever you want. I will try to mark new settings in future upgrades, so they should be easy to spot.\n\nFountain Styles\n0_flowing: The most basic, just normal flowing water and that�s it.\n1_bubbling: The first bubbling effect I did. Arguably not the best.\n2_spraying: A spray of water from the center (Ashura�s). I think of this as the best one for general purposes since it creates a classic fountain look-and-feel. It also malfunctions if directly attached as a special effect appearance to a couple of the square placeables. It works fine with the round ones or as a separate invisible placeable (or placed effect).\n3_stars: Sparkling stars (Ashura�s) that rise to reasonably high altitude.\n4_bub_rise: Large, transparent bubbles (Ashura�s) that rise to reasonably high altitude.\n5_bub_drift: Large, transparent bubbles that drift around near the ground.\n6_acid: Green water with green splashes and transparent bubbles.\n7_fire: Flowing red-yellow liquid with flames (Ashura�s) and red splashes under a black cloud.\n8_purple: Purple liquid under purple & yellow splashes with spiraling purple lights (Ashura�s) rising high overhead. This one is the easiest to see from a distance.\n9_orange: Orange liquid with orange foam under orange & yellow splashes.\n10_doomcloud: Green liquid with yellow splashes under a brown cloud which draws droplets upwards (created from some of Ashura�s elements).\n11_whitehole: Droplets of the flowing water are drawn upwards into a purple portal (Ashura�s).\n12_color_pls: Multi-colored light pulses upwards from the center of flowing water under multi-colored splashes (Ashura�s).\n13_nature: Healthy blue water flows and foams as gold-green stars spiral upwards, and leaves swirl (created from some of Ashura�s elements).\n14_champagne: Pink liquid and foam under a central spray of pink with rising transparent bubbles.\n15_blood: Red liquid and foam under dark red puffs of smoke and red splashes.\n16_energy: Water flowing under white lightning bolts and spinning stars (Ashura�s).\n17_portal: Water flows and pours from a mystic blue portal (Ashura�s) in the center of the fountain.\n18_map: Flowing water with a superimposed world map.\n19_blackhole: A black hole hovers over the center of a flowing fountain and draws its water upwards. I modified Ashura�s black hole so that everything pours inwards.\n\nCredits: I really can�t say too much about Sorceress Ashura�s VFX Pack. It was the inspiration for this. As soon as I saw her VFXs, I wanted to use them for something. I also want to credit Teper�s Vortex, Bubbles, Stars and Stuff VFX Pack. The only reason I haven�t used any of them so far, is that I haven�t started on the teleportals yet. Scripting-wise I would have been lost without the Lexicon and Lilac Soul�s code generator. Even though at this point I use little of LS�s code straight, it is still the foundation for everything I do.

Apart from playing the boss mob he could also be a quest giver or even a companion(!)\n\nThe 6 \"Cursed Pirates\" are inspired by the Flying Dutchman crew from PotC - despise the limitations of the TS I am quite pleased with the result, which is based on Water Genasi heads with glowing blue eyes. They are lvl 4 undead with skeleton properties and extra AC because of all the shells, scales and stuff overgrowing their bodies.\n\nThe 7 undead pirates have glowing red eyes for a more *movielike* effect ;) and include male, female and bony bodies. They are lvl 3 *standard* skeletons with no extra AC.The rusty weapons are borrowed from my other undead pack so in case you use that also it will give *double messages* upon importing.\n\nAll creature blueprints open in the undead directory like in \"Storyteller's Customized Undead\". The subdirectories are \"Cursed Pirates\", \"Undead Pirates\" and \"Ghosts\"\n\nORIGNAL UPLOAD:\n36 NPC blueprints and 6 item blueprints contained in an .erf file which can be imported into any module.\n\nAll NPCs in this pack are fully customized regarding armor, appearance, height/weight, skin tone, equipment, feats, voice sets, and local description. They are named p.e Pirate{Female Human Pirate 01}- the text in {} is only seen in the TS for quick reference, ingame this NPC would simply be labelled as �Pirate�. I tried to get along with as few custom equipment as possible. All NPCs have been extensively tested to make sure they fight as intended. One think, that�s out of my control is the fact that upon spawning in a mod the engine obviously assigns potions to higher lvl NPCs which they randomly use. If you find it weird (as I do!) when a Pirate suddenly puts on barkskin, you�ll have to deal with it via scripts I am afraid. Alignement is set to about 75% evil/ 75% chaotic for pirates and 75% evil/ 75% lawful for Corsairs. The faction however is set to defender by default to make it easier viewing the NPCs in a mod before actually using them.\n\nThe Pirates are all cliché of course. I squeezed out of the TS whatever was possible, the different �naked� appearance of Half Orcs and Dwarfs where a big help in that case and some races have really cool tattoos ^^\n\nAll Pirates are Rogue Swashbucklers by default. Weapon focus/specialisation has been added/swapped to the equipped weapons and two-weapon fighting added where needed . The armor is (as always) directly applied in the armor set tab and calculated as natural AC. The CRs are in most cases slightly reduced due to lack of AC. The Pirate Queen is armed with a custom magic weapon (Katana, Att +1, AC +1,CHA +1). All Pirates (including Ship�s Carpenter and Ship�s Cook) are level 3 except for: First Mate and Steersman (4), Pirate Captain and Pirate Queen (5). \n\nThe Corsairs are inspired by Guild Wars Nightfall and turned out to get a kind of middle/far east look. They are humans statwise but I used appearances from several races. Opposed to Pirates, Corsairs are strictly organized like a military naval force. They are equipped for land battle rather than for entering ships and use their own ships basically as transports and bases of operation. The Corsair NPCs have the following stats (AC only takes armor/shields into account, not any modifications based on dex/skills/etc.):\nBlackbow � level 2 Ranger (Marksman), AC 1, Shortbow (+2 Might), Kukri\nFirethrower � level 3 Ranger (Marksman), AC 1, Shortbow (+2 Might, Fire Arrows), Kukri\nRunner � level 3 Fighter (default), AC 3 (+Shield AC 1), Katana \nShieldbearer - level 3 Fighter (Defendert), AC 2 (+Shield AC 3), Katana, Shortbow\nDervish � level 3 Barbarian (Frenzied Berserker), AC 2, two weapons (mixture of Kukri/Kama)\nBattlepriest � level 4 Cleric (Battle Priest), AC 2, Kukri\nAttendant � level 4 Fighter (default), AC 4, Katana \nInfiltrator � level 5 Monk (default), AC 0, Armed with shuriken and bracers that have built-in blades (check the pic). I didn�t use one of the existing monk gloves because they messed up the appearance I wanted so I gave him 16 STR instead to reflect an actual weapon.\nCaptian � level 5 Figher (default), AC 6, Katana + Kukri\nWeapon focus/specialisation has been added/swapped to the appropriate equipped weapons and two-weapon fighting added where needed. The armor is (as always) directly applied in the armor set tab and calculated as natural AC. Adjustment to the CRs have been made based on equipment. \n\nThe blueprints open up in the following directories:\nPirat NPCs - Humanoids/Pirates\nCorsair NPCs - Humanoids/Corsairs\nWeapons - Weapons/Pirate Weapons\nShields - Armor/Corsair Shields\n\nHope you can put these to good use.\n","Rating":9.42,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"71":{"Name":"Caryatid Column","Author":"vladoshi","Submitted":20070921,"Updated":20070921,"Category":"Creatures: Constructs","Patch":"1.00","Description":"5 scripts, 1 creature, 1 skin item\n\nAll are needed to make it work properly\n\nTurns into a statue when not in combat, de-petrifies when it detects an enemy or is attacked.

There, the barbarian who had spent most of his life in the frozen north had been struck by the rich spices, the never-ending heat, and the vibrant color of the land. When his adventures led him to rescuing an enslaved water genasi, Habrux immediately fell in love with the exotic creature, and she with him, and they were married shortly after the rescue. \n\nDeciding that it was time to hang up his adventuring gear and enjoy the waning years of his life, Habrux retired from the adventuring life.\n\nIn 1235, the largest force of orcs ever assembled on the surface of Toril swept through Faerun in a bloody and seemingly unstoppable rampage. The orcs besieged Waterdeep, and threatened to overrun much of the south of Faerun. \n\nUpon hearing of his homeland's plight, Habrux sought to return to the battlefield and push the marching horde back. Habrux's wife, knowing the battle was a losing one, pled with Habrux to remain in the safety of Calimshan's well-defended walls. Habrux life-long \nhatred of the orcs and an irresistible desire to return to the battlefield, pushed him to ignore his wife, and he returned to his home, joining the forces of Waterdeep in their defense of their now-overwhelmed city.\n\nThere, as a sergeant, Habrux led his men into battle with the ferocity of a man half his age. The battles he won, however, could not turn the unebbing tide of orcs flowing from the northlands. As the story goes, Habrux final stand was in Kryptgarden Forest, where his squad was ambushed by a battallion of orcs tasked with ending Habrux's victories near Waterdeep.\n\nHabrux and his allies fought with savagery, Habrux's axe, empowered by his frenzy, cleaved the advancing orcs into two. Charged by \nthe barbarian's frenzy, the allies rallied and the battletide shifted to the favor of the Waterdhavian defenders. When a squad of orcish archers joined the battle, Habrux was pierced by arrows, but his rage did not end. Indeed, the pain seemed to fuel the fires of his battle frenzy. After an hour of intense battle, it had become obvious that the defenders had won the day, the piles of fallen orcs were used for cover by the allies, and an acre of woodland had been cleared by the ferocity of the siege.\n\nThe orcs, sensing their defeat, retreated. Habrux and his men would have victory, but not without a cost. With the orcs gone, and \nvictory on the horizon, Habrux fell prone; dead from the wounds inflicted by the arrows.\n\nHabrux's victory served to bolster morale in Waterdeep, and eventually the city would win its long war against the orcs. When the war was ended in 1241, Waterdeep's Lords returned Habrux's remains with an honorable contingent to his waiting wife in Calimshan. \n\nUpon seeing her dead husband, arms crossed on the axe that had served him so well in his final stand, it is said that the water genasi widow cried for weeks on end over the corpse. Nothing is known as to what happened to Habrux's widow, or what her name was, but \nCalimshan mystics believed that the Genasi had been so entrenched in despair that she had become one with the axe.\n\nThe axe, newly enchanted with the grief and memory of Habrux's widow, was given as a gift to the Lords of Waterdeep; an apology from Calimshan for joining in the war effort against the orcs at such a late point.\n","Rating":10,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"104":{"Name":"Krondorl's D&D Monsters Compilation","Author":"Krondorl","Submitted":20080626,"Updated":20080812,"Category":"Creatures: Other","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is a compilation of my own additions from old TSR and WotC books and some few others from the vault.\n\nThis work is intended just to ease mod creators' life!

As his father before him, Kalan grew to become a skilled warrior, hunter, and craftsman. After a winter far colder than normal brought Kalan's father, the Noguth's most skilled hunter and provider, to his death bed, the village began to slowly starve. Several months later, on the eve of his wedding day, Kalan, now the new elder of the Noguth, was visited by a group of hunters who offered to aid the village. They agreed to make sure the Noguth would not starve, and asked for nothing in return. Having lived his entire life in the distant reaches of the Great North, Kalan knew nothing of these Malarites and their true intentions, and accepted their offer.\n\nFor the next several years, his people propered and grew fat as the hunters slew great numbers of beasts in the area. Well into the fifth year, however, the number of animals in the area had fallen. Worse yet, people from the village began to disappear monthly. After his wife was kidnapped in the middle of the night, Kalan and some men of his tribe tracked her captors to a camp, and were shocked to recognize their faces as the hunters who had so long aided the Noguth. Kalan's men attacked and succeeded in rescuing his wife before the Malarites called upon the beastlord. The camp became swarmed with winter wolves, and the Noguth retreated to their village for help. The Malarites and their wolves pursued, and a violent battle took over the village. Hours later, Kalan awoke in a pool of his own blood, surrounded by wolves. Seeing the bodies of the Malarites and the Noguth all dead before him, with wolves feasting on their corpses, Kalan realized himself to be the only person to survive the battle. In a fit of rage, Kalan flayed every remaining wolf alive. Even as his mind fell apart in grief, he used their hides to craft this sturdy shield of hard leather and stained it with their blood. He then set out to wander the Great North alone on a suicidal mission of revenge to slaughter every wolf he could find.\n\nHow Kalan's days ended is not entirely certain, but this shield now bears a long scar across it, presumably from the claws of some great beast. As Kalan never travelled without this shield, it now resting in your hands is proof enough that the wolves of the beastlord finally claimed the last of the Noguth. This shield provides you the same protection against winter wolves that it gave Kalan, but also fills you with all of his anger and grief.\n\nProperties:\nBase Item: Heavy Shield\n\nAC Bonus vs. Racial Group: Beast [+2]\nDamage Resistance: Cold [15/-]\nDecreased Ability Score: Wisdom [-2]","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"111":{"Name":"Gremlin's Kobold Prefabs","Author":"Gremlin","Submitted":20080810,"Updated":20081209,"Category":"Creatures: Humanoid","Patch":"1.13","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Due to the lack of Kobold templates and the inaccuracy of the Kobold already in the toolset I sat down and decided to do something about it.

One of these was ruled by Queen Laexa K�zex. The army�s champion, known by the name of Evin T�myt was also her lover and for their 5th anniversary the Queen intended to make him a special present � a shield of immense power. The courts master armorer had worked for more than half a year on this single piece, made of the finest materials available and the skin of one of the ancient spiders that lurked in the deepest corners of the underworld.\n\nThe Queen was troubled however, because of ruomors, that her champion was unfaithful. Of course it could be just another intrigue, started by her enemies but she felt the sting of truth behind the rumors. For weeks she tried to find out who had stolen her lover but she was unable to detect his mistress. But that her lovers mind and body where absent was undeniable so she decided to get rid of him. To avoid losing her face she decided to let one of the eager young knights challenge her champion to a duel and kill him. But Evin T�myt was the most formidable fighter she had ever seen so she had to change the odds. The Queen ordered the master armorer to imbue the shield with a terrible vulnerability for electricity since she knew, that the knight who would challenge her champion owned just the right weapon to take advantage of this.\n\nEverything worked according to her plans, the young knight, pretending to be drunk, challenged T�myt and the champion did of course carry the shield, his Queen had presented him, into the arena. But what K�zex did not know, was that her champions mistress was in fact the master armorer Drisa N�tal who had told her lover about the shields weakness. T�myt had prepared himself with potions and spells for the battle and after the fight went on for several minutes the Queen knew that someone had crossed her plans.

I decided to release these books separately for two reasons, firstly, because they�re quite fun and easy to use, and secondly to bring a bit more attention to the upcoming MMP v1.3 (which will include these books as well as 100+ other items). The reason I decided to make these is that items like this are included in some unrelated CRPG games (e.g. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, Oblivion) and people have always enjoyed them � so why not NWN2 players?\n\nBe forewarned, these items will make a character register as �illegal� on Persistent Worlds that have �Enforce Legal Characters� enabled (which is practically every Persistent World I imagine). Do not use these items on any character you intend to use on a PW, and do not include them in any Persistent World�s loot � if you intend to do so, please backup your Local Vault/Server Vault contents beforehand. The change is irreparable as far as I know, so consider yourselves warned. For these reasons, I recommend only using the items for singleplayer, LAN multiplayer and non-PW or non-legal character enforcing multiplayer purposes.\n\nFeel free to change these items to suit your individual needs, but give proper credit, and as always, please consider providing feedback and voting. E-mail me if you have specific questions.\n\nFinally, thanks goes out to J.O.G, for helping me produce a functional script. Prior to this little project I had done literally no scripting with NWN2, but thanks to his consistent help and solutions, it was a fun experience and a manageable learning curve. Thanks J.O.G!\n\nApep\n\nThe Magical Miscellanea Package (Full Pack): Link\n\nThe Spell Sequencers and Ioun Stones Mini-Pack:\nLink\n\nNOTES\n\n-Included: 18 books (3 for each ability) that permanently boost an ability contingent on their individual strength. The books are numbered Vol. I to Vol. III, and the Roman numeral in each name refers to the actual boost/bonus to the ability (e.g. Flamestaff�s Manual Vol. III increases Intelligence by 3). These boosts mesh fine with other magical items and may be used an unlimited amount of times and in any combination. A single script is also included which fires when the items are activated, granting the appropriate bonus and displaying a text message.\n\n-How to install/use: Using this mini-pack is very easy, you just have to import the items and script into your module. Then you can place them wherever you like within the mod and when you activate them the script will take care of the rest.\n\n-Future updates/inclusions: Only two small changes, firstly the script is going to be tidied up slightly (the switch-case system will be replaced with something simpler) and secondly, I'm going to add more detailed comments, so you guys can understand the script easier and know what you have to change (should you choose to fiddle with it).","Rating":8.75,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"145":{"Name":"Ayrik's Food and Drink","Author":"Ayrik","Submitted":20090829,"Updated":20090830,"Category":"Items: Miscellaneous","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This contains eight items, four foods and four drinks, and two scripts that I put together for fun mostly because I did not like the alcohol effects standard in NWN2.

This is a mini-pack of one use enchanting items that will feature in the upcoming Magical Miscellanea Package 1.4, which is soon to be released on the NWVault (no ETA as yet, but late December/early January seems likely). Just to spice things up a bit and generate more interest in the MMP I�ve always enjoyed releasing my favourite upcoming items separately as mini-packs and the Enchanter�s Kits are the latest.\n\nThe kits allow you to apply a single effect to one item in your inventory or that you have equipped, for example, the Enchanter�s Kit (Haste) allows you apply the Haste effect to whatever item you like in game. The advantage of this is that you don�t need to do much fiddling in the toolset and as with all my releases no additional files are required, you just need to have an up to date version of NWN2 and the official expansions. Obviously alone these kits are not a big release, but they�re fun, easy to use and form but a very small component of the Magical Miscellanea Package.\n\nFeel free to change these items to suit your individual needs, but give proper credit, and as always, please consider providing feedback and voting.

More to come, namely ones which increase attack bonus, AC, massive criticals and the like.\n-Using the items is very, very simple. They just need to be included in your module and when a player uses them they will be able to select an item to apply the magical effect to. There is no way to undo your selection, so consider it carefully beforehand. Please also note that all included items share the same tag for scripting purposes and they all use a single basic script.\n-A little warning, I�m not certain how these items influence the legality of the items they�re applied to.

These items are effectively groups of items that when your character has equipped will yield an attribute bonus specific to your class. There is one set for each base class currently (Storm of Zehir and Mask of the Betrayer base classes included), so the attribute bonus is obviously class specific and the items are also class restricted.\n\nEach item lists all the pieces in the description and the specific bonus is also listed therein. On the whole this is a relatively self-explanatory pack and if you're still confused then I would most readily compare the items here to the sets in Dragon Age, except that characters gain no extra bonus (excluding individual item properties) from having a partial set. This encourages characters pursuing a full set of items, rather than simply getting enough to yield some sort of bonus. The items also possess more common properties (e.g. AC +3, Immunity: Knockdown) that you see on other magical items, so a complete set should compete favourably with a mix of other non-set items. You'll also note that there are no weapons, shields or rings, this is because the script had trouble identifying items in those slots. \n\nThanks goes out to Kaldor Silverwand, Mithdradates, Hoegbo, Knightmare and others who provided input and set me in the right direction.

This means if you want, you can give NPCs set names or specific sets of clothing quite easily.\n\nCurrently, there are two categories of NPCs: �generic� and �fantasy�. The generic category is your standard medieval fare, with various Anglicanized names that were popular in the era (e.g. William Fletcher, Elizabeth Wood) and clothing that suits peasants and merchants. The fantasy category is similar, however it utilizes the random name generation function that you would be familiar with from the character creation process within NWN2, giving you NPC names that would suit practically any fantasy setting, as well as some slightly more suitable clothing that one would expect to see in such a setting. Obviously the generic category is humans only, while the fantasy category has all the non-ECL races.\n\nThanks, please remember to vote, and all feedback is welcome!\n\nQ&A\n\nQ. How do I use this?\nA. Just import the included .erf into your module and drop the NPCs you wish to use into your module (look under �AP� in the creatures tab).\n\nQ. How does this work?\nA. A script is included that runs a check for various local integer variables on an NPC when they are spawned, telling the module what to change about the NPC. For convenience, these variables are called switch variables (e.g. switchvar_names for dynamic names), and can easily be turned on (given a value of 1) or off (given a value of 0) in the properties of the NPCs.\n\nQ. Just how �dynamic� are the various components?\nA. For the generic category, there are over sixty male first names, female first names, and surnames, as well as over twenty sets of clothes per gender and several sound sets per gender, all of which are chosen randomly. For the fantasy category the number of names is essentially unlimited, whilst the clothing and sound set options are similar (read: practically identical) to the generic category.\n\nQ. Can these NPCs walk?\nA. Yes, there are two options for non-waypoint based walking included, please see the instructions for explanations of both. If you plan to use your own waypoints, then all you need to do is follow your usual method, as by default both included methods of walking are disabled.\n\nQ. Why are there multiple NPCs for each category/gender if they�re supposedly dynamic?\nA. Because there are no functions for changing base appearance (e.g. hairstyle, skin tint) and using multiple NPCs allows for further differentiation between individuals. This is also the reason why there are multiple clothing sets with hats, as it reduces repetition in visible hairstyles. In short, it improves the intended effect of this pack.\n\nQ. Do you plan to add to this pack in future?\nA. Hopefully! I�m looking into adding a level adjustment variable, as well as more varied descriptions and possibly titles. Alternatively, if you have an idea, let me know.","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"163":{"Name":"A real Ironfist","Author":"Dragon Slayer","Submitted":20110827,"Updated":20110927,"Category":"Items: Miscellaneous","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"I was tired of the Gauntlet of ironfist not actually being a gauntlet so I decided to use the ACME full metal packet to change it. \n\nto install this you need:\n\n1. this mod Link\n2. to know where your game was installed not the mydocs one usually it is C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\n3. where to install this mod which is here C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Data assuming this is where the install is.\n\n(4. this may work in override but I doubt it.)\n\nthis is not my own mod this is just something I did then uploaded to the vault =D.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"164":{"Name":"Ultimate Silver Sword","Author":"Dragon Slayer & Kevl's","Submitted":20110907,"Updated":20120807,"Category":"Items: Weapons","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"I liked the abilities from both silver swords so I contacted KevL's and we set to work combining them and after a while V1 is now ready for the community please enjoy this override and leave comments (and votes)if you notice any bugs post them below for me to take a look at.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"165":{"Name":"Bonus Blueprints","Author":"shaezyra","Submitted":20111008,"Updated":20111017,"Category":"Items: Miscellaneous","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This expansion to SoZ will add 1,459 blueprints, 902 icons, and 296 scripts to your toolset.
