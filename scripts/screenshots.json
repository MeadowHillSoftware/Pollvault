I was born as a collection of fir trees that I made for my rocky mountains, but the package has now a wider scope as it will gather all the placeables that I'll keep modeling to offer a better range of choices to module builders.\n\nThe current update starts addressing the severe lack of good statue models both in standard resources and custom content. I have created 50 new high detailed statues using as starting material some of the best creatures available, in most cases made by DLA for Bioware. As you can see, I froze them in some interesting animation frames, and created new textures to turn them into various stone materials, making sure that the main details were preserved in the conversion.\n\nWith future updates and expansions of this package I'll include both new statue models and accessories (stand-alone pedestals for example) to enrich the range of options, and additional environmental objects with special regard to work in synergy with the best standard and custom tilesets available for this wonderful game. I'll try to maintain high quality standards, as I strongly believe that a new era could begin for Neverwinter Nights, following the example of the new excellent material that is being added with the final patch 1.69\nRequests and suggestions are most welcome, as I should be able to squeeze at least part of them into my workflow, so in a reasonable time they would be turned into actual game content.","Rating":"N/A","Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"292":{"Title":"Thunder Bowl","Author":"Dave Crowell","Submitted":20080126,"Updated":20080126,"Category":"Module","Type":"Concept","Description":"Jack is wondering, \"What could this be??\"\n\nJack and the Beanstalk","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"293":{"Title":"improved Yuanti-abominations","Author":"diademus","Submitted":20080128,"Updated":20080129,"Category":"Custom Content","Type":"Action","Description":"already submitted guys. no point in making these news public. thanks!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"294":{"Title":"A Few Heads","Author":"Paganini","Submitted":20080204,"Updated":20080206,"Category":"Custom Content","Type":"Other","Description":"Here are a few heads I've made, these will be included in the human head pack I am working on releasing.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"295":{"Title":"Handle with care, fragile crystal spider statues inside","Author":"lord rosenkrantz","Submitted":20080207,"Updated":20080207,"Category":"Custom Content","Type":"Other","Forums":"Link","Description":"As I was working on expanding the stone statues pack with more creatures, I thought that spiders would be a rather interesting addition, especially given the number of Underdark and Drow fans out there.

By default, characters �subdued� by another character are simply unconscious for nearly 3 minutes, with movement penalties for a few minutes afterwards.\n\nBecause I love solo play, many of the quests, especially the low-level ones are designed to be done by either a party *or* a resourceful solo player. However, class, race and skill considerations certainly come into play. The quests themselves possess an inherent amount of variability due to skill checks and the random nature of traps, encounters and treasures to be found � you also don�t find yourself asking why your character is doing the quest for the nth time.

I remember someone warning me away from trading with him when I first arrived on the island.\n\n\"He'll rob you blind, or worse.\" they said.\n\nI didn't know what \"worse\" was until I came in one day and saw a young boy shivering in the corner of the tent, tended to by...well, whatever she was to the lizard. Brown skin, fine features. Never saw any clothes on her. Never complained about it either. Word around the island was she originally arrived as a scholar of some merit. She, like a lot of folks, had come to Procella because of the Stone Circle and The Invited, guests of the Brotherhood of Unassociated Mages from places I don't care to know.\n\nBut she fell in with Agatzi and thanks to the black tar he kept his hookah, she didn't fall out.\n\nThe boy? I don't know. Maybe a trade? He had a bad habit of growing bruises but what was I going to do? Every time I visited- those wild eyes of a frightened child. The bright blue chips of light in that dirty and sometimes bloody face of his. And his hair, sticky and matted with what I hoped was mud. Always huddled in the corner farthest from Agatzi.\n\nAnd then I visited one day and the kid was gone. And she was passed out, as usual, sleeping it off and moaning from some drugged nightmare. For the first and only time I saw she had bruises. \n\nAround her wrists. \n\nMaybe he traded or sold the kid to someone who'd take care of him- what do I know? Maybe.\n\nBut there Agatzi was, and there she was, and there I was and, as always, there was the hookah. On the floor where she could get to it.\n\n\"Ssssssssmoke?\" he invited.\n\n\"Business today. Maybe some other time.\" I lied.","Rating":8,"Awards":[]},"407":{"Title":"Vertical Vista","Author":"Inayity","Submitted":20090505,"Updated":20090506,"Category":"Contest - Spring 2009","Type":"Concept","Description":"I really enjoyed the Castle Rural, Exterior tileset in 1.69.

Each of these regions will be highlighted individually over the next three days. We are showing just a few highlighted areas in each region [you want to be surprised dont you?] We have worked hard to create immersive environments that hope to demonstrate the abilities of the NWN2 toolset through creative design and use of the placeables and tools provided.

A species of progress. Beings of perpetual struggle, and proud of it. When they conquered the land, they aimed for the skies. When they conquered the skies, they reached for the stars. For mankind, the Tower of Babel is never finished. And yet, it cannot stand forever.\nAfter a long existence of division and war, the late 2100's heralded an event that shaped mankind's progress to a new direction. The discovery of magic, mankind's power to shape the forces of the world around them, and a power that would shape mankind itself. Magic would end the physical weakness of the human body, curing the harshes diseases and the deepest wounds. War between nations for energy and resources had become obsolete. The United Nations, once a cruel battleground of diplomatic war, had become an organization of common interest. Of peace. Of progress.\nNo dynasty is immortal. In 2497, the seeds of mankind's insurrection were sown. Creatures of legend appeared on the Earth mankind had thought conquered, ambushing the unprepared species. In panic, the United Nations organized the armies of the world against this new threat, but war had become alien to mankind. These new combatants, the Mythans, were winning.\nIn 2517, the last nation to be untouched by the Mythans, the United States of America, lay threatened. A call for heroes was made to defend its fallen Southern border. Many answered, among them the famed Valor Legion. A group which you, Alex Meda, call your family...\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n-Unique Setting: Welcome to the Dyarodian Era, a rare urban-fantasy universe where magic and monsters exist in our own world.\n\n-Visceral Story: Unravel the beginnings of a modern conspiracy in a cinematic adventure.\n\n-All Out War: Cut your way through one of the largest battles to ever be rendered in the Aurora Engine, optimized to not annihilate your notebook computer.\n\n-Tactical Choices: Every secondary objective you accomplish affects the main battle. Complete them all for a mythical slaughterfest. Ignore them for the ultimate challenge!\n\n-Communicative AI: Soldiers bark orders and call for help when in trouble. You will actually see NPCs run behind cover or switch targets when told to do so.\n\n-Modern/Medieval Weapons: Pummel your enemies with AK-47 rounds, then whip out a longsword for the finishing blow!\n\n-Devastating Weapon Effects: Even the odds with electrifying Shockpunch Katars, exploding Magnesium Arrows and a mighty shotgun-turned-railgun. See how tough that dragon looks after a direct hit from a LAW rocket!\n\n-Tactical Environment: Take cover behind sandbags, abandoned vehicles and large crates. Lob a grenade at a cluster of fuel barrels for the ultimate fireworks show.\n\n-Hidden Cheat Codes: Decode secret messages through the game and enhance your next playthrough with godlike powers! No console commands needed.\n\n-100% Custom Soundtrack: ill nino, Tool, Nonpoint, P.O.D. and more!","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"436":{"Title":"Companions of the Hall in Night of a Thousand Zombies","Author":"Kenneth J.

So in the meanwhile, catch up and take a stab at Into the Darkness. Thanks everyone.\n\n -Kenneth J.

It commences post \"SURVIVAL\" after an unseen encounter with the Daleks, opening with the newly regenerated Doctor arriving on the forest world of Sythera and meeting a new companion, Velpa Lepta - who is, naturally, a feral, busty, alien, stripy Weird Homicidal Beast Girl like PHoD always has. Makes quite a change from Sarah Jane and Tegan... even Leela was harmless by comparison.\n\nThe first Module \"PLANET of FEAR\" is more or less finished (just needs polishing) and the second \"CURSE of MANDRAGORA\" is well underway with the Mandragora Helix environment and Pure Energy Creatures complete...\n\nObviously, the TARDIS was necessary before any adventure could get off the ground and so, being highly irresponsible, PHoD started hitting delicate Gallifreyan artefacts with big bricks and this is the result so far...\n\nThis is a WORK IN PROGRESS and is, so far, far from perfect. In fact, one or two elements are a seething pile of pants as yet. Assuming there's anyone else on the Vault sufficiently interested in \"Doctor Who\" to care, the purpose of these Screenshots is just to stimulate debate, provoke comment and/or sufficiently enrage someone brilliant at 3d Modelling for them to improve upon my pants TARDIS or, better still, MAKE ME A DALEK! So...\n\nImages 01, 03, 05 and 08, as you can see, show the Exterior Plasmic Shell of the TARDIS (or Blue Box as new companion Velpa insists upon calling it). Due to the Doctor's TARDIS having a shoddy Chameleon Circuit, instead of blending into its background perfectly so that I could JUST USE ANY OLD PLACEABLE, no, it keeps materializing in the likeness of a Police Telephone Box...\nMy initial efforts to take the unwieldy panels of the full-size TARDIS prop and cram them into a flatbed scanner were pathetically ambitious though provided much amusement for my dog who just smiled wryly and wagged her tail as if to say \"Idiot\". Attempts to photograph said panels didn't help much either due to certain lighting problems and a week long rainstorm. But, the textures were finally achieved. Only real \"problem\" with the texture is that it is perhaps just a tad too BLUE, though that's easily altered. On the other hand, I'm not sure I don't like it that way as it makes the TARDIS stand out as an obvious alien object pretty much everywhere it lands.\nThe model is bug-free and fine... it's just not quite all one solid object. It is composed of four cubes plus a cylinder, all pretty straightforward, and works excellently that way for a more detailed texture - you can actually read that notice on the door in game! But, it makes scripting materializations more long winded than I'd like and so forth. Working on this at present although, it's suprising how well it works even as it is under 99% of circumstances. It's that other 1% that's annoying.\n\nImage 02 shows the TARDIS Console Room. I've allowed myself a certain degree of artistic liberty but it's generally intended to look like the version introduced in \"The FIVE DOCTORS\". (At least, it's a shot of that version on the custom Loadscreen). As you will immediately observe, the Console itself has a single major flaw. It's completely RUBBISH! The Placeables serving as the Console currently are on the pants side but are merely intended as a Placeholder until I can hit more things with even bigger bricks and make something a bit more like the original. (The hatstand's done though!)\nThe TARDIS Interior Tileset is very simple, consisting of basic rooms and corridors. The TARDIS wall texture is simple but reasonably effective. Could be improved, might actually get round to it some time. (Note the \"circuit lines\" across walls, floor and ceiling - one of my artistic liberties). But... the TARDIS Tileset is more than JUST the Console Room and endless corridors...\n\nImages 04 and 09 show the TARDIS Cloisters terrain. The appearance is based on the way they looked in \"LOGOPOLIS\" with ivy on everything in sight and the familiar TARDIS wall roundels set in mossy old stone. The one problem here is that I'm currently using a Placeable ceiling with the basic TARDIS texture on it and so the Cloisters get the same ceiling, which doesn't match the stone. I'll either do small 1, 2 and 4 Tile ceiling Placeables for Cloisters areas OR just put ceilings into the Tile models directly which would be better in most respects. (Cloisters also have a weirdo Console-esque thing with green light beam for the Doctor to stare blankly at as he wonders what the hell it is - when I figure out what it is and why I did it, I'll let him know).\n\nImage 07 shows another of the Tileset's terrains. The Interior of the Master's TARDIS as it appeared in \"The KING'S DEMONS\" etc. Basically it's exactly the same as the Doctor's TARDIS, only it's painted black to show how evil and bearded the Master is. I found my weirdo circuit lines came out rather nicely in the black version. Hadn't got the ceiling Placeable done for the Master's TARDIS when I did these images but it's on now and looks better. The poor old Master hasn't got a Console yet as I'm waiting until I've got one that isn't PANTS before I do him a black version. It seemed obvious to add the Master's TARDIS interior to the Tileset since the Master was inevitably going to turn up in the Modules in order to be sinister, fiendish and bearded, as is his habit. (The Exterior of the Master's TARDIS changes, since his Chameleon Circuit actually works; I thus haven't done an Exterior Placeable. It seemed to show a curious preference for looking like a Doric Column so I'm using a suitable Pillar more often than not). (As of writing this drivel, I'm just starting on textures for the Rani's TARDIS which will be considerably different to the Doctor's and Master's since her TARDIS is a much more advanced type. Might even have embryo Dinosaurs in jars which she seems to consider mandatory).\n\nImage 05 - The Return of the Mara... Just as daftly PINK as it was in \"KINDA\" but it gets to do far nastier things than just hiss at mirrors this time. As well of lots of entirely new beasts, The Mara is just one of a number of \"Doctor Who\" Monsters to already either be in the Modules or be sitting around waiting to be added to Modules yet to be made, including the Sea Devils, the Wirrn, the Mandragora Helix and others... but, whilst hitting things with bricks and turning out enormous pink snakes is one thing, complex 3d digital modelling is another... In other words, I NEED DALEKS!\n\nThe bitter irony is that, rather ridiculously, I have no less than fourteen full size Daleks in my collection, most cast from moulds taken from original props, including the Special Weapons Dalek and I've built two entirely new types of Dalek not seen in the series - yet creating a squitty little digital version is COMPLETELY BEYOND ME! If I could just make one out of fibreglass and then jam it in through my computer's USB port...\nTried that. Doesn't work.\nDog now thinks I'm more than just an idiot.\nAnyway, if anyone has a NWN1-ready Dalek, pppplllleeeeaaaasssseeee send me one! I'll happily do every conceivable colour version you could texture it with and everything... but I know I'm not going to be able to make a digital Dalek myself... \"help\", he squeaked plaintively...\n\nAnyway, the TARDIS is more or less up and running and, if and when it ceases to be PANTS, I'll get it on the Vault, assuming anyone wants it (unless someone more adept does a better one).\n\nUPDATE:-\n--------------------\n\nThe DALEKS have arrived!\n\nALL credit for the basic Dalek model goes to Henesua who created a new custom model based upon the original 1960s casings. Thanks also to Rolo Kipp for getting it into NWN format. PLUSH HYENA of DOOM humbly just did tweaking, added details, did all the retexturing and made the augmented Variant Daleks by hitting them with bricks in his approved way.\n\nThree Modules of the planned twenty, \"Planet of Fear\", \"Curse of Mandragora\" and \"The Paradise Factor\" now complete, save polishing and altering details as I continue to perfect the CC, and the fourth, \"Retribution of the Daleks\" underway.\n\nMy K-9 model is starting to look reasonable, the new TARDIS Console is more or less done, the TARDIS Exterior Placeable is now a single Model with all issues sorted out. Various old (and new) Monsters done. The Rani's TARDIS is coming together reasonably now and I've chosen the head model for the second Doctor who'll be featuring in the Modules post regeneration story... and who will come as something of a surprise, I suspect...\n\nMeanwhile, here are some Dalek pictures to ogle.\n\nDavros (doesn't quite) appear by way of PHoD's making an NWN version of the \"Remembrance...\" spherical, so-called Emperor Dalek shell Davros was last seen hiding in. PHoD mostly did this as a completely custom Davros model was a damn sight more difficult to build than just whacking a big blob on a Dalek skirt section.\n\nAs well as the first look at the nearly finished Reworked Console, the \"TARDIS Captured\" screenshot shows the all-new Heavy Assault Dalek created by PLUSH HYENA of DOOM by means of - wait for it - hitting a Dalek model with bricks and haphazardly nailing outrageously huge cannons and things on it. It came out reasonably well given my rubbish abilities.\n\nMore updates as events warrant... Still hope to start getting the Modules out this year, assuming I'm not hideously attacked the Legendary Depraved Flying Pilious Gobbing Abusive Ferret of Bednibot...","Rating":10,"Awards":[]}}
