The lands know to the old world are blanketted in persistent winter. Those who survived the impact in the old world banded together and sent out an expadition into the crater left by the asteroid to assess what was there. The leader of the expadition was Daarnin, who subsiquently went missing after the chaos crystals were found in the crater. After the discovery of the Chaos Crystals, those on the expadition noticed they felt empowered in various ways. Also while on the expadition, the existance of two new nations on two previously unknown land masses became aparent. The two other nations (House Ineo of Silvaterra and the Liberius Legion of Incendia) also found the chaos crystals and met the expadition in the crater. Naturally, the Legion chased the expadition back to Divenium as the power of the crystals was aparent to them as well. While that was happening, House Ineo took this oppertunity to begin to take the chaos crystals for themselves. The Liberius Legion became aware of this and started an attack on House Ineo territory south of the crater. Upon the remnants of the expadition from Divenium returning they told of the power of the crystals and Winterfall was officially founded in order to fully pull the nation together. Zarieth was then negotiated with to be the defender of the entrance to Divenium from the crater. The other two nations followed suit and the war for the crystals was on. Over a period of eight years, large groups of people were cast out of each nation and are reffered to as Outcasts. These are a collection of people who were near the outskirts of each nation nearest to the crater which absorbed some of the energies of the asteroids impact. They were subsiquently cast out of each nation due to their \"mutations\". Subsiquently any and all persons banished by each nation are sent to the crater to await their fate at the hands of the creatures. The outcasts banded together generally to form a non centralized tribal society. They are not a nation unto themselves, but may gain that later on in the story told through the expansions. Until then they are the bastards of each nation and are kill on site to everyone, even themselves (they have no reputation mind you, lawless nomads effectively). \n\nEach nation has its own look and feel as well as history and agenda's. \n\nFeatures of this expansion/revamping are: \n\nNation vs. Nation based PvP: \nPlayers of each nation square off against each other to conquer territory. Upon character creation, players select what nation their character will join. \n\nRaids: \nEach Nation has a treasury that other nations may attempt to raid to steal vital resources the nation through randomized automated vault raids.\n\nNations are Dynamic: \nThe Nation leader or Co-Leader may upgrade the troops in each territory owned by the nation, increase their level of training, pay the upkeep on their troops (done automatically if the nation has enough money), etc. to ensure their nations and its people stay safe. \n\nBounty Hunters: \nPlayers may take on the roll of a Bounty Hunter to hunt the enemies of different nations for Reputation, Gold, and the experience of the hunt. \nCompletely Randomized Loot: \nLoot is randomly generated based on the CR of the mob that dropped it and is reminecent of Guild Wars/Diablo 2 style naming conventions. \n\nLook: \nEach region (Silvaterra, Incendia, Divenium, and Daarnin's Crater) each have a unique geography. \n\nNation Histories: \nEach nation has a distinct and unique history that will help mold the quests and agenda's of the Nation. \n\nReputation: \nPlayers through their actions will gain or lose reputation with each of the nations. Reputation is used to determine the Characters rank, access to nation items, and other assorted things (Quests, buffs, etc.) \n\nChaos Crystals: \nNations compete for control of each of the nine Chaos Crystals in Daarnin's Crater. These crystals provide constant enhancements to characters of the nation that controls each particular crystal. These enhancements are random and are set each time the server starts. \n\nLoot: \nAll loot is customly generated upon mob spawn. Thanks to Utimagus, there are millions of possible loot spawns. All with the posibility of having a prefix noun and suffix. \n\nCrafting: \nJust added!!! You are now able to tear off prefixes suffixes and nouns off an item, and then place that onto another item. \"Simply Amazing\" as our testers called it. \n\nVampire and Vampire Hunters: Players are able to complete one of two quest lines to become either a vampire or vampire hunter. Both come with different perks and detriments. Vampires naturally must feed on either monters or players. If players are bitten, they will become vampires if they do not cure themselves in time.\n\nTransitionless Area: Ever find it odd that you run to a set point to get to another area that seems to defeat the point of immersion? So did we, so we got rid of them all. The world is now seemless as you run from one area to another without the constrictions of AT's.\n\nThis is just a rough run down of the server.

It is a chaotic and wild city on the frontier of civilization in the Moonsea. Swathes of the city are still controlled by bands of monsters. A great temple to Tyr, the Waiting, tries to guide the city forward spiritually as it contends with the burgeoning power of the local priests of Bane.\n\nPhlan itself is governed by a loose Council under the guidance of a mayor. Politics are rife with secret deals and betrayals as various forces good or sinister vie to control the future destiny of Phlan.\n\nInto this mix come many adventurers eager to make a name for themselves. They'll have the option to battle monsters while reclaiming lost sections of Phlan, or they can enter politics and navigate the treacherous waters of Phlan's ruling class. Any path is possible for those with the strength to pursue it in Tales of the Moonsea.
