For NWN2 he mentions that the development is coming along great, and about the large amount of work that went into the toolset.

The battle shown here is between a company of dwarves and a larger company of orcs. The features of the AI demonstrated in this video are the following:\n\n Soldiers falling in formation at the start of the game\n\n Units marching (somewhat sporadically) in formation\n\n Each squad fighting as a (mostly) coordinated unit\n\n Soldiers becoming frightened and running off the map when they fail their morale check\n\nThere is still quite a bit of work to be done with this AI routine. For example, I have not implemented any fancy maneuvers such as flanking. In addition, I haven't coded any routine for unit commanders to try to rally their troops. Also, the in-game frame rate when there are too many soldiers in the area is bad. I'll have to figure out what the maximum number of NPCs should be to maintain a minimum frame rate of, say, 15 per second. Nevertheless, the video demonstrates what is possible with the NWN2 engine.\n\nMusic Credits\n\"Sarcophagus Unsealed\" by Troy Sterling Nies\n\"Battle 2\" by Steven Kelly\n\nDisclaimer: The images shown in this page were not taken from the video.

Set in the infamous Forgotten Realms city of Westgate, players find themselves in possession of a powerful but cursed treasure that threatens to destroy them. Linked to the underworld organization known as the Night Masks, the treasure will draw players into a city-spanning clash between warring factions.\n\nPlayers must choose their allegiance in order to break the curse and ultimately uncover a plot that threatens Westgate itself. From the creators of the critically-acclaimed Neverwinter Nights module, Darkness over Daggerford, Neverwinter Nights 2: Mysteries of Westgate will feature a non-linear, open-ended single-player campaign with numerous side quests covering more than 15 hours of game play. Atari�s new Adventure Pack will also feature 3 new companions; an entirely new underground sewers tile set themed after the seedy underbelly of Westgate; a host of new monsters to do battle with, including some truly epic foes; an exciting new and original musical score; as well as thousands of new lines of professionally recorded dialogue.","Rating":7.16,"Votes":18,"Awards":[]},"142":{"Name":"NWN2: Storm of Zehir Video Interview","Author":"GameTrailers.com","Submitted":20080719,"Updated":20080719,"Category":"Interviews","Format":"Various","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Thanks to TheHawk for pointing out a video interview with Obsidian PR Producer, Matthew Rorie on GameTrailers.com all about the upcoming NWN2: Storm of Zehir expansion pack. The video features Matthew talking about the expansion and showing some footage including the new overland map system. I actually got to see a very early prototype of it during one of my trips to Obsidian and it's really cool. It's great to see that it'll now be available to all modders to include. \n\nAlso during the video Matthew talks about the main new feature of the expansion where players will be able to create up to 4 characters for their party to control. So this a major step up from the companion system and you will be able to create whatever classes you want. He also explains that Zehir is a 4th edition D&D God even though the ruleset is still 3.5. Zehir is a the God of darkness, poison, snakes, who are worshipped by the Yuan-Ti, and are your main enemy.\n\nThe official campaign of the expansion will have you go from level 3 to 15 and the expansion should be out Q4 of this year. Definitely a great video to watch and you can also check out this thread on the official forums for more reactions.

(NYSE:HAS), bring new action and adventure into retailers today with the release of Neverwinter Nights� 2: Storm of Zehir. Developed by world-renowned studio Obsidian Entertainment, the second expansion pack for the acclaimed Neverwinter Nights 2 delivers thrilling original D&D® adventures made even more exciting by a host of new gameplay features. Rated �T� for Teens, Neverwinter Nights� 2: Storm of Zehir is now available for the suggested price of $29.99.\n\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir builds on the strong tradition of Dungeons & Dragons computer games by marrying old-school concepts like full party customization and dungeon crawling with new innovations, such as a fully 3D Overland Map feature which allows for free exploration of the non-linear game world. The gripping storyline foreshadows the events that devastate the land of the Forgotten Realms in the Fourth Edition of the Dungeons & Dragons Role-Playing Game released in June 2008. \n\nThe Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir Overland Map feature lets players explore the Chultan Peninsula and Sword Coast in a way never before possible in any Neverwinter Nights game. Players will explore well-known locations, like Neverwinter and Crossroad Keep, alongside lesser travelled areas, such as the xenophobic jungle nation of Samarach. Vicious monsters and groups of bandits populate the Overland Map, and the farther from civilization the player roams, the more difficult the encounters become. \n\nThe 20 to 30-hour campaign in Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir introduces new classes, including the fearsome Hellfire Warlock and the daring Swashbuckler, as well as brand-new spells, creatures, and playable races. Fans of the compelling multiplayer features of Neverwinter Nights 2 will be able to play through Storm of Zehir's campaign in the online cooperative mode, while modders can use the included editor to create their own campaigns and Overland Maps to share online. \n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"157":{"Name":"Test Movie","Author":"Cynroth","Submitted":20081127,"Updated":20081128,"Category":"Trailers","Format":"Various","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is a movie I put together using Windows Movie Maker, and DAZ 3d Studio, where the artwork was originallu conceived.
