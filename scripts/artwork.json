Da'Rania dislikes her fame, and is usually disguising herself as a young sorceress, wearing beautiful purple or red robes.

She can be persuaded into various courses, though she avoids those of thouroughly evil minds, if given the choice. Caring little for the everyday events in Rolsam, and even less for the welfare of Rolsam as a whole, Da'Rania have often argued with Apricane and Pestine Silverleaf, and is not warmly welcomed in Coul, though she is popular in Avosheen and Silvergate for her battles against the creatures striking from below, namely the undead and varmorsas.

In year 2000 when I put up my web site I added the edging to the scan for my web graphic. Sadly, the original has been damaged. *frowns*. From the novel I'm writing she is drow--but raised as a slave in a forest setting. Much of my own background involves a lot of tribal beliefs, so a lot of my art is Native American based. Black Feather is no exception. She originally was copyrighted in 1980 as a regular elf until the drow information came out. I didn't learn of Drizzt until 1994 and nearly trashed everything written of her. Her name is my own spirit name. Currently she is being played on the Winter Watch server under role play for NWN. I am trying to fill out the holes in her life. Her elven name means Sweet Water River.

I'm attempting to create a city, devided into districts, where each district has its own unique character, and where the city's archetecture plays a larger role than simply providing a wall to put a door in. Thus the screenshots; I'm trying to build a city that looks, well, cool - within the limits of the toolset, primarily by building a scene then expanding the idea into a working map.\n\nI've also included the portrait of one of the module's periphial NPCs - he's a bum, really, a half-elf who's idealisticly cynical philosophy on life has left him on the streets. As his ideas mirror my own (in fact the character was created as a sort of DM avatar for, well, me) his role in the module is to push the plot along in the direction I think it should go. In practical terms this means he will show up again and again in the module. His portrait was drawn by hand, then scanned in and Photoshopped in with an alley pulled from the toolset and colored.\n\nMy purpose in posting this is primarily to gather criticism on my ideas and their application, so please comment. More screenshots and related art should be forthcoming.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"831":{"Title":"The Lloth's Drow","Author":"JayAre","Submitted":20050618,"Updated":20050620,"Category":"Original Artwork","Format":"Jpeg","Description":"You stumble into a temple of Lloth, just as \"playtime\" is over...","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"832":{"Title":"Imoen VI","Author":"Bill Atkinson","Submitted":20050619,"Updated":20050621,"Category":"Fan Art","Format":"Mixed media on Bristol Board","Description":"This is Imoen from BG, in a mischievous mood, as usual.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"833":{"Title":"A Proper Rock Dwarf","Author":"Brian Watson","Submitted":20050717,"Updated":20050719,"Category":"Original Artwork","Format":".jpg","Description":"This is how I think a real dwarf should look.

(Name will prolly be changed when I think of something.)\n\nThe Arach'in are the perfect predators...in my eyes.\n\n- Extremely strong exoskeletons...\n\n- Two main complex eyes can see with the equivalence of an eagle, and just as well in the dark...\n\n- Six basic eyes can see the slightest of movements...\n\n- Tiny hairs upon the body of the Arach'in can also detect movements...\n\n- Four tendrils within the mouth that can extend to grasp onto prey, two of these tendrils hold a hidden fang upon the tip. This fang is what delivers the Arach'ins deadly digestive and paralyzing venom concoction into it's prey...\n\n- The Arach'in can project a type of webbing from their throats. This webbing is quite similar to Earth spiders, but also mixed with an organic black substance that increases it's durability making it quite elastic at first...but over time harder then nearly any known substance. It takes quite some time to decompose and the Arach'ins venom has the ability to dissolve it...\n\n- The Arach'in have extremely advanced regenerative capabilities Their mouth tendrils can fully regenerate, if severed, in an about five minutes As for the rest of the Arach'ins body, the limbs don't matter... An Arach'in can survive without it's arms as well as it's legs. It will regrow these lost limbs during their next molting, which takes a year. During the time of it's injuries it can still move about in a manner similar to a serpent...but will normally go into a hibernation like state. If the head or the central body, where the major organs are housed, is destroyed, the Arach'in will die...\n\n- The Arach'in are extremely adaptable to their enviorment. Just as our spiders here on Earth, the Arach'in have adapted and evolved to nearly every environment on countless worlds. There's few places that an Arach'in can't evolve to survive in. These evolutions can cause some physical changes in appearance as well as varrious abilities and hunting characteristics, just as our spiders.\n\n\nSide Note:\n\nThe Arach'in feed by spraying their victim with webbing, and thus coating them in an elastic cocoon. This cocoon is then punctured by the fanged tendrils which inject the prey with the venom...and then the entire sack is pulled into the Arach'ins mouth and swallowed whole, after significant time has passed to liquify the contents. Their jaws can pop somewhat like a serpents to compensate for the size of their prey-filled sack. This means that basically they turn you into a water balloon of yummy goodness.
