The proportioning and textures are fine, and the various starting outfits are actually quite good, but the \"unarmored\" model is just plain silly. Now, I'm not looking for nude models--I'm sure those'll happen soon enough--but I thought the approach of the original game, with what amounted to underwear, made a lot more sense than neck-to-toe peasant clothing. Its especially bizarre when one is starting as something like a warlock, where, at least on the female side, the starting armor is moderately revealing, and you remove it to find a shirt and pants underneath. There's something to be said for making the proportions a little more \"fantastic\"--both male and females more idealized, at least as an option, but I think that's less important.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"8":{"Name":"Idea/Request Quest Wizard","Author":"Jkie47","Submitted":20061110,"Updated":20061111,"Category":"Applications","Type":"Additions","Description":"It�d be great if someone could make a quest wizard like in Nwn1\nI�m having a hell of a time creating quests.\nAnd I�m sure I�m not the only one.","Rating":9,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"9":{"Name":"Level Cap","Author":"Angelius","Submitted":20061111,"Updated":20061111,"Category":"Other","Type":"Suggestions","Description":"I think 20 levels cap is to low.\nCan anyone make a patch for it?","Rating":6.33,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"10":{"Name":"Numeric Keypad Access to Drop-Down Menus","Author":"frodowasaparanoidgnome","Submitted":20061112,"Updated":20061116,"Category":"Other","Type":"Other","Description":"I'd like to see a tool that lets us access the drop-down menu for the current target via the numeric keypad ala the NWN1 radial menus.

You befriend one of the prominent town mages (Kelson Aggrovel) who seems to be of like habits and spend the two years drinking and bragging of exploits never accomplished.

He�s offering a reward to get his lost stock back. He said he saw them go into the old bear cave just outside of town and that there was at least 10. Kelson tells you he�d go look, but he doesn�t want to deal with the bears, which are probably more real than the kobolds. �Old Marcus probably just made a bad deal that�s all�. Anyways, he has a date with an aspiring sorceress and he�s going to take her out to the waterfront for the evening. You decide that for once, you�re going to get out there and do something worth bragging about and go after those kobolds.\n\n\nBear Cave:\nSmall cave with kobolds and merchant loot\nYou arrive at the bear cave and spot 2 kobolds outside. They confront you as you approach and tell you not to come any closer. If you come closer, they attack. Once inside, a lone kobold is there, the leader of the group. The rest of his entourage are scattered around dead as well as the body of one dead brown bear. You can talk him into giving you back the loot or just kill him. Gather up the loot and back to town to brag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to Brughlan:\nTown under siege, PC must help out with battles\nYou come home from your glorious victory and find your hometown has been attacked by a band of seemingly random humanoids and monsters.

You fight your way through them to the leader of the town guard (Garold Griffonwing) who is dueling the half-orc leader. Once dead (half-orc), Garold informs you that every magic user in town was attacked almost simultaneously and now lies dead. He asks you where Kelson is and you say on a trip to the waterfront with a sorceress. He tells you thatthey are in immediate danger and you must head there immediately. If you ask for help, he tells you he would help you but there are too many wounded around and maybe more invaders lurking about.\n\n\nThe Waterfront:\nSmall waterfront area \nYou enter the waterfront area and are confronted immediately by 3 goblins. They ask you why you left your friends to die. You fight through them and eventually come upon the beach area where a bugbear stands over the bodies of you friend and the sorceress. As you approach you hear the bugbear taunting Kelson as he dies. After you beat the bugbear, Kelson tells you of the nicest man in orange robes with the most beautiful glowing rod he�s ever seen, one worthy of kings. He was surrounded by bugbears and goblins and all manners of creatures. The man offered him a chance at kingdoms and riches and promised him fame and glory. He didn�t really know why, but he felt it�d be wrong to join this man.

Or just scroll to the bottom then look over it.\n\n\nThe Creation of Things -\n\nThe Mortal Realm was nothing but swirling dust particles. It was only used as the \"no man's land\" in the war between the Demons and Helzian (Like the Gods). Alas, when the Helzian pushed the Demons back to their foul dimension the Mortal Realm was of no use if they left it as is. Together they used their power to create to the world. Creating in all 30,000 galaxies. However, oldly enough, they only choice one planet to create life upon. This world was called Tilunia by the Helzian, but later called Zanroth by it's inhabbitents. With that, several races evolved.\n\nBrief List of Races - Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, Ents, Dragons(Few), Halflings, and most other animals of Earth. There are also Elementals.\n\nHumans - The primary race of Zanroth, it's population is the biggest. Later in history it boils down to three kingdoms then four then three again.\n\nElves - There are two types of Elves, Archenlander Elves and Telmarian Elves. Archenlander can easily be compared to High Elves while the Telmarian Elves can be compared to Wood Elves. NOTE:High Elves are the most adept at magic and the most intelligent. While the Wood Elves are the most agile as well as cunning, they make excellent Shock Troopers or Light Infantry.\n\nDwarves - As in all tales, legendary craftsmen of old. Humans evolved from Dwarves as did Halflings and Elves. Dwarves are the oldest of races. And before the 'arrival' of the other races, demons poured onto Zanroth. The Dwarves were given the task of fighting these demons themselves. With hammer and fury the Dwarves drove back the Demons. Dwarves are stout, strong, hardy, and the best smiths. (Aside from Demons on the smiths part)\n\nOrcs - Orcs are of Demon descedent. They are off springs of Half Elf and Half Demon. So the Orcs are one of the most recent races, as they were only formed 7,000 years ago from where the Neverwinter Nights 2 RP will start. Orcs are brutal, surprisingly intelligent, strong, fast, and hardy. However they find it hard to take orders making them very unorganized unless under the direct watch of an overseer.\n\nEnts - Techinally the oldest of the old, they did come before Dwarves, however, they are not of the flesh as are other races. The Ents came before trees. There were trillions of Ents until eventually they 'died' and turned into simple trees. The oldest Ent is Hardrim who is a master of lore as well as magics.\n\nDragons - Are from the Demon realm and are actually Demons. However, most were intelligent enough to go off on their own and do things their own way. The Dragons of Old rivaled the power of even the Helzian. But the Dragons were slain by the combine forces of the Ents and Helzian in order to secure the furture of Zanroth. Some say the most powerful and oldest dragons remains. Yamar is this ones name. The later descendents of dragons were not as powerful as their ancestors. However, they are more civilized but perhaps not as cunning.\n\nHalflings - Halflings evolved from Dwarves and migrated south, to the empty continent of Telmar. Telmar would later be home to the Wood Elves, as it's covered in tall trees and forests. The Haflings made little huts in the base of the trees.\n\nElementals (and Golems) - Spawns and constructs of the messangers of the Demons. The five messangers were Jarm, Furnic, Kaz'kela, Urzpic, and Gurn. All of them were destroyed and slain when they attacked the Dwarves except Gurn. Gurn was not the most powerful but the most ruthless and cunning, which allowed him to escape before the Dwarves could kill him. After the battle, the Elementals and Golems went willd and spread across the world. None know how they managed to cross the Great Sea without any boat or way across. But they did manage. The Elementals make up some of the most deadliest foes.\n\nHistory, Volume 1, Chapter 1 - After the Great Battle, as it was known. (Dwarves drive back the Demons alone) Dwarven King, Untalias Goldsteel, leads his people out of the large Frozen Wastelands and to the largest mountain in the whole of Zanroth, Mount Yamar it is called. (Yes, named after the most power of Dragons as that is what they thought it was once they first saw it). Once inside, they found it was already conviently hollowed out for them and began settling inside the warm interior of Mount Yamar. With that, they began crafting weapons at a large rate just incase of another attack and began training all men to fight. The most the Dwarves had to fight where the Ice Wendigos of the North. THere were many indeed great battles, all of which have been lost or not recorded.\n\nChapter 2 - Thousands of years later, Halflings evolve as well as Humans and Elves. The Halfings migrated to Telmar, while the Humans and High Elves evolved from Dwarves who migrated to Faroth. (Faroth is where the majority of the RP is going to take place). The Wood Elves evolved from High Elves who then migrated to Telmar. Human barbarians roam the Northern parts of Old Faroth while the High Elves attempt to civilize themselves as well as befriend the creatures in the South.\n\nChapter 3 - 7,000 years later Humans civilize into City-States. Vinnengael, the most Northern and largest city-state becomes the most powerful. However, the City-States war for another 1,000 years. This is known as \"The Thousand Year War.\"\n\nChapter 4 - 998 Year of The Thousand Year War a stranger appears. He calls him self Kazile Arakal. His skin is pale, his hair is blood red. He wears armor as black as Demon Hide and wields a large sinister looking claymore. This stranger is a hybrid. A Half Demon. He is the youngest son of Xaro, the oldest and most powerful demon. Being shunned by his kin, this stranger came to the mortal realm to conquest and do what his kin could not. Instead of summoning minor demons to his aid right away, he corrupted Men with dark magics. He began using this magic first in Vinnengael. Using this techinque, he became the Emperor of Vinnengael and it's surronding City-States. Vinnengael becomes a dark place. But a human hunter of Vinnengael, Eragon, and his allies, Castan an odd creature at the time. But it is later found out he is Telmarian. (By this time, Humans never met with any of the other races except High Elves from Archenland). Castan could shapeshift into many creatures, including a dragon. Shademhar was also an ally of Eragon. A High Elf Crusade. Together, they manage to rally men together and attack Vinnengael. Durning the siege, Castan transformed into a dragon. Eragon and Shademar rode on him in order to get into the city. Once inside Castan transformed into a great tiger and with Shademhar managed to hold off the forces of Kazile. Eragon, with his weapons blessed by the Helzian, searched for Kazile in the fray. He found Kazile walking down the steps of the City Hall. Eragon clashed with Kazile, but Kazile slew Eragon. Shademhar and Castan then came and also attacked Kazile. Kazile slew Shademhar and corrupted Castan with his magics and made him morph into a great demon. The Helzian, combining all their powers managed to revive Eragon as an elf, and later revived Shademhar after the battle. Eragon confronted the uncontrolable Castan and shot him with a blessed arrow. The arrow pierced Castan. Castan fell, and morphed back into his regular form. Eragon had to leave Castan unconsiouce on the ground inorder to stop Kazile. Eragon again confronted Kazile. Eragon, with some type of miracle managed to disarm Kazile in combat, fling off his helmet and drive his blade through his head. Kazile fell, his army crumbled and Vinnengael would stand. For now.\n\nChapter 5 - From the far North of Faroth, in Vinnengaelian land, there were Barbarian Tribes. They began causing more trouble then usual and it seemed they were rallying together under one banner. Eragon, elected the head of Vinnengael, went to see what was going on for himself. While visting the Governer of the North he noticed he was acting not himself and direly wanted to go back to Vinnengael. (Also, Castan was chosen as Eragon's advisor. Castan and Eragon were great friends.) Once the governer arrived he seemed to transform into an entirely different person. He transformed into a man with brownish redish hair, pale skin. THe man was wielding an evil looking longsword and the armor of Kazile. This man said he was Dagnarus Arakal, son of Kazile Arakal. (Dagnarus is 25% Demon) Dagnarus, unlike his father, gained the tribes' and peoples' support by his ideas and word of mouth. Not magic. THe Barbarians attacked Vinnengael and took over it. However these 'Barbarians' were civilized under Dagnarus's control and were told not to harm any innoccents or loot the city. Eragon and Castan fleed South. Dagnarus and his new bride campagined Southward. By the team they met the Ocean in the South, Eragon and Castan had fled East into the Great Desert. Dagnarus campagined into the desert facing many harsh sand storms. Then, in a small village where Eragon's army was camped, Dagnarus came in on a horse by himself, unarmed and told Eragon he had a chance to surrender and all his men would be spared and let go. Eragon refused. Dagnarus rode back to his army, geared up and attacked. Dagnarus's army was much larger and quickly overwhelmed Eragon's forces. Castan and Eragon managed to flee. None know where to and to this day they remain missing.\n\nVolume 2, Chapter 1 - Dagnarus united Faroth and create the Arakalian Empire. Emperor Dagnarus Arakal I had only one son, Hyu Arakal. Since he was five, Hyu was trained at the Arakal Imperial Academy in the capitol, Arakal City. When Hyu was at the age of 20, Dagnarus Disappeared. Hyu inheirted the throne and became Emperor Hyu Arakal I. (Another thing I should mention is that Kazile's claymore and Dagnarus's sword are the same weapon. It's called the Blade of Arakal and it has the ability to morph into any sword for it's wielder. Only those with at least 25% Arakalian DEMON blood in them may change it's shape. Dagnarus took the sword with him when he disappeared.)\n\nChapter 2 - There was unrest in the far deserts of the East. Some say it was rumors of the Vinnengaelians rising up. However, it wasn't. It was an honorable man attempting to liberate his people. His name, Richard Larek. Richard was the best swordsman of all time as well as one of the greatest tactisians. Richard managed to take the whole of the whole of the Great Desert and take some of the Eastern fertile lands. At the small village of Banon, Richard and Hyu met on horse back at the river crossing. Both armed and armored. Hyu made a tempting proposal. \"An expidition team I sent South found a large body of land. The size of the Fertile Land, if not a bit bigger. It is unsettled by Men. I will give you this if you return the desert and leave for there.\" Richard accepted. Also, despite being enemies, Hyu and Richard had befriended each other over the years of battle. Richard and his people moved South to this new land and named it Archenland.\n\nChapter 3 - Calmor, an Ancient High Elven City, which was still inhabbited by a few High Elves was made the Capitol of Archenland. Richard befriended the odd creatures there. Ents, Goblins, High Elves, and other odd creatures. Richard married an Elven Princess.\nThings were looking well for the new Kingdom of Archenland. Also, I should mention that Garnarsh, an ancient High Elven blade was given to Richard when he became the King. It's magic was of the Helzian and it's steel unbreakable.\n\nChapter 4 - Richard and his wife had 12 daughters and one son. Edmund was the name of the young son. Hyu had one son (and later two kids from his second wife) Rillian was this son. He was extremely well looking and extremely adept with frost and dark magics, getting deeply involved in his Demon heirtage. Hyu, his wife, and Rillian visited Calmor to mourn for the death of High King Richard Larek I of Archenland. His death came suddenly with a queer illness. Richard's youngest daughter, who was 17, fell in love with Rillian, 20. In their long stay in Archenland, Rillian married Richard's youngest daughter. When the mourning was done, the Council of Archenland was assembled. A minor Silver Dragon, three High Elves, two Dwarves, five Halflings, two Ents, and eight Humans made up the Council of Archenland. They had to decide a steward until the young Edmund, 5, could inheirt the throne. There was muching debate, but suddenly from the back corners of the throne room a man said,\n\"Enough! I thought this was a council was of descion, not of debate. If you cannot decide then I will. I shall take the position of steward. Long have I lived in Archenland and watched from the shadows, long have I been around and seen many a battle and advised plenty of men.\" The figured was in an elegant gold, green, and purple robe. Wearing a Purple and Green Helm. These were the clothes of Castan. The council was silent. Then the queen said, \"So be it. Castan shall be the Steward.\" This shocked all in the room, except for Rillian. The next week Hyu, his wife, Rillian and his bride departed for Arakal City.\n\nChapter 5 - Hyu was concered with Rillian's obession with dark magic. Hyu went to confront Rillian in his lab when he found Rillian missing. Hyu was furious and figured Rillian had run off to make a fool of Hyu. After two weeks Hyu's anger went to concern. Later, he recieved reports of invasion from the Northeast. Orcs, his men had said...\n\nChapter 6 - Hyu had married again and had two twins. Romulus and Remus whom were now at the ages of 19. Edmund had grown into a tall man at the age of 32. Hyu was too old to fight against these Orcs. So Edmund, Romulus and Remus assembled men and went to what they saw as the sources of the Orcs. A large island Northeast of the Arakalian Empire. The island was rocky and barren. The Union of Swords was formed. This Union consited of the High Elves, Archenlanders, Arakalians, and Dwarves from both the Frozen North and Archenland. These forces went to that island and made a large fort there. There the Union of Swords advance and managed to slay the Orcs in their way. In the middle of the Island the Union had run into a large citadel. It's stone was of old, and the gates large and dark. The Union broke down the gates and entered.\n\nChapter 7 - The Union secure the 'Court Yard' as it was called around the Citadel. However the Court Yard was of the size of three large fields. High King Edmund Larek I and some Archenlanders charged into the citadel while the rest were to remain behind. None know what quite happened inside, but Edmund had come out alone, Garnarsh shimmering in the light of the Sun which was piercing through the black clouds. His older sister flung over his shoulder unconscious. The citadel made cracking sounds and th Union of Swords had to retreat out of it's Court Yard and far back. The citadel had collapsed into a pit of lava which it was built over.\n\nSide note: Rillian was indeed the known leader of the Orcs and other Shadows. It was believed Edmund slew Rillian inside the citadel.\n\nVolume 3, Chapter 1 - Volume 3, Chapter 1 - High King Edmund Larek I died at the age of 157. (Archenlander High Kings have Elven Blood in them, all of the Kings have had Elven Blood except King Richard Coeur De Lion, founder of the Kingdom of Archenland, whom was human.) He had five sons and seven daughters. The most important sons are the 3rd son and the last 5th son. The 3rd was Richard II while the 5th was Jedash I. Jedash was a swordsman like no other, best of his time, while Richard was the best wizard, even compared to Remus (Which I�ll cover in the Arakal Section) The choice of Kingship is not decided by age, but by skill. Richard II and Jedash I were the last two. Both had shown great promising kingdom managing and combat talent. The final test was of their courage. Each were put into an illusion in their minds by the most powerful psychics. Richard II was able to resist them longer, but the test wasn�t to resist. No one will say of what the illusion consisted of, but one of the illusionists was an assassin and managed to kill Richard II. The assassin himself was then killed before he could kill Jedash. Jedash then inherited the throne. His descendents were of great swordsman.\n\nChapter 2 - 4,000 years after Rillian. Through a dark portal uncovered under Arakal City, Xaro Arakal and his kin arrived. They easily dominated and claimed the Arakal Empire for themselves making it a terrible place. Xaro and his kin attacked Archenland. The High King of the Archenlanders was believed to have ended because Castan (He has infinite youth as an elf) had been the steward for 700 years. The bloodline seemed to just disappear as well as Garnarsh with the bloodline. Castan sent Archenland's finest to Xaro and his kin. THey managed to hold him off but not without losing land just North of Calmor. Xaro created a mountain range around this land and made a fort there and made it the new capitol figuring it'd be easier to attack the Archenlanders if he transported the Capitol Guard as well as removing and moving the portal there. With that, Xaro has been attacking the Archenlanders. Telmarian Elves arrived on the eastern part of Archenland and began aiding the Archenlanders in their attempt to liberate the Human Arakalians and defend their home.\n\n\nThis is an RP idea my friend and I made up.

If the character passes both checks then the assumed price the item will sell for will show in the tooltip.\n\nIf the person who deems this worthy enough to create (if there is anyone who would) wishes to be ambitious then they could have a little fun with the character's ability to appraise, the strength of the lore/appraisal checks could alter the price of the item slightly, with it varyingly random towards the character thinking it has more worth than it does or less.\n\nThis would be handy for long dungeon runs where a lot of items are acquired, the character would then be able to identify these items (using standard lore) and further, if they find the item to be no use to their party, they can decide which items are the most likely to drop to collect later (if possible), thus lightening their load as nessescary.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"32":{"Name":"Beholders","Author":"AramilAmastia","Submitted":20061202,"Updated":20061206,"Category":"Module","Forum Thread":"Link","Type":"Monsters","Description":"I'm thinking about the Underdark that will be included in my server, and I just realized that there are not enough Underdark-like monsters to choose from.\n\nCan someone make models for certain races found in the Underdark?","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"33":{"Name":"Toolset Character Editor Plugin","Author":"B.

Now with the vendor and the loot windows, we have a clean list of items, it's easy to read what the items are and to scroll through them. However, the player bags are quite different, utilising four blocks of icons.\n\nI could understand this if this were cohesive but even the magic bags seem to utilise the same system as the clean loot window, by default. This is simply odd. I'm surprised that that system isn't available for the player bags at least as an accessibility option, as for a person with either poor sight or a poor memory (both of which I have) it might be helpful. I find the default player bags to be a little unintuitive and cumbersome, so I try to get magic bags as soon as possible but they're far more rare in the game than they should be.\n\nThe new magic bag sizes in the latest patch do help but I have an idea I think might be even better.\n\nThe Idea:\n\nWhat if the player bags used the same system of display as the loot bags? Where the item names are visible and thus finding particular items in a more speedy manner would be less painful. Instead of having that block of icons there with the four-button selector at the top, it could simply be a loot window. Yet this brings up other questions ...\n\nThe loot window doesn't exactly sort anything, yet the vendor does (into neat little categories, no less) and poking at the store.xml, I had an idea about this. I'm not exactly good enough with Neverwinter Nights 2 yet to implement this myself and therefore I don't even know if it's possible but picture this: Instead of the four bag buttons, there would be buttons which are tiny versions of those the vendor has. Clicking on one would show the items of that category that the player has.\n\nSo clicking on the armour button would show the player's armour, with the list of the armour category sorted in the same way (possibly by the same code) as the vendor sorts its display.\n\nIf there is no list sorting code on vendors, perhaps a simple filter could be introduced to put the displayed items into alphabetical order or something like that.\n\nAnother flaw in this idea I realise is that concentrating on the categorisation for a moment, the categorisation itself could be clever illusion of sorts. I would imagine it would be simpler to implement a real categorisation system rather than kludging something like that togther though and if the categorisation system is real, it's whether that could translate over to the player's inventory, antoher factor I have no clue about.\n\nWrapping Up:\n\nI realise that this might be a huge project, depending on what's already available in the Neverwinter Nights 2 API but I find that inventory systems such as the one I've described are often the holy grail in RPGs and MMORPGs. I've observed communities of RPGs which can be modified try to create this kind of organisation for their items with varying degrees of success and considering store.xml, it might just be possible to rework that code into the player inventory, so a lot of the work towards this idea might've been done already. I don't know.\n\nI do believe however that for accessibility alone, this kind of inventory would be an absolute boon to a lot of people, even if it involved a whole bunch of files that had to be spread between the override and the UI, it'd still be wholly worth it in my opinion.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"41":{"Name":"Bring over the works!","Author":"Alucard'schild","Submitted":20061209,"Updated":20061211,"Category":"Other","Type":"Additions","Description":"could I ask if we can bring over the mods like, Wheel of Time, Final Fantasy 7 and portraits of the original game over to NWN2?

The class is not allowed to wear armor, and focuses on extreme offense. My preference would be for a 2 Weapon Fighting build, cause that's just cool. Here are the class specs:\n\nAfter years of study, training, and battle, the Kensai has perfected their fighting style and disciplined their minds to be as sharp as their swords. They devote themselves to the mastery of one weapon, and this allows them to dual wield that weapon effortlessly. With lightening speed and terrifying grace, the Kensai becomes a whirlwind of terrible steel.\n\nHit Die: d10\nBAB: High\nSaves: Fortitude and Reflex\nSkill Points: 3 + Int. Modifier\n\nRequirements:\nTwo Weapon Fighting, dodge, cleave, great cleave, weapon focus: any 1 handed melee, BAB +6\n\nSpecial Abilities:\n\nLvl 1) - Weapon of Choice (all Kensai feats will only work with this weapon. Same as Weapon Master)\n - 2 Weapon Defense\n\nLvl 2) Ki Smite (Weapon Master)\n\nLvl 4) - Improved Two Weapon Fighting\n - Two Swords as One (Weapon of Choice treated as Light when determining off hand penalties)\n\nLvl 5) Whirlwind\n\nLvl 6) Monk AC Bonus\n\nLvl 7) Uncanny Dodge, Mobility\n\nLvl 8) Total Focus (Once per day the Kensai can concentrate all of his attention on one target.

This ability lasts 2 rounds + Kensai's WIS modefier.\n\nLvl 9) Evasion\n\nLvl 10) Greater Two Weapon Fighting\n\nNotes: I recognize that in its current form the class might be slightly overpowered, but I think that the large requirements and the emphasis on multiple stats balances that somewhat.\n\nThe problem is I'm not sure how to code Custom Classes in NWN2.

The arrival of the protagonists father (becoming the Fallen God or something similar) will also play a part in the devastation of Tethyr, and how the confused armies resulting from the end of the Throne of Bhaal chapter were kept back from straying into Amnish territory.\n\nThey story itself may expand into a few other parts of Faerun - maybe even Maztica - to include most of the old party. The canon ending party (Aerie, Child of Bhaal, Sarevok, Minsc, Jan Jansen, and Imoen) will play major parts in the story. They'll be silent NPC's and seen as more or less as shadows instead of interactive characters. The player may fight beside these people later in the story, but not as part of their party (the new party will from then contain Minsc, Jan Jansen, Sarevok, Jaheira, and Aerie's daughter/your sister.) NPC characters within the party will be given the same in-depth backgrounds and interactions as was seen in BG2, because the main reason why the BG series was so great was because of how incredibly involving the storyline was. the NWN2 storyline did have such involvements, but it really wasnt to the scale of BG2. We're going to try and achieve that.\n\nThis is simply an idea, and an unofficial mod to NWN2 - not an actual sequel before we get someone telling us to stop because of some sort of copyright. =]\n\nThe only problem with creating it is as im still at school, i have next to no time to create it with my own hands, and i have next to no skill with the toolkit.

Mysterious goddess type. She has enemies, she's forgotten much, lost most of her powers and she's looking for something that could determine the fate of the universe. She's also _not_ the PC. :-P\n\n2. The childhood friend. Tomboy type, grew up with the PC, tends to action first, planning later. She may have a bit of a crush on the PC but she's not going to admit that to him. She's too young for it to be anything but puppy love in any case. She respects 'the goddess type' and is in a little awe of her but doesn't let that stop them from becoming friends.\n\n3. The PC. He, or she, has a touch of the dark to him. In his(/her) history and/or in his personality. (It's cliched but picking one or more from the \"foundling\", \"parents killed at an early age\" might work ;-)\n\nThe Plot\n--------\n'The goddess type' is already acquainted with the other two at the start of the game. She doesn't know exactly what she's looking for, but she'll know it when she gets it. Probably. She also has an idea as to where to look for it, and that is in The Field.\n\nThe Field is at one time a normal looking scraggly abandoned hay meadow and at the same time a mystical place where nothing is quite what it seems. On the mundane level it is mostly surrounded by the ordinary modern rural town where 'the childhood friend' and 'the PC' grew up. There is only one way to enter the field, an alley with a low building (garage) on one side and a tall building on the other. Normal people tend to ignore the field, and possibly are incapable of seeing it in normal circumstances.\n\nIn the field is also The Crow. The Crow is a shapechanger. It can grow to monstrous size and change its appearance - in the module (dream) it only changed between species of crow. It is obviously powerful and magical but whether it is intelligent is not made clear. It either can't, or chooses not to, speak.\n\nAt the start The Field is just one of several places 'the goddess type' leads the PC and 'childhood friend' on the search. This gives the opportunity to set up a feel for things and briefly introduce places and people that you may be seeing later. However she soon becomes convinced that The Field is the place to go. The Crow is initially enigmatic and aloof but not openly hostile, but this changes as soon as The Nut is found.\n\nSymbolically The Nut could represent unknown potential, the future, or any number of things. 'The goddess type' spots is when the PC is near to it and points it out to him. However as the PC goes to pick it up The Crow turns to monstrous size and drives them all out of the field.\n\n/Initially/ 'the goddess type' is convinced that it is The Nut that she is looking for. The player should be given the chance to try various ways to get into the field to grab it but all fail. Then comes the twist. The two companions go to The Field _without_ the PC (possibly he's stuck in bed with a cold) and, rashly, have a go by themselves. The Tomboy type manages to climb up to the garage roof and jumps into The Field in an attempt to avoid being spotted (and/or be nearer to the nut at the start). Surprisingly although The Crow flies into The Field and alongside her as she runs out with her prize it doesn't attack her. When she is out they look back to see The Crow has changed to a normal sized Jackdaw and is standing next to where the nut was, and at that moment a seedling springs up from the ground at that very spot. [Next module The Field will have changed into The Forest]\n\nAlthough clearly significant, 'the goddess type' is now uncertain that The Nut was really what she was looking for - it seems more likely that it is just the first clue in her search. However they have a bigger question to answer - \"Why did The Crow not stop the childhood friend getting the nut?\" Or rather \"Why did it stop _the PC_ from getting the nut?\"\n\nOn talking that one out there are two disturbing ideas that come to them. \n1. Suppose the PC is not to be trusted? If The Crow was a guardian beast then it may have some way to tell what darkness lurks within a man. \n2. The Nut may 'do something' if the PC touches it, 'something' that if not happening in the right place and/or with the right preparations could have devastating results.\n\nIf either of those are true (and they aren't the only possibilities) they may be better off just not letting the PC know that they've got it. And it's at that point that the dream (/introductory module) ends.\n\nFor atmosphere think Narnia or Enid Blyton. Plenty of excitement but not so much in the way of explicit violence. \n\nWell I hope that somebody finds this of interest, and I'm going to try to go back to sleep now.","Rating":9.25,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"118":{"Name":"what do you think?","Author":"Alen Swift","Submitted":20070409,"Updated":20080713,"Category":"Expansion","Forum Thread":"Link","Type":"Additions","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"I think we dont need a expantion as far as a story goes, just expantions with more buildings, creatures, scripts and placeables, that kinda stuff would be fine.

Major cities are on seperate worldspace, and smaller ones are randomly generated via script (or just made by many people doing this one project).\n\n2: Randomly generated home interiours (just two to three box shapes on one massive interiour area for a town, including a non-random stairway with a nonrandom door.\n\n3: Randomly Generated Minor dungeons, that generate once, then about six in-game weeks later.... your character forgets and the place is regenerated. (note that these will also be premade areas without placables, but a script to spawn them)\n\n4: Permadeath W/ Option to save and go from save.\n\n5: Randomly Generated quests in taverns.\n\n6: Randomly Generated raids on various major areas and the surrounding countryside.\n\n7: Fast travel as a script that brings up the world map (major cities and dungeons only)\n\n8: Possible life as a commoner, or a militia member.\n\n9: people recognize your race and act upon this. this is with the exeption of nonstandard races.\n\n10: People are actually afraid of warlocks\n\n11: A worship system that gains bonuses to various skills and saves depending on what god you worship\n\n12: A random enemy spawning system that fires when somebody walks into the trigger. various versions of this for various areas, sending out leveled varients of every creature (though wildlife isn't leveled, and beasts from the underdark tend to be anywhere from 0-3 levels above you. power wise) from that area.\n\n13: parts of the underdark under the local area (accessable by cave-dungeon)\n\n14: Shadow plane of the area, a plane of mirrors linked to a mages guild (With murderous doubles of PC's!), and other goodies.\n\n15: The ability to be linked to other such area projects Via a campaign folder. all portions of faerun completed are sent to a single compiler, who turns them all into a single campaign that's really a freeform world\n\n16: Randomly generated walkpaths for NPC's, a crime and punishment system (with ability to resist arrest) and a feature that allows you to choose your home city or nation in the area (with bonuses like a more lax legal system, better opportunities for work, and a bonus to your characters saves (and skills pertaining to that area) that goes away when you leave the area, and when you enter again, comes back. this will also affect which nations accept you, which ones kill you on sight, and which ones give you bonuses. (IE, Thayvians and those who grow up there tend to be shunned by other nations, possibly even killed on sight if that information gets out).\n\n17: Drow MUST start out at one of the underdark cities. most other races are not welcome there, and might be captured and sold (same effect as dying). The exeptions to this are mainly tieflings, who have anywhere from a 25-75% chance of being accepted... for business purposes.\n\n18: The setting is about average in terms of magic. anything better than+5 to one character stat has a 75% chance of being destroyed... meaning that if you want artifacts, you have to get them from the game itself, or be lucky, and save your game to keep them.\n\n19: Some places might have portals to a part of one of the layers of the nine hells. Generally, Asimar are killed on sight, tieflings are automatically accepted, and other races have a 5% chance per day spent there to be attacked on sight after speaking to one of the devils, in which case they must get out and wait a month to go back and be \"Welcome\".\n\n20: A system to rest, and one to wait. resting outside of town has a 1-30% chance of a creature spawning and interrupting your rest. far away from town, this increases to 50-75%. Waiting has the same effects, but you can do this longer, and unlike resting, doing this in town and not inside an inn (or inside one when you snuck into a room) has a 20-75% chance of you being charged with loitering or squatting.... which is worth a jail sentance or a fine (the fine is always going to be a little more than the cost of staying at any of the inns in the game, plus or minus half of the base fine, which is the price of the inns normal rooms +10 gold pieces)\n\n21: Towns will have NPC's randomly generated (for minor ones), and have randomly chosen dialogue. Major ones will have dialogue prechosen in addition to random selectable pieces of dialogue, then be spawned in the home area given (which is NOT randomly generated, and is one massive area for important buildings in important cities) via an encounter/spawn point system.\n\n22: (last, I swear). there are options (via an item that triggers only for DM's) to make any building a player-ownable building, which stays uninhabited until a player gets there, and a key is produced that can be bought from a local property store. One of these will appear without a DM's help per district per city. All other homes in the area (which appear at random too) have a randomly generated NPC. O course, all things can be possessed here.\n\n\nAnd this massive idea is meant to create a single (or multi, if you want to host, find a host, or find a server doing this) player roleplaying enviroment. There should be two ways to start the game- Server will depend on persistancy files (IE like the ones used to preserve your location on certain NWN1 PW's, but these will store town layouts, placed items in homes, and the items that each character has, in addition to other goodies I might have forgotten)\n\nOr you can choose start one in normal mode, which relies on savegames.\n\nIt's an amazing Idea, but to get this to work would require a MASSIVE team, and ton of scripting. For an idea of a primitive version of this (VERY primitive) go to the Bethsoft website and download their freeware copy of TES:ARENA . if/when this idea is made as a mod, I would like to encourage that this be servervault when it inevitably (if done by a team of modders or even a single modder over much time) is loaded onto a server. However, the minimum level should be at least five... another encouraged thing.\n\nI would perfer that most of the guidelines here for creation apply when the modder makes this (I'd love it if all did!) but even if just half are followed, or comprimizes are reached in some areas, I'll still enjoy the mod a lot! (then again, I'd also perfer it if only hall-of-famers for NWN2 touched this idea, and bugtested it for months before releasing it, but there are some things that you just can't expect from this world).\n\n\nAll I require if you use this idea is that you submit it as \"(teamname/modder), Idea by Joseph Hines\"","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"160":{"Name":"MutantNinjaDwarf's NWN1 Models","Author":"Wolfsknight","Submitted":20070707,"Updated":20070715,"Category":"Other","Type":"Additions","Description":"I think it would be nice to see some conversions of the elf models MutantNinjaDwarf made for NWN1\n\nLink","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"161":{"Name":"Specific area targeting","Author":"Joseph HInes","Submitted":20070712,"Updated":20070715,"Category":"Script","Short Description":"A way to get fallout-esque body part attacks in this psuedoaction game.","Type":"Additions","Description":"Here's my idea- A DMFI compatable extra option bar, kind of like the modebar.\n\nthis is called the targeting bar. you choose one target, or toggle off targeting, and choosing one target with another enabled will replace the older current target with the newer one.\n\neach target will have a modifier to hit (all negative) and a modifier to damage (all positive)... but vital organs will have not only a large modifier to damage, but also to crit chance (if the player does not get a crutial hit, a script fires that gives the player a 25-75% chance of a crit anyway, so long as they hit. then a crit damage total is rolled, the damage already done is subtracted, and the difference is taken from the target's hitpoints)\n\nhere's a basic list of targets:\n\nHeart: (+2 to +4 d20)X(weapon crit damage value) to damage on hardcrit, +1d6 damage without crit(crit represents if it hit the target as intended) hardcrit chance: 10%\nmiss chance: 25 to 50 %. only works on humanoid, monstrous humanoid, and reptelian humanoid, though for certain outsiders and abberations (if the character succeeds on a lore check that depends on the tags of said creatures) this may also work.\n\nLegs (both) : no added instant damage or hardcrit value, 30% miss chance, gives a penalty of 50% max run speed (and 50% max walk speed), which does not stack (with exeptions, see below). When done to vermin or other many-legged creatures, does a stacking 7.5% penalty to speed per successful attempt. all of these penalties are taken off when the target rests, though by the time you are finished with them, they shouldn't be breathing anymore... unless you ran away or died.\n\nArms: No extra damage, 35% miss chance.\nWhen attacking humanoid, monstrous humaniod, or reptelian humanoid targets, first attempt puts a penalty of -2 to all of the target's attacks, and the second puts a -4 penalty to all of the target's attack, in addition to making them have to roll (from a d100) 26+ (taken care of by scripting) or miss automatically. the second attempt to break the arms has a 75% miss chance, but does not take off the previous penalty if it misses.\n\nNeck: has a 50-75% miss chance. if successful, the hit acts as if that from a vorpal sword, that basically runs on this principle: target rolls a 1d20 without a modifier from saves (though if his class is one with a high fort or reflex save, he gets a +2 to +6 depending on how many levels he has. if he's your level or below, +2. if he's above you by two levels, +4 bonus, 4 levels, +6 bonus) if you are the same level as him, he must roll, with bonuses for class and level, a 14. if you are two levels higher than him, the DC is increased to 16. at four levels higher, the DC is increased to 20, and at 6 levels higher, 24, and at 8+ levels higher, the DC is 28.\n\n\nCrotch: 25% miss chance, 25% hardcrit chance, damage dependant on gender. If the target is female, aiming at the crotch does no more damage than it normally would, though the target is diseased (with plague) due to septic poisoning (her bowls have been cut thru). if the target is male, however.... the pain gives him the paralize effect for 3 seconds on a hardcrit, in addition to multiplying damage by 2. this is in addition to base \"it's hit!\" damage multiplier of X1.5, thus, a hardcrit will multiply normal attacking damage by 3, and the character is desiesed as above due to septic poisoning on any successful hit if male.\n\n\nGuts: 25% miss chance, no hardcrit.\nOn a successful hit, the target has base damage multiplied by 2, and those around him/her/it must make a DC20 fort save or vomit (represented by being dazed, and a con modifier of -2. these effects last for 3 seconds)\n\n\nAnyway, just a system like this (though much more balanced, all sorts of fine tuning... just the body parts and general effects should be used, not the numeric values.)... so that those of us who liked fallout's being able to attack specific body parts will be able to do this in heavy action sequences in certain modules (it'd be a big hit for PW's too, so don't forget to make this work with PvP!).","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"162":{"Name":"Scripted dates","Author":"SungSung","Submitted":20070716,"Updated":20070718,"Category":"Script","Short Description":"Concept of calendar date events in a PW.","Type":"Systems","Description":"After looking at Qk's Calendar UI, I wondered if it would be possible to script events according to certain dates in a PW.

Most of the living is done in the caverns that continue to extend across Faerun, though when you are not in wolf form, you are able to enjoy a great many human towns. this is all a bunch of sandbox enviroments spread out across the world map, with dynamic (oblivion-like) NPC social reactions, and the ability to speak about any subject you currently have unlocked (meaning you know about it). there is a crime and punishment system in all cities, but the one in the caverns is rather brutal. you fight other criminals, and if you win three matches, you are free to go. if not, you are revived, and drafted for the workforce and sent out to convert others with volunteers, who keep you under control whilst you change others to your species. enemies only appear in wilderness areas if they have a CR equal to your level, though when you enter caves and towns, the scaling ends. you also can, in any fight, choose a specific body part to concentrate attacks on (Via the modebar), switch form to wolf form (which always happens at night, and can't be switched back at night until dawn), infect others (Via an item that cannot be dropped, which grants a feat used for this), and when you get to level ten, have your wolf form become that of a dire wolf, increasing the gains at twice the level/power rate of regular wolf form. worship of any diety continues unless they are against werebeasts, and you can raid other less organized werecreatures. all the character classes except the paladin are permitted, and you get the ability to switch your alignment to lawful and back (for the purposes of the monk class, though this change switches back in 2.5 minutes). Spread the \"disease\" By using the bite feat, granted via another item.\n\nwant to involve others? the process is simple. start a game (or a server), and then your friends will be able to start as a lycanthrope or a normal(which means that they can be affected with lycanthropy, but them not having it now results in them getting a bonus item which is removed when they are infected. item depends on class). then if they chose normal, and when the lycanthropes descend upon the town that they started in (generated by randomness, alignment, race, and class), they can join you, finding that lycanthropes are not as evil as they thought! (alignment does not change, and classes and feats are not removed. they just gain a few things)\n\nEventually, the world ends up with 100% lycanthropes, with the exeption of about 1% that are born as normals with a resistance to conversion. (and at this point one can only choose normal 1% of the time). when this happens, it's basically a sandbox game with a multiplayer component.\n\nThough this isn't all! a few changes are made to this game (scripts, etc... no one has to download twice, since no areas are changed. the areas must be made to be of minimal impact to a dedicated server.) to turn this into a PW module! and since the areas are not changed (look above), people with the module in their folder can play without an extra download!\n\n\n\n\n*(note, I accidentally included the word \"Module\" somewhere that suggests this will be a campaign. this is not true. the mod has the areas taken out (nothing else, so suggest something to the guy putting it all together) and added to the game, along with the links being placed where the makers intended on one world map [which will increase in size as time goes on and people make more areas, to fit as much of Faerun as possible. one wilderness area per 2.5 miles. that is, the areas must be that size <condensed or just that size> and not collide with each other on the world map.] )\n\nnow, since this seems like it'd be hard to implement, I decided to make sure of the following:\n\n1:if it is done, I get credit for the idea\n\n2:For the sake of quality and your own lives, this must be done with a large (at least six members for mechanics, one per area being worked on at a time, and another six for the world map arrangement) team and a long time to program, and test, this wonderful beast. testing must be completely open to others, though changes will be introduced as time goes on and people suggest things and report things.\nWHEW!\n\n3: This must a good mod, at least an eight or above, for you to quit working on fun based improvements. that doesn't make this mandantory, of course. keep improving if you wish, but also keep stamping on those bugs!\n\n4:when a bug is found, you must at least try to remove it, and if this bug leads to a lower score than 8.5, you MUST remove it.\n\n5: it must be very fun to play, alone or with others.\n\n6: when this is released, I don't want to see thousands of versions of this. make your changes easy to import, and have a guy on the team import it.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"167":{"Name":"Journal Export Plugin","Author":"Markshire","Submitted":20070726,"Updated":20070728,"Category":"Applications","Forum Thread":"Link","Short Description":"Transferring journals between modules is a big pain.","Type":"Content Tools","Description":"Transferring journals between modules is a big pain.

Among these is the lodestone marauder, a creature that uses magnetic powers as well as ripping and tearing to overcome its meals... er... foes. And as usual, we know that because one can exist, variants of it can exist in other campaign worlds or planes or places in the campaign world. Variant creatures of this type can even exist in the modern world, or the future world, and there their magnetic powers work especially effectively when disarming foes.\n\nA lodestone marauder is a Large aberration, which gives us a lot of interesting templates with which to work. Five different templates are featured on the variants below; it's sort of a two-template theme month. \n\n\n\nd20 Modern: Fiery Marauder\nA fire element lodestone marauder combines the marauder's potent magnetic abilities with a fiery flair, making for an interesting creature. The element template is presented in Manual of the Planes, and it is adapted for d20 Modern along with the creature.\n\nA fire element lodestone marauder looks like a lodestone marauder, but flames sheath it at all times, causing its metallic-looking spikes to flicker in fire. It resembles nothing so much as some kind of mecha or robot, but it is very much alive. It uses the tactics described for a lodestone marauder, taking advantage of the fact that it deals additional fire damage when it hits and when it is hit.\n\nFire Element Lodestone Marauder CR 11\nLarge elemental (fire)\nInit +5; Senses darkvision 60 ft.; Listen +8, Spot +8\nLanguages --\n\nDefense 24, touch 10, flat-footed 23; magnetic defense (-1 size, +1 Dex, +14 natural)\nhp 115 (11 HD); DR 5/magic; Mas 22\nImmune fire, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, critical hits\nResist stability (+4 against bull rush and trip)\nFort +9, Ref +4, Will +8\nWeakness vulnerability to cold\nAction Points 0\n\nSpeed 30 ft.

The fire does 1d6 points of damage every round that it is burning. Creatures that hit the fire element lodestone marauder with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as if hit by the creature's attacks and must succeed on a Reflex save to avoid catching on fire.\n\nHeat (Ex) When making attacks with natural weapons, a fire element lodestone marauder does 1d6 points of fire damage in addition to the damage from the attacks.\n\nMagnetic Attraction (Su) A lodestone marauder can create a pulse of magnetic energy within a 30-foot-radius emanation that sends metal objects hurtling toward it. An affected creature carrying such an object must succeed on a DC 21 Reflex save or drop the object in its space. Objects fastened down in some way, such as properly donned armor, automatically succeed on the save. At the marauder's option, held or unattended objects that fail this save are drawn in a straight line toward it. Such objects stick to its body, and they can be removed only on the marauder's death or with a DC 21 Strength check. The save and check DCs are Constitution-based.\n\nMagnetic Repulsion (Su) This ability works like magnetic attraction, except repulsion pushes objects away from the marauder within a 30-foot-radius burst. An affected creature carrying such an object must succeed on a DC 21 Reflex save or drop the object in its space. All creatures wearing metal armor or carrying metal shields within the area of the marauder must succeed on DC 21 Reflex saves or be knocked prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n\n\n\nPseudonatural Half-Dragon (White) Lodestone Marauder\nThe lodestone marauder is already dangerous, but add in the white dragon's breath weapon and it becomes a little scarier. On top of that, this creature can change into a tentacled mass of horror that can still breathe cold and use its magnetic abilities. The pseudonatural template is presented in Complete Arcane.\n\nIn combat, this creature uses its magnetic repulsion ability first, then breathes a cone of cold on as many foes as possible, and then uses its magnetic attraction ability to collect the dropped weapons. Then it moves in with claws and teeth until it can breathe again.\n\nA pseudonatural half-dragon (white) lodestone marauder resembles a standard lodestone marauder, except that scales with a metallic sheen cover its skin, and it has great dragonlike wings rising above its back. It can also turn into a mass of tentacles and pseudopods of the same shape and size. \n\nPseudonatural Half-Dragon (White) Lodestone Marauder CR 13\nN Large outsider\nInit +5; Senses darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Listen +15, Spot +15\nLanguages --\n\nAC 28, touch 10, flat-footed 27; magnetic defense (-1 size, +1 Dex, +18 natural)\nhp 148 (11 HD); DR 5/magic\nImmune cold, paralysis effects, sleep\nResist acid 10, electricity 10, stability (+4 against bull rush and trip); SR 21\nFort +10, Ref +4, Will +8\n\nSpeed 30 ft.

An affected creature carrying such an object must succeed on a DC 22 Reflex save or drop the object in its space. Objects fastened down in some way, such as properly donned armor, automatically succeed on the save. At the marauder's option, held or unattended objects that fail this save are drawn in a straight line toward it. Such objects stick to its body, and they can be removed only on the marauder's death or with a DC 22 Strength check. The save and check DCs are Constitution-based.\n\nMagnetic Repulsion (Su) This ability works like magnetic attraction, except repulsion pushes objects away from the marauder within a 30-foot-radius burst. An affected creature carrying such an object must succeed on a DC 22 Reflex save or drop the object in its space. All creatures wearing metal armor or carrying metal shields within the area of the marauder must succeed on DC 22 Reflex saves or be knocked prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n\nTrue Strike (Su) Once per day a pseudonatural half-dragon (white) lodestone marauder can gain a +20 insight bonus on a single attack roll. In addition, the creature suffers no miss chance against a target that has concealment or total concealment when making this attack.\n\nAlternate Form (Su) As a standard action, a pseudonatural half-dragon (white) lodestone marauder can take the form of a grotesque, tentacled mass. Despite the alien appearance, its abilities remain unchanged. Other creatures receive a -1 morale penalty on attack rolls against the pseudonatural creature when it is in this form. \n\n\n\nCorrupted Half-Fey Lodestone Marauder\nThis twisted evil variant on the base creature uses the half-fey template from the Fiend Folio and the corrupted template from Book of Vile Darkness. The combination creates a creature that looks statistically very like the above half-dragon variant if the half-dragon variety were green, but its appearance and effect on the player characters are very different.\n\nThe corrupted half-fey lodestone marauder fights very much like the standard lodestone marauder, since the two templates don't add much in the way of new combat options. However, this variant does have spell-like abilities that it may remember to use at the beginning of a combat (either before or after attempting to disarm the foes of all metal weapons). It doesn't remember its spell-like abilities very often, though, because its experience with them is that foes generally resist the ones that allow saving throws.\n\nThe corrupted half-fey lodestone marauder visually resembles a fey version of a lodestone marauder, which is to say it is more delicate-looking. Its elongated spikes are thinner and more pointed, and its metallic skin appears polished. It also has the butterflylike wings of a fey creature that can fly. All this fey loveliness is twisted and bent and pulled and warped, so that its features are not in quite the right place and its wings look warped, enlarged, and bulbous. \n\nCorrupted Half-Fey Lodestone Marauder CR 13\nNE Large aberration\nInit +5; Senses darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision; Listen +15, Spot +15\nLanguages --\n\nAC 28, touch 10, flat-footed 27; magnetic defense (-1 size, +1 Dex, +18 natural)\nhp 115 (11 HD); fast healing 5; DR 5/magic\nImmune acid, enchantment spells and effects\nResist stability (+4 against bull rush and trip)\nFort +10, Ref +4, Will +8\n\nSpeed 30 ft.

Every place will be detailed enough that it seems like a real place with magic. and since the new content from MOTB will be there to be used, this should provide very unique places to visit. possibly even the ethreal, shadow, and astral planes in a limited radius around easily communicable areas!

I would really like to see more efforts put into this, or an organized project as the tools for it could go so far in many ways toward making really great new concepts in NWN gameplay. \n Mostly what I would love to see, and I hope you too can see the future potential, is a MOD for AI that can allow creatures/mobs to Roam through a level, looting it like players do and using its random loot against the player characters. Alow them to occasionally loot bodies, chests, even their fallen comrades, and use those items. Even if \nthey use them stupidly, it would add massive unpredictable depth to every encounter. \n This is much more important I think than Randomly Generated rooms/dungeons which I think cause more problems and limitations than they help. This simple AI convention is what shines most in Rogue like games I think that give free reign to such unexpected situations and unexpected variables, its why there are so many forums full of stories full of wild experiences in Nethack games. \n\n Random loot and creature spawns would be great too, but the AI is whats severely lacking at the moment from achieve this type of game.\n\n A rogue NPC could potentially wipe out a party of higher lv players purely because of the random loot it may scour and wip out on the live players or it may blow itself up with or curse itself or buff up other creatures with items it finds. It might even help you by accident with say polymorph effect that makes you a more powerful creature randomly.\n\n I just cant experience the kinda thrills in NWN that such a feature could bring to the game. Every time you play you could experience different situations occuring, even though the map doesnt change.

My idea is this- Expand on it.\n\nA secluded but large town in the sword coast has become a popular town for adventurers to get homes. There is a castle, two manors, four small homes (one or two story), and two tenant buildings (ten apartments apiece within) built in this town, and an abandoned home that is not for sale and people tend to stay away from. This abandoned home, thru a secret passage in the basement, leads to an underground metropolis for evil characters, with a market (complete with slavers auctioning hapless non-adventuring residents of the town above). This place has Three evil keeps, three nasty looking manors, six small homes (one or two story) and about 12 slave huts in the market. An entrance to the sewers is near the market in the underground city, and the sewers can be accessed from the aboveground city by means of a great many sewer caps and entrances. Both have markets for the homes, items, etc. The sewers are infested with cranium rats, goblins, and the occasional lizardfolk (intelligent creatures appear in CR ranges depending on average level of people playing). Beneath a demilich's tower within the underground city, there is a massive (eight large interiour areas) dungeon similar in nature to undermountain. As you go from first to eighth level in the dungeon, Drow and Illithid pop up in increased numbers (all intelligent creatures are PC classed, scaling based on average level of players).\n\nMy basic concept here is not only to provide a good RP enviroment, but also to provide hunting grounds regardless of level, and to give the player a reason to play when his friends are busy. it is, however, supposed to be better when there are at least ten players playing on it.\n\nAll data not pertaining to area layouts and design will be saved as one of two things- Database files, and character files (bic).\n\nOf course, to let the mod maker flex his design skills and creativity, I've made sure not to define exact layouts, all creatures, or the puzzles in the dungeons.

It's very difficult to role play different monk orders simply because monks don't have many options.

Bonuses and penalties depending of the order. Such as the peace bringers, they aren't allowed to use quivering palm on the living like normal monks, yet unlike normal monks they can use quivering palm on the undead.

The folks that put it together into the Sexy OC, its addon, and now LCountach's SexyOC MotB Addon, all did us a huge favor, in terms of transforming that artwork into functional use in the OC and NX1.\n\nBut, with the expansion now out, premium modules (or whatever Atari is calling them) on the way, and even more artwork flooding into the vault...it begs the question...\n\nMaybe we should like, get organized about this Sexy OC stuff. One release, everything works together, easy install, easy update.\n\nI have read the readme files of all the authors I could find in the misc files I have, and all of them ask that if their work is used give them credit, and don't charge money. Easy enough. (Although Aleanne, we could charge money for a great number of your things, awesome stuff.)\nSome of the very people that made the original artwork used in the compilation modification are working on new projects or aren't active in the community anymore (*sob*). Those that are, it seems to me, should be active being creative..not worrying about the next version upload. And then there are the people who are going to make the stuff we want to add to it.\n\nIn other words, why a Sexy OC, or even Sexy NX1, why not a Sexy Expansion Pack. The goal of the pack would be to continue to update the OC and NX1 sexy/functionality, but more importantly, also include a hak file made up of community work that could be used by module builders. That hak file would be the real juicy bits. Eventually, the OC and the NX1 will work, and we will run out of characters to re-skin. But a updated hak, that module builders could use, now that would be something...\n\nI know I could make a hak file of the current work, but to me the whole point is to continue to add to the work, and make it more community driven, without increasing clutter on hard drives and doubling up on files for no reason. In addition, I think we would see more submitted creations if the authors can focus on creating and don't have to worry about continueing to update it to make the application of said artwork work on the latest patch. The more I read the threads underneath file submissions, the more I sympathize with these awesome people that take the time to make this stuff, not just for themselves but for us, and then stuggle with not just the occasional rude and demanding person, but have to continually update and correct things that have nothing to do with the artwork, and everything to do with how some files have to be structuared and edited.\n\nI really adore the CEP for NWN1, and while I think its much to early for something of that scope in NWN 2, something like the Sexy OC mod, that applies to so many of the community, could only be a good thing.\n\nI personally am not an artist, nor a modeler. In fact, my understanding of the toolset application is pretty limited. I am however great at organization, and that brings me to my point.\n\nIf I were to take all of the work from the Sexy OC contributors, make a clean and full \"camapaign/expansion\" version for the overide folder, and then a .HAK version for module builders/players, and then update them as new contributions were being made, would people want that? Would the authors mind? Would people make new stuff to be contributed? Would people like LCountach continue to focus on technical addon type files that make it all work?\n\nSee, I am volunteering to be the Managing Editor...I am simply not capable of the artistry or techical skills that the authors themselves have. But if those same authors are willing to work with me, I will make sure a functional, streamlined, and continually improving sexy community expansion is up and available for download.\n\nI would love to hear from people on this, and I am sure that while in my little world this a new idea, if I looked hard enough someone else has either had it or is working on something similar. I really want to hear from the people who are still working on projects pertaining to the Sexy OC/NX1 addon or projects that COULD be. I want to get a feeling for interest from contributors before I dedicate myself to doing it. The simple reason for that is that obviously, for a bit less work, and a lot less responsibility, I can make this work for me at home. I believe however the NWN2 community needs this. Not just to make a very cool idea bigger and better, but because the community as a whole could benefit from more universal projects. The CEP exceeded everybodys expectations, but I think the coolest thing it did was bring the community's creativity together in a \"it all works together\" package, and it did that from its first release. We need that here. Badly.\n\nPS:\nWould I want to add things like companion multiclassing, custom models, etc? Well, of course! But one goal at a time. First Sexy and Functional, then we can worry about Sexy and Uber! :D\n\n-corrandk\nemail me directly at xii_corran@hotmail.com\n\n","Rating":10,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"207":{"Name":"OC improvements","Author":"BePower","Submitted":20071101,"Updated":20071102,"Category":"Script","Type":"Alternatives","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"I enjoy the OC, and there are a few simple ideas that could improve it's replay value (if anyone could do it, that is):\n1.

It's more of a side story to the Bhaalspawn story in the previous games. Below is a small part of the story. Comments are very welcome as well as more ideas of how to make this idea more original.\n\nPlayers begin a slave on a ship bound for Calimport. They no nothing of who there parents are as they were abandoned on the streets of the city of Baldur�s Gate where they scrapped to survive. At the age of 7 they made the mistake of trying to steal from a Red Wizard who was quick to apprehend the small thief and sell them into slavery.\nAfter years of being sold from one owner to the next the player was finally sold off to a ship owner who trades slaves. Once in Calimport the player is bought by a kind, but firm man known as Aaron Guiln, a wizard of no small renown.\n\nOver the years Aaron taught the player to read and write. Taught them the value of honor and trust. Over the years the player and Aaron formed a bond and the old wizard began treating the player like a father, finally removing his title of slave and making him keeper of his estate.\n\nBut like all things it changed one night. Dark visitors arrive at Aaron�s estate seeking the PC, speaking of a debt of blood that must be paid. Weather protecting his property or his love for the player Aaron fought the assailants as best he could but in the end was defeated, but not before Aaron teleported the PC to a safe location away from the Dark Messengers.\n\nThere PCs met a woman by the name of Emona. A young thief who had been in Aaron�s service for many years. She will join the PC to help him avenge Aaron and get to the bottom of what is going on.\n\nFrom this point PCs must discover who these Dark Messengers are and what debt of blood they are speaking of.\n\nI hope to incorporate a complete romance and personnal reputation system. NPCs will have schedules and I hope to have player action consequences incorporated as well. This is a personnal project and in no way related to Dark Isle or Bioware's previous works.

This is most obvious in a maze like map.\n\nNow this becomes more troubling if one is doing the interior of a multi-leveled structure. I am currently working on the interior of a dwarf-infested mountain. Its difficult to provide the illusion that the areas are actually stacked on top of each other when you can see them adjacent in game. \n\nI thought perhaps a tile could be made to act as a buffer between neighboring rooms/halls, so that players can not see the shapes of the neighboring areas before they get there.\n\nCurrently, I have to buffer by up to three rows of tiles so that players can't see into neighboring areas, though if its a taller tileset, then I have to use even more of a buffer. This of course wastes space by inflating the interior map size.\n\nI could break it down into smaller maps, but am trying to minimize the number of transitions our players have to use.\n\nSo if this new tile idea could work, it could potentially allow one to save interior map space and keep inter-map transitions to a minimum.\n\nI suppose we could use some sort of placeable (such as a sign), tint it pure black, adjust its height and width to match the application, insure that fade=1 on the placeables.2da, and manually place it to use it as a divider between tiles.

If you are stuck for other players to party up with or just need to pad out the missing numbers of a party then Companions would come in very handy.\n\nI myself am building a PW and would very much like to include the option to hire companions, however I have come to realise, that as it stands at the moment it is too tricky and impractical.\n \nAt the moment, as far as I am aware, the party roster system was not designed with PW�s in mind. I don�t think it can be configured to limit the amount of Companions a party or player can have. As a builder it would be ideal to have some sort of power over this. Otherwise you could end up with fewer players hording all of the Companions and leaving people in need without. Also parties could end up far too large and cluttered, if a party of several PC players each hired several other Companions! The exploits could be horrendous.\n\nAnother handy thing would be good maintenance/clean up scripts for when players die, crash or log out of a server. Ideally the Companion will need to be teleported back to where it came from so that other players can recruit them if the other player does not return for them.

Its the most unique and competitive Warcraft mod ever made, and has some of the most addictive and complex gameplay you will ever experience. \n But it would bring a whole new 3D graphical splendor to that gameplay by building it in NWN2 toolset which it seems capable of supporting. Note that this is not a RTS style of gameplay, as each player only controls 1 of 90 hero choices (8 players max) and maybe any pets that Hero can summon. No building is required other than building up your character through the match and buying gear to make it more and more powerful.\n Here's a basic rundown of DoTA gameplay from the DoTA wiki:\n \n Defense of the Ancients pits two teams of players against each other: the Sentinel and the Scourge. Players on the Sentinel team are based at the southwest corner of the map, and those on the Scourge team are based at the northeast corner. Each base is defended by towers and waves of units which guard the main paths leading to their base. In the center of each base is the \"Ancient\", a building that must be destroyed to win the game.\n\nEach human player controls one Hero, a powerful unit with unique abilities. In Allstars, players on each side choose one of ninety heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes. The scenario is highly team-oriented; it is difficult for one player to carry the team to victory alone. Nevertheless, some heroes, given enough time, can change the outcome single-handedly, while countering the opposing team's heroes. Defense of the Ancients allows up to ten players in a five versus five format and an additional two slots for referees or observers, often with an even number of players on each side.\n\nBecause the gameplay revolves around strengthening individual heroes, it does not require one to focus on resource management and base-building, as in most traditional real-time strategy games. Killing computer-controlled units earns the player experience points; when enough experience is accumulated, the player gains a level. Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage it can inflict, and allows players to upgrade their spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource: gold. The typical resource gathering of Warcraft III is replaced by a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing hostile units, base structures, and enemy heroes. Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities. Certain items can be combined with recipes to create more powerful items. Buying items that suit one's hero is an important tactical element of the scenario.\n\nI would like to see some interest in this idea and maybe form a group to discuss how this can be done. Im not a mod builder, but its been a fantasy of millions to see DoTA gameplay put into a more graphically pleaseing engine than WC3. You can bet the new Starcraft engine will be used to create a DoTA style game, but a more RPG system like NWN2 will be much better for this. If that gameplay could be duplicated, then such a mod would easily become the most popular and wide spreading NWN mod ever, and possibly bring in millions of players and attention to NWN in general not that it really needs it. If there's any interest from some good mod designers to start a forum topic about this. I'd love to be apart of it. If so email me at puppethead23@yahoo.com Or Ill look through forums here and start such a topic if theres a message board.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"336":{"Name":"BCK II Blueprint requests","Author":"Ivendar De'Vir","Submitted":20080701,"Updated":20080701,"Category":"Other","Type":"Request to be created","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Hi people,\n\nwhen looking for haks to build castles and cities I noticed Nytir's BCK II pack that seem to give really great possibilities in building.\n\nLink\n\nUnfortunately not everyone is such skilled in architecture and people like me with less skill and a bit laggy toolset have bad chances to build up even the most basic things with it.\n\nSo I'd like to request if some people would help out and do blueprints for the BCK II, especially Castle stuff like walls, towers, gates and such.\n\nTupoun for example have build such things once and they look really great on his screenshots of a retexture pack he did, but unfortunately he told me when I asked that this work is lost since of a Pc crash.

While it would be impossible to properly create far realm areas or tools to do so, I have a couple ideas that may bring some of the insanity-causing fun to NWN2.\n\n-Psudonatural stuff\nA visual effect that allows superficial (texture level) changes to creatures (allowing for, for instance, a naked, hairless creature with eyes in odd places), custom wings, and custom tails come together to allow for the creation of psudonatural creatures. common tails/wings are groupings of tentacles in normal state or odd shapes composed of tenticles (say wings of worm-looking tenticles). Furthermore, a real template for it (using abilities present in NWN2), and a model which mirrors the image of a psudonatural form present on page 47 of \"Tome and Blood\".\n\n-Kaorti models and scripts\nBasically, models, scripts, and toolset creatures (with description) that form Kaorti (armored and unarmored) that look like the pictures in the Kaorti entry of \"Fiend Folio\". That act (game mechanics and abilities wise) similarly to Kaorti in PnP. And that have an ACTUAL DESCRIPTION that matches the fiend folio entry's.\n\n-Kaorti experiments\nModels, scripts, and creatures for both examples of Kaorti experiments using non-humanoid subjects. One of these is called a skybleeder. the other looks like a corrupted scorpion. Both are also in fiend folio. similar abilities and mechanics to their entries, similar descriptions.\n\n-Ribbon daggers, Resin, and Kaorti Resin armor.\n\nModels, textures, and (in the dagger's case) animations of the above. ribbon daggers grant the disarm feat.\n\n-Kaorti Cyst tileset and placables\nA tileset of a Kaorti cyst, and placables (chairs, resin blockages, resin-crusted doors, etc.) to go within. This, when combined with the above things, allows quests such as following strange creatures back to their lair, then entering and finding a book that drives the character mad if he fails a will save (as information visually forces itself into the mind after he accidentally reads a passage aloud.)\n\n\nSo far, so good. but there are other assorted odds and ends that may be nice.\n\n-book: Unsettling thoughts.\nThis is a book written from the perspective (and, in the modules it is contained in, considered to be written by) a person who unwittingly enters the far realm. at the end of the book, it becomes almost unreadable. The book cannot be dropped (the character is sort of under a compulsion to keep it)\nand resting cannot happen when you possess it (memorable and unsettling, though that last part may not be possible without the script being used for a global module \"onrest\" script. Ie, check for that item tag and interrupt resting when it is detected, on rest).\n\n-Painting placables\nPaintings of parts of the far realm, painted by an artist unlucky enough to go there. Good subject matter includes the fleas coming from barriers, the denizens, or memorable areas, such as the settlement lashed securely on a rock from a failed colonization attempt into the far realm. Memorable folk within, such as the elf with spiders for brains, are also good.\n\n-Gauntlet hands (cursed)\ngauntlets that are identical to the \"naked\" hand image, save that they have an animated eye on the palm. this eye moves and blinks. (not sure if this one is possible). These are cursed for two reasons: The eye would be irritated by putting on gloves or gauntlets, and you can't remove an eye from somewhere without leaving a socket and causing pain.\n\n\nThese three add the ability to do \"mildly altered\" humanoids, paintings for alienist gatherings, and make your character unable to rest or drop the book that caused it.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"369":{"Name":"Classic Glaives","Author":"djbeast","Submitted":20081013,"Updated":20081014,"Category":"Applications","Short Description":"Don't you miss the classic glaives from D&D?","Type":"Request to be created","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"I love NWN2, but there are still some things missing to get that all D&D feeling. \nThere are some weapons in the game that just arn't there and of course one of my all time favourites was not there, the Glaive.\nRemember?

It combines elements of stealth, warfare, and deception.\n\nIt is fairly long, so thanks if you read it all the way through. It's been running through my head for a while. -grin-\n\nI'm fine if you don't like it, but if that's the case then please use constructive criticism and tell me where I went wrong so I can change it when I actually get to work on the project.\n\n'When friends become enemies, they don't forget each other. That was the case with you and Arter Koul, that man you once called a brother-in-arms.\nThat was, until he stole something that so many people wanted, so many people like you.'\n\nSetting:\nThis is a custom setting, in a world known as Alluvia. It is a relatively simple place, the world is vast and only one continent, known simply as Alivaan, has been discovered.\n\nTwo powers, the magic-supported city-state of Emilyre and the vast military nation of Illume fight for control over the area, but that is not what matters to the PC...\n\nThe player takes control of one of three covert soldiers in Emilyre's 1st Assault Division. The campaign begins with them sneaking up to the Illumineze Imperial Palace under the cover of an attack, attempting to assassinate the Illumineze King Elkin IV.\nThey do accomplish this task (with some great covert action along the way to help support the troops), and takes the 'liberty' of looting his bedroom, where they find three golden wedges that fit into a small disk.\n\nJust as the PC is reading a note that they find along with it, their two comrades enter the room, one of them asking what the disk is. The character reads the note aloud, revealing that it is in fact the key to the tomb of King Elkin I, which was buried in Emilyre when the two nations were whole, before civil war tore them apart.\n\nOne of the comrades, who happens to be Arter Koul, tries to snatch the disk, only succeeding in grabbing one piece, and the PC and the third comrade, Mali Caubourne, fight the traitor, but he escapes after they defeat him, still in possession of the disk third. Mali, apologizing, swipes a second third, leaving the PC with only one.\n\nJust as they escape, several soldiers enter the room and overwhelm the PC. What is happened is not revealed until the start of the first chapter.\n\n----------------------------------------\nChapter 1:\n\nIt is three years later, and the player has, in fact, survived the ordeal. A lot has changed though: the three old war buddies have grown rich off their military pays and quit as to gain an edge against their new enemies. Each has gathered up a following of thugs, thieves, and assassins, and they are now all warring with each other amongst Emilyre.\n\nThis chapter is supposed to be very in-depth, with the PC commanding raids on enemy properties, stealing from them, and at the same time preventing the from achieving these goals.\nAt some point, the player gets word of Koul obtaining a third of the disk from Mali, causing him to team up with the PC.\nEventually, after a long while of missions and fun raids, Arter Koul himself leads an attack on the player's manor, finally acquiring the last piece of the disk and escaping. It's not over yet however, and the PC follows Arter, witnessing him opening the tomb.\nThat's when it is revealed: the grave was not sealed to protect what was inside, it was sealed to protect what wasn't. There is a huge surge of energy as the crypt opens, and both men are knocked out.\n\n----------------------------------------\nChapter 2:\n\nWhen the PC comes to, the city is in flames, and filled with black garbed fanatics who are torching the buildings and gutting the citizens. Additionally, the PC has changed: their body has become twisted and dark, and their mind is filled with visions of flames and fury. Whilst trying to escape the city, they witness several encounters between the 'blackcloaks', speaking of someone called the 'Count of Catastrophe'.\n\nEventually, they catch a glimpse of the marauding leader, whose servants refer to him as 'Misfortune' and 'Count'. They also notice that his bodyguard are twisted with the same curse as the PC, and witness him grabbing a running hostage by the neck, who then transforms into one of the beasts.\nThe Count then shouts, \"Back to the hells, and let us drink to my return!\"\n\nThe player eventually makes the connection and seeks out Elkin's heir, Prince Vidi, who has rebuilt the palace during the passed three years. To do so they go 'undercover' as a soldier, in the hopes that they will be knighted, however things are complicated when they are assigned to a border frontier known as Verdant Hold, a bastion of defense against invading orcs. The player must ascend the ranks of the Illumineze military, and eventually achieve knighthood.\n\nIn the chapter finale, the player meets the Prince and exchanges word with him, revealing their true identity. It so happens that the Prince hated his father, as his dream princess lives in Emilyre, and he asks only one thing in exchange for helping you kill The Count and hopefully remove your curse, he wants you to kidnap her.\nApparently only a single district of Emilyre was set to flame, more as a warning than an act of war, and the girl, Princess Miosine, is alive and well in the Royal District.\n\n----------------------------------------\nChapter 3:\n\nYou are teleported near Emilyre by Vidi's archmage (but not into it due to the powerful magic it harnesses). This part is like a big stealth mission where you can't be seen (since the PC looks like one of the Count's soldiers). To put it simply, the player sneaks through the districts, using any means neccisary to avoid patrols, and must then infiltrate the Emilyran stronghold (which is very large and full of dangerous defense mechanisms like golems, traps, alarms, ect.) Eventually you find the Princess in her room, but end up spooking her, causing her to call for the royal guards, in which case you grab her, and use a vial of magic dust the archmage gave you to teleport yourself back to the Prince.\n\n----------------------------------------\nChapter 4:\n\nThe Prince is pleased, and lends his entire military force to you in order to wipe out the Count. He tells you that while he doesn't know its exact location, a huge volcano nearby started to billow blue and purple smoke just after the attack on Emilyre, he suggests you look there.\n\nThe Count is indeed in the volcano... surrounded by a huge black city which they must assault. Using a special communication device, the PC can command troop divisons to attack certain places, sit back and defend the main force's flanks, and guard your siege engines. Additionally, the Princess, seeing your cause to be just, calls upon several Emilyran archmages to aid the assault.\n\nThis battle, like everything, is meant to be very realistic. Your force will retreat to their camp between attacks, at which points the enemy may try to outflank you, or you may command a night mission. During an attack there will be constant dangers to both sides, including arrows, siege weapons, magic, and a bloody fray between your force and the defenders in the battlefield. You will constantly recieve reinforcements, and can order artillery strikes at certain points.\n\nEventually, a siege weapon will breach the enemy wall and your soldiers will pour in, overwhelming the enemy and charging towards the volcano. There is then a loud roar, and the Count of Catastrophe emerges from its depths in a powerful demon form. At this point, your soldiers begin fighting his last elite force with your support, until the Count begins to worry and retreats into his haven, summoning up a barrier that will allow only his cursed minions to enter.\n\nAll seems lost, until a young soldiers points out the fact that you are also cursed, meaning that you can pass through the barrier. So you do.\n\nYou sneak through a network of volcanic vents, avoiding the Count's elite soldiers, and eventually walk out into the center of the volcano, where you see... nothing.\n\nThen he appears, arising from beneath the blue magma at the mountain's core, standing waist-deep in lava. He beckons you over, then you fight.\n\nI won't reveal the details of the fight, or the ending, but be sure that I have them all planned out. -evil grin-","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"379":{"Name":"Improved inspection key?","Author":"maiart","Submitted":20081124,"Updated":20081124,"Category":"Other","Type":"Additions","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"Can someone improve the quick inspection fonction that higlights interactive items and characters that way:\n- make title of item/character appeat appear above it whant highlighted with Inspection key (for now, it appears only when wursor is on that precise item/character)\n- add a Quick inspection key lock.\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"380":{"Name":"Smaller party bar for SoZ?","Author":"Zonzai","Submitted":20081203,"Updated":20081203,"Category":"Other","Type":"Request to be created","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"I was wondering since the previous incarnations of smaller party bars are no longer being updated somebody could throw out a quick stand-alone smaller party bar.\n\nAlternatively, if you wanted to explain how to do that I'd be willing to take a look at it myself.

Here I present an alternative idea for much the same effect.\n\nIf a model of an armour piece for a bracer were made that had a shield attached (purely visually), then it would be possible, using the toolset to create or modify suits of armour, to wear this while wielding a spear normally (with no shield or second weapon) and appear to be using a spear+shield while using the two-handed thrusting attack animations, instead of the usual ridiculous slashing attacks you get with monkeygrip.\n\nObviously for symmetry reasons, pairs of gauntlets could not be produced to create this effect. However, using the toolset it is possible to create custom armour that features assymetrical bracer arrangements, whereby a left hand bracer featuring a \"shield\" could be created.\n\nThis would be perhaps a less elegant solution than somehow getting the PC to use the animations NPCs get to use, but what can I say, to me (and I'm sure others), the ability to play a spear+shield using character - even if only in appearance - is important.\n\nThe main downsides would be that there would in fact be no shield (or shield bonuses) conferred, and the spear would be in fact wielded as a two-handed weapon, though to some extent these could be considered to cancel each other out. Monkeygrip would not be necessary to appear to be using spear+shield, but then, single handed spears should in truth exist in the game anyway. Finally, to use this option the PC would have to use custom armour specifically designed to use this bracer model.\n\nNot being a modeller myself, I can only speculate as to the difficulty involved, but I would assume that existing shield models could be in a sense pasted on, perhaps reducing the amount of work to be done. If that is the case, then ideally a selection could be produced based on the standard and some of the excellent custom shield models.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"382":{"Name":"More FX birds & animals","Author":"Viconius","Submitted":20081215,"Updated":20081215,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"FX birds of the expansion are just a begining...","Type":"Request to be created","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"With SoZ we have ravens and some exotic birds as effects to place on the rooftops.

They believe other races to be beneath them, at best slaves and food, and at worse doormats. The Daeijine Illithids are a bit more subdued in their arrogance, not being the dominate race of the land (much to their chagrin) but use what leeway they do have to maximum effect.\n\nThe Daeijine Illithids are highly individual to all save their Elder Brain. Loyality to an Elder Brain is paramount and sometimes groups of illithids will fight each other if their rival Elder Brains decree it.\n\nSome illithids are wanderers and are not connected to any Elder Brain, be it via exile, or some other mishap. These illithids are treated with suspicion by others as their minds cannot be seen as clearly as other illithids within their collective.\n\nPhysical Description\n\nThe illithid is a grotesque being, humanoid in form though thin and gaunt, with purple slimey skin and a squid for a head, equiped with four tendrils. Their mouths come either in lamprey or beak form, and their eyes are white and without pupils. They are hermaphrodites, their only gender being by sheer personality.\n\nYoung illithids start as tadpoles with squid heads and grow inside briny vats until puberty at age 9-11, where they grow the rest of their human body and limbs, and can walk outside freely. The spawn must be cared for, lest they mutate into one of the several aberrant paths of life for an illithid.\n\nRelations\n\nIf allowed, illithids do not get along with others, they dominate others. Daeijine illithids are in a position of great control by the other races, and thus they, being pragmatical, choose to work with others. If this control were ever upset they would be glad to retake their positions as 'the superior race'.\n\nAlignment\n\nLawful Evil is the most common, and other alignments become less common from there. A chaotic good illithid is almost unheard of. This alignment is re-enforced if it lives with an Elder Brain, for it is wise that their alignment matches that of the Elder Brain.\n\nLands\n\nIllithids shun light and enjoy damp areas. They live underground in human caves and by underground water reserves. If ever seen on the surface they wear robes to shield themselves from the sun and avoid drying out.\n\nReligion\n\nIllithids do not have a religion and the generic ilithid is an atheist, dedicated to the Elder Brain alone. The Elder Brain is thus their god as it is the key to their immortality.\n\nLanguage\n\nIllithids are telepathic and do not speak, their actual voice consisting of disturbing gurgles, rumbles, and hisses. It is a special form of telepathy in that it does not automatically grant ability to understand and communicate with others, and it has a range much like vocal speech... its only difference being that the 'sound' is not sonic based but mental equivalents. An illithid knowns Common and Undercommon and may know a host of other languages, especially if they have eaten many brains.\n\nNames\n\nIllithids have a true name, which is unspeakable and more of a mental signature, and a name which is used for communication. That name varies greatly.\n\nRacial Traits\n\n * -2 Strength, -2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma\n * Medium: As Medium creatures, illithids have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.\n * Illithid base land speed is 30\n * Darkvision (Ex): Illithids can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and illithids can function just fine with no light at all.\n * +2 racial resistance against mind effecting and charm.\n * Imunity to sleep.\n * Keen sense: Able to use full search even when only doing passive search.\n * Spell resistance equal to 11+ character level.\n * Skill affinity: +2 Search, Listen & Spot.\n * Light Blindness: You are not used to the strong light in broad daylight, and without daylight adaption you will suffer penalities to rolls.\n * Racial Spells: Darkness, Light, See Invisibility.\n\n * Favored Class: Wizard.\n * Level Adjustment: +2 \n\n\nIt shouldn't be any problem to make it real, I just haven't found what the problem is that causes my Mindflayer not to have ECL+2 and look like a Dryad.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"425":{"Name":"Item Appearance Soz Update","Author":"Rashkae","Submitted":20090827,"Updated":20090827,"Category":"Applications","Short Description":"Item Appearance Soz Update","Type":"Additions","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Someone should adopt the abandoned Charlie's Item Appearance change to create a SOZ edition that includes the new SoZ much improved weapon models.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"426":{"Name":"Nwn2 cursors","Author":"djbeast","Submitted":20090907,"Updated":20090908,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"NWN2 cursor for windows","Type":"Request to be created","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"I have been trying to find the NWN2 cursor for use in windows for a while now and I have also looked at possibilities for ripping it out of the game, with little luck.

I thought I would repost it here as well. I did not categorize it under scripting here because it involves more than scripting.\n\nHere it is:\n\n\"Ok, I haven't fully tested this yet. However, I have been working on this idea for some years (since NWN1). I \"think\" I may have a solution for some types of controlled flight. The problem is, I am neither an accomplised modeler nor scripter and I think the solution will require both. I am a thinker though, so here goes:\n\nFirst. IF you can use a 3d model as a visual effect, then model your bird/dragon/aircraft/spaceship and import it as a visual effect.\n\nSecond. Create a \"creature\" model that is a very thin and simple invisible body with a \"head\" that is a simple planar model (square/triangular/doesn't matter) that has a hook point for \"hair\" (I think I read somewhere that this is how they do ponytails and other long flowing hair effects?). Make the creature non-collidable and import it into game. I think the best effect would be had if the model is a very short body so that the visual effect appears to be on the ground before being manipulated (this should allow your flyer to land).\n\nThird. \"hook\" your visual effect/flyer to the \"head\". Not sure how this is done, but I assume that you select your visual effect as the \"hair\" for your creature. (as a technicality, I don't know if this has to be done in 3ds/etc before importing the creature, or if this is simply done in a creature 2da file, but I suspect the latter and I am sure all you experts know which it is). \n\nFourth. Manipulate the \"height\" of the visual effect with a script that \"scales\" the creature along the z axis. Flying elevation is then adjusted up or down via the script and possible player input if the player were the flyer and a script can also read some sort of keyboard input for up and down.\n\nI know that in the toolset I can manipulate the scale of an orglash or other air elemental and it does not distort the visual effect portion's size or shape, but if you do the same for a creature that isn't made up of a visual effect, you end up stretching the creature to the point of being unrecognizable. For the air elementals/orglash's though, the height adjusts.\n\nA couple of problems to overcome, but I think are doable: \n\n1) each increment in scaling when I scale it manually using GF's useability tools (I think that is what I was using) makes a progressivly larger jump in height (is this because the scaling is a fixed percentage basis and as it gets taller each increment, the next percentage scaling necessarily becomes a larger amount?) which causes movement up to be less smooth, in fact it isn't smooth at all. However, if you can script the scaling so that it scales in smaller increments to start and then lowers the percent of scaling for each increment, then with a little playing around you might be able to make the scaling cause the effect to scale up in height in a smooth and more fluid manner.\n\n2) You'll have to figure out how to \"animate\" your visual effect if you don't want it to look too fake, some of that may be able to be done in the visual effects editor instead of 3ds (and the problems importing the animations that would entail), but I dunno, as I stated I am neither a modeler nor a scripter, just a thinker.\n\n3) As the conversation above discusses, you'll have to figure out if you will still just live with the walkmesh issues on your area, or if you will force it to all walkmesh and block for non-flyers through some triggers and scripts and blocking models, etc.\n\nLet me know if you guys think this general concept is doable and if any of you are able to get it to work, I would request a small credit for the concept and hopefully a you'll post it up for the community to see how to use it and do it.\n\nI'll be really interested to see any input on this idea and if my explanation isn't clear enough ask me for clarification on the idea.\"","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"429":{"Name":"New Familiars and Animal Companions","Author":"Kunikos","Submitted":20091021,"Updated":20091022,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"New Basic Animals, Elemental/Planar/Undead type Familiars and Companions","Type":"Additions","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"I think it would be great if someone expanded the variety of basic animals available for choosing for familiar and animal companion.

Im offering this idea because while to some PC gamers WoW is their anti-christ, but im sure many many many many people would enjoy these weapons. Ugh... now that the rant is done, i guess im gonna make a list of the swords and pictures for visuial. \n\n\nXXX Greatswords XXX\n\nAshbringer\nAshkandi, Greatsword of the brotherhood\nArmageddon\nVengeful Gladiators Decapitator \nCorrupted Ahsbringer\nEdge of Agony\n\nXXX Bastard Swords XXX\n\nThunderfury, Blessed blade of the Windseeker\n\nXXX One handed XXX\n\nTitanguard\nRune-etched Nightblade\nBlade of savagery\n(ect.)\n\n\nI think you get the point, Lots of fun swords and, if its at all possible making a HAK, and override? as well, making them fully tintable would be amazing. like, i would do special \"favors.\" XD\n\nI hope someone will read this and be willing to take my idea into consideration! :) \n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"435":{"Name":"Forgotten Realms PW","Author":"Gilraak","Submitted":20091111,"Updated":20091112,"Category":"Applications","Short Description":"Forgotten Realms PW Idea","Type":"Complete Adventures","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Alright, so while surfing the vault, I had found an amazing remake of the City of Baldurs Gate and part of Icewind Dale.

DISCLAIMER Due to a lot of people (read: most of you) being prejudice, I will explain the inspiration for this mod at the end this entire message. Please do not base your opinion about this mod just because you dislike the show that it is based on. I want to address again that it is based on and not exactly like the show. There will be some elements in the mod that are straight from the show but the storyline is completely different and I am not going to try to recreate that story line. This mod is called �Nindou, Your Ninja Way�, so it is the story that you create for yourself.\n\nThe Hakpack:The hakpack adds several things to NWN2 regarding the character creation as well as allot of other custom content. \nThe Race: The race is a requirement for the mod, if you enter with any other race you will not be able to graduate and your whole gaming experience on that mod would end there. So this is a requirement in order to play on the mod. The race is called �Shinobi� which is just another word for a �Ninja�.The Sub race: Once you have selected your Race you will be able to select the Sub race. The sub races in this mod are indicated by the countries of which there are 10 of in total. Each country has its own element and their names hint towards that element. They all start with �The Land of �� and then their hint. These are: Sand, Leaves, Mist, Clouds, Waterfalls, Snow, Grass, Rocks, Sounds and RainThe Class: The class is called �Ninja� and this is yet again a requirement. All the items that are within this module are restricted to the ninja class. This class has elements from several classes in it. The classes being used are the: Monk, Wizard, Sorcerer & Cleric. \nMonk: The monk is being used as the base class for the Ninja class. The reason for this is because the fighting style of the monk in unarmed combat (as well as some armed combat animations) look far more elegant then the clunky moves of a fighter for example. Wizard: The style that is being used from the wizard is the spell learning from scrolls. The spells in this mod are called �Jutsu�s� and these can be written on scrolls for later generations or other Shinobi of course. The ability to learn from scrolls is depending on two things however. First, you must have the level required of course, but second and most importantly, if the jutsu that you are trying to learn is an elemental or medical jutsu, you must have the required domain in order to learn the jutsu. Sorcerer: Unlike the wizard class, the sorcerer class does not use a spell book where you have to memorize the spells you want to use. The sorcerer has a certain amount of times that a spell can be cast, and the Ninja class uses that same ability. Also, the wizard uses the Intelligence attribute for its spells. The Ninja uses the Charisma attribute like the sorcerer does. Cleric: The domains that the cleric uses is the third element that the Ninja class uses, You will be able to select a total of two domains with the level capped at level 20 and you will be able to learn a third domain once the level cap is increased to level 30. The first domain will be available at level 5, the second at level 10 and the third domain will be available at level 21. The domain you select will determine which jutsu�s you can learn. The Deity: The deities is not a requirement of course but if you do not select them you will be depriving yourself from some special spells/features/skills. These skills are linked to each of the clans and every clan has a different spell or feature or skill available to them. Each country has 2 main clans. The Spells/Features: All the spells and features that are available to the Ninja are renamed and some things will be completely new. These are classified into three groups: Taijutsu, Ninjutsu and Genjutsu. For the complete lists of all the jutsu�s can be located at the �Jutsu�s� category.\nTaijutsu: All the features that are being used by the Ninja are renamed and classified as �Taijutsu�. Features often increase physical or mental combat prowess which is exactly what Taijutsu does as well. Ninjutsu: The offensive spells available are all slightly renamed and are classified as �Ninjutsu�. Genjutsu: Defensive spells, like the offensive spells are also slightly renamed and these are classified as �Genjutsu�. The Domains: The domains are not available at the character creation. They will only be available to the player twice, the first time is at level 5, this is where you will start with either your first element or your career as a medical ninja. At level 10 you will be able to select either a second element or get medical training. There is an option to select a third element but this is only available at level 21. The level cap is currently level 20 and might be increased at a later date. \nCharacter Creation: When you create you character you are required to select the Shinobi Race. You are free to choose from a Sub Race, these represent the countries. This is to determine where you will be (re)spawned. The class you are required to choose is the Ninja class. This is in order to give everybody the same options and to keep the gameplay of the mod in tact. The deity you select depends on the country you chose earlier, they represent the clans of the selected country and each clan comes with its own advantages. There is only one spell you can select at the character creation, this is a variant of the spell �mirror image� but rather then floating balls circling around you there will be actual copies of your character. These copies/clones are deprived from the �Flame Twin� spell� without the flames and a lot weaker. The reason for this single spell is because it is required in order to graduate from the academy.\nAttributes:(General Information) All of the information about the attributes is generally known by the most people. If you are familiar with the attributes you can skip this part. If not, please read on as to see what the attributes will do in the mod.\nStrength: (STR) Strength measures muscles and physical power. It affects melee attack & melee damage. The stronger you are, the more weight you can carry reducing encumbrance weight. Shinobi with a lot of strength usually have a harder time connecting to an opponent, but when they do connect they do significantly more damage. Dexterity: (DEX) Dexterity measures agility, reflexes and balance. It affects AC, reflex saving throws, ranged attack, and many skills. Shinobi with a lot of dexterity are usually harder to hit and they usually are able to hit an opponent much easier than a strength shinobi. But due to the lack of strength they also deal less damage with each hit.Constitution: (CON) Constitution represents health and stamina. It affects hit points, fortitude saving throws, and is used to determine endurance. Shinobi with a lot of constitution can take a whole lot more damage than low constitution shinobi. Due to their massive increase in health they are quite useful in combat. Although uncommon, high constitution shinobi who can take a whole lot of damage as well as dish out. Intelligence: (INT) Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. It affects skill points (if it is a positive modifier). If your INT is too low (below 9), your character acts mentally challenged. Highly intelligent shinobi can distribute more points between their skills. This can make them more adept in more skills than shinobi that lack the intelligence to comprehend that many skills. Wisdom: (WIS) Wisdom describes a willpower, common sense, perception and intuition. It affects will saving throws. Shinobi that have a lot of wisdom can be much harder to kill if they use this along with dexterity. Due to their wisdom they have a better understanding of the human body. This results in an increased chance to dodge and evade attacks from other shinobi. Charisma: (CHA) Charisma measures force of personality, persuasiveness, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. It affects many diplomatic skills (Persuade, etc.). This also determines how hard it is to evade your jutsu�s because the charisma attribute determines how high the DC is of your spells/jutsu�s and how often you can cast your spells/jutsu�s per day. Shinobi with high charisma are usually very reliant on their spells/jutsu�s and lack the actual Taijutsu (physical combat) skills. \nThe World: This mod takes place in a world dominated by Shinobi (ninja�s). In this world there are allot of different factions and each faction wants to be the strongest one. Your place in this world is that of an Academy Student that is about to graduate after 8 years of training. That said, there are around 440 exterior areas that you can explore in. Each of those areas is 32x32. Of these areas the majority is a neutral area where the only real law basically is �Survival of the fittest�. There are also 10 countries in those 440 areas which count from 18 to 25 area�s per country. Then there is one area reserved for the admin, the so called �limbo�. \nThe Countries: As said there are 10 countries, each of which being controlled by a faction and utilizes one out of five main elements.\nLand of Sand(Specials: Undead Summoners & Expert Trappers) The Land of Sand is located in the South Eastern part of the world.

The Shinobi from this country use the Wind Style as their main element. Their capitol is located in the Eastern part of the country with the entrance facing to the West. Home to the Fuma clan and the Kaguya clan. They are allied with the Land of Snow and the Land of Rocks, but are hostile to the Land of Rain and Land of Leaves. Land of Grass (Specials: Magical & Animal Companions) (wolves only) The Land of Grass is located in the Western part of the world.

Their capitol is located in the Western part of the country with the entrance facing to the East.

Their capitol is located in the Central part of the country with the entrance facing to the South. They are allied with the Land of Snow and the Land of Mist, but are hostile to the Land of Sound and Land of Sand. \nThe Styles: There are six styles being used in this mod; Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth, Water and Medical. Each style has its strong point, but, as with everything, it also has a weak point. Characters that select their first element receive a �damage immunity� to one element, and a �damage vulnerability� to another element. For example, a fire style user is strong against a wind style user, but weak against a water style user. This means that the fire style user gets a damage immunity +50% towards sonic damage, but a damage vulnerability +50% towards cold damage. Fighting as a fire shinobi against another fire shinobi would usually be fought in normal battles without any spells/jutsu�s. Of course it would still be possible but you would not really do much damage with it. So as a fire style user, the top 3 worst possible enemies would be 1: Water Style, 2: Fire Style, 3: Earth Style. \nThe Villages: All the countries have their own capitol village, the name of these villages correspond with the name of the country. The Land of Grass for example has the �Hidden Grass Village�. All of the villages start with �Hidden� even though they are the capitol cities. All of the cities will have the same identical facilities but of course will have a different layout. There is not a single village the same. Each village has a headquarters, hospital, police station, jutsu shop, Armory, temple, food shop, bank, academy and of course an arena. \nHeadquarters: At the headquarters you will find the village �elders� and the village leader, this leader is called the �Shadow�. The shadow represents the country/village and is named accordingly. The shadow for the Hidden Rock Village is called the �Rock Shadow�. This will be a NPC and will never be controlled by an admin, no matter what. The reason for this is because this is the NPC that you get your missions from. Hospital: In the event that you are beaten in combat by someone or something, you will be re-spawned (unless resurrected) at the hospital of the village that you are from. Should you be a rogue ninja you won�t be re-spawned at the hospital of your origin village but at the police station from the village the person who killed you is from. In other words, if you are a rogue cloud ninja and you get killed by a leaf ninja then you will be re-spawned at the police station of the Hidden Leaf Village even if you were in a different country. If you are hospitalized you will get a message stating that someone had found you unconscious and noticed the symbol of the village that you are from and brought you to that village. The only item you would have left on you is the standard armor/cloth and unless you have any money left at the bank you would have to earn some to get new armor/items. Police Station: If you are a criminal Shinobi and you get caught/killed you will end up at the police station of the ninja that killed you. As stated at the hospital, if you are killed by a leaf ninja as a criminal ninja you will be re-spawned at the police station of the hidden leaf village. You will be given a penalty of course for being a criminal, this penalty will be in the form of some jail time. The maximum jail time that can be received is 60 minutes, the minimum jail time is 10 minutes. Since you can only become a criminal ninja by killing one of your own village or from an allied village the severity of your jail time depends on what exactly you have done. Jutsu Shop: The Jutsu Shop is obviously the place where you can purchase your spells/jutsu�s. the available jutsu�s will depend on what the country� native element is. The countries with the fire element would be the only countries that are able to sell high level fire jutsu�s. countries with the earth element would be the only countries that are able to sell high level earth jutsu�s, and so on and so on. This does not mean that they do not have any jutsu�s of another element. Each jutsu shop has access to all the elemental jutsu�s up until level 4. If you are a water style ninja but your home village is the hidden leaf village, you would need to travel to a neutral/allied water element village in order to receive the level 5 to 9 water jutsu�s. You can select 2 elements with your character so you will have to travel to another country in order to learn the higher level jutsu�s. Armory: In the armory you will be able to sell found weapons and armor but more importantly you can also purchase new weapons and armor. All items sold in the armory will not be enchanted with super elite enchantments but will all be very basic. Fights will have to be won by skill and not by �who has the best items�. There are only a handful items that are slightly more powerful then the items sold at the armories but these are scattered throughout the world and are not being sold at armory so don�t bother to look for these items at the armory. The items that are being sold rely on the level you are, the higher the level, the better the armor. There are a total of 20 different items per item type, each one corresponding to a level. Temple:The temple is a place of peace and harmony, there are no �no pvp� area�s on the server with the exception of the academy interiors, so you can start a fight in the temple. But it is strongly advised to prevent any violence inside the temple. It will be a village regulation that the temple will remain serene, but it is not a server rule!!! So you are allowed to do so if you wanted to. The temple will be used for ceremonies, being marriage, graduation, trials or funerals. People cannot CK (character kill) each other, CK�s can only be performed if you request it for your own character! Food Shop: At the food shop you will be able to of course purchase food. There is a limit as to how much food you can take with you. You can carry a total of 5 food items and 3 drink bottles. You can also pouch for food but each item fills up a food slot, so if you have 5 food items with you already then you wont be able to carry anything else. If you use up a bottle with a drink you will receive an empty bottle that you can fill up at any water location. This would be �unpurified� water and needs to be boiled first. It does however take up one drink slot, so if you have 1 bottle of any drink, one empty bottle and one unpurified bottle of water, you still have 3 slots filled and in order to use the unpurified water, you would need to boil it first This can be achieved by using a campfire, you can also use this campfire to cook any food products that you are carrying with you as �raw� things don�t tend to be very healthy for you. You will not be able to use any food or drinks during combat. Bank: In order to use the bank you would first require a bank account. You can receive a bank account by purchasing one from the banker NPC located inside the bank. As soon as you receive a bank account you will only be able to deposit gold into that account. It is a bank account and not a safety deposit box after all. Each time you want to deposit any amount of gold you will be required to talk to the banker NPC and each time you donate money you will be required to pay 10% tax fee to the bank. The minimum amount of gold that you can deposit will be 10 gold pieces of which 1 would go to the bank. And for everybody who thinks that they have the genius idea of robbing the bank, don�t bother, the ninja world isn�t about robbing banks. If you want to rob anything, kill someone and ransack their corpses. Academy: This is the starting location for everybody that enters the mod for the first time. Upon entry you will be able to read everything you are required to know about the mod and in order to leave the academy you will have to undergo an exam. This exam exists of casting a clone jutsu �Mirror Image� and as soon as you do that you will be able to receive enough experience to leave the academy. You can only leave the academy when you are level 2 and once you left you can never get back inside as there is no need to do so. Everything that you can read in the academy is also located in your journal and can be accessed by you at any given moment in order to re-read anything you might have forgot. Note that the regulations of the server will also be written at the academy and in your journal and if you leave the academy you are assumed that you know the rules and abide by them. Any disregard for the rules will be punished harshly. Arena: If you have any dispute with someone, but you don�t want to be thrown into jail for it, you can challenge one another in the arena. If you die there you will not lose any items or gold, just your dignity. The challenge can be viewed by anyone that wants to but do be careful that you do not accidently kill someone that�s watching or you might be arrested for it. If the person entered the arena during the fight you could go free, but if that was not the case you might get a small jail time. If someone enters the arena during a fight that person can get jailed for quite some time. If a person that�s watching a fight decides to help either one of the fighters then that person is also arrested and jailed for quite some time. The arena will also be the staging area of official tournaments, however, this is not going to be located in any village but at a neutral area to everybody. Unofficial tournaments can be organized by anyone really. Just keep in mind that things don�t escalate into an all out war between several factions that might be enemies and keep an eye out for any party crashers. \nThe Housing: Everybody in the entire world of Nindou can rent a house. Yes, rent, the reason why I won�t allow to purchase houses/properties is because when people stop playing on the server, then they would still have the key to that house. Now, it is of course easy to replicate a key but if the original owner does come back then he would still be entitled to that property since (s)he still bought it. If you would have rented then you would not be entitled to that property since the lease would have been terminated. The second reason for renting rather than purchasing is that it would be a lot cheaper to obtain a house. There will be around 50 houses per village, this means that an additional 500 area�s will be added to the mod just for the interior of the homes. It goes without saying that all 500 of them would use the same layout since I am not going to create 500 individual interiors. Each house will have its own �Mailbox� to which people can leave messages. \nThe Mailbox: When you are offline I want to try to still make you involved with the rest of the mod even though you�re not there. To do this I�ll try to create a mailbox system. Whenever the door of your house is locked and you don�t have a key to open it you will get an option to either �leave the door alone� or to �leave a message�. When you do want to leave a message you can just type a message and sign it with a name or leave it anonymous (handy for extortions or abductions to write your demands in :P). when you are finished writing your message, then as soon as you pressed enter it will end up as an envelope inside the house. When a resident enters his home the first thing he will then step on is a bunch of letters (the pile of letters just indicate that there is mail, it does not indicate the quantity of the mail, so in one pile could be 1 or 100 letters and the pile would still be the same amount of letters). \nThe Clans: Each capital village will house 2 clans, these clans are pre made and are led by NPC�s. this is to prevent a \npower struggle among players and to prevent people from bossing other people around. The current list of \nclans is: Aburame clan, Akimichi clan, Fuma clan, Hyuga clan, Inuzuka clan, Kaguya clan, Kamizuru clan, \nKedoin clan, Kohaku clan, Kurama clan, Nara clan, Nagama clan, Sarutobi clan, Senju clan, Uchiha clan, \nWagarashi clan, Wasabi clan, Watari clan, Yamanaka clan and the Yotsuki clan. Yes, these names are \nJapanese names but I honestly could not be bothered with thinking of English names, plus, the martial art \n�Ninpo� is originated in Japan. In the fallowing list: \nAburame clan The Aburame clan is native to the Hidden Leaf Village. Their special ability is to manipulate insects and can therefore use several spells that use insects. The Aburame and Kamizuru are the only clans so far that has a visual effect given to their clan members. The visual effect is as if bugs are flying around them. Akimichi clan The Akimichi clan is native to the Hidden Rock Village. Their special ability is that they can increase in size and thus their strength and constitution. They deal more damage, have more health and take more damage as well. But being bigger doesn�t always mean that it�s better. Fuma clan The Fuma clan is native to the Hidden Sound Village. Their special ability is an increased effectiveness with the shuriken weapons. When the character is created they will receive �Weapon Specialization: Shuriken� and at level 10 they receive �Greater Weapon Specialization: Shuriken�. The weapon specialization feature is not available to normal players. Hyuga clan The Hyuga clan is native to the Hidden Cloud Village. Their special ability is that their sight and hearing is improved greatly. When the character is created their spot and listen checks are automatically increased to 50. When the player reaches level 10 they also receive the spell �True Seeing�. The true seeing spell is unavailable to players outside the Hyuga clan. Inuzuka clan (wolf) The Inuzuka clan is native to the Hidden Grass Village. Their special ability is that only their clan can summon a pet dog to help them in battle along with some special skills to help them in battle such as �magic fang� and �jagged tooth�. These clan members are the only ones that receive the �Animal Companion� skill. At level 10 this skill will turn into the �Epic Animal Companion�. Kaguya clan The Kaguya clan is native to the Hidden Sound Village. Their special ability is that they are as tough as a bone� really, they are. Straight from the first level they receive the �Bone Skin� feature which increases their AC. At level 10 they receive the feature �Tough as a Bone�. Which makes them immune to most Genjutsu�s. Kamizuru clan The Kamizuru clan is native to the Hidden Waterfall Village. Their special ability is to manipulate insects and can therefore use several spells that use insects. The Kamizuru and Aburame are the only clans so far that has a visual effect given to their clan members. The visual effect is as if bugs are flying around them.Kedoin clan The Kedoin clan is native to the Hidden Mist Village. All other Shinobi can learn how to create a clone from someone else using the �Glass Doppelganger� jutsu/spell. The Kedoin members however have taken this jutsu to the next level. Their clones are three times as strong as the clones that everybody else can create by using the �Shadow Simulacrum� jutsu/spell. Kohaku clan The Kohaku clan is native to the Hidden Sand Village. Their special ability is to �Create Undead� creatures to help them in their battles. When they reach level 15 they can �Create Greater Undead� creatures to help them. The type of undead creature depends on their level. Kurama clan The Kurama clan is native to the Hidden Rain Village. Their special ability is an increased effectiveness with the long swords. When the character is created they will receive �Weapon Specialization: Long Sword� and at level 10 they receive �Greater Weapon Specialization: Long Sword�. The weapon specialization feature is not available to normal players. Nara clan The Nara clan is native to the Hidden Snow Village. Their special ability is that they are very adept with the use of medicine and thus gain an increase in the �Heal� skill. This skill upon character creation is automatically set to 50. Unlike medical ninja, the members of the Nara clan can use the heal pack during combat. Thus is the only known clan that can heal during combat. Nagama Clan The Nagama clan is native to the Hidden Rain Village. Their special ability is an increased effectiveness with the greatswords. When the character is created they will receive �Weapon Specialization: Greatsword� and at level 10 they receive �Greater Weapon Specialization: Greatsword�. The weapon specialization feature is not available to normal players. Sarutobi clan The Sarutobi clan is native to the Hidden Leaf Village. They are a devout clan that believe in a �Higher Purpose�. This believe allows them to channel holy power into their weapon of choice granting them a +5 enchantment bonus on attack and damage rolls and an extra 2d6 divine damage against evil alignment opponents. They also receive a jutsu resistance of 16 points and if they connect with an opponent they have the ability to dispel any positive effects on that enemy. Senju clan The Senju clan is native to the Hidden Grass Village. Their special ability is that they can imbue their weapons with a magical attack damage. Unlike the Sarutobi clan with their divine damage, this magic damage applies to everybody it hits, good or evil. At level 10 this damage will be increased, granting their clan members the �Greater Magic Weapon� jutsu. This clan is the only clan with the ability to cast this jutsu. Although it is impossible for non Senju clan members to cast this spell on their weapons, the Senju can cast their special ability on other people effecting their main hand weapon. Uchiha clan The Uchiha clan is native to the Hidden Mist Village. The members of this clan are very adept in reading the movements of their opponents. This allows them to instantly know what jutsu�s they might use and will be able to counter these jutsu�s preventing their opponent from using them. They gain a +50 bonus to their �Spellcraft� and their �Tumble� skills. Wagarashi clan The Wagarashi clan is native to the Hidden Rock Village. Their special ability is an increased effectiveness with the Short swords. When the character is created they will receive �Weapon Specialization: Short Sword� and at level 10 they receive �Greater Weapon Specialization: Short Sword�. The weapon specialization feature is not available to normal players. Wasabi clan The Wasabi clan is native to the Hidden Snow Village. Their special ability is an increased effectiveness with the Katana. When the character is created they will receive �Weapon Specialization: Katana� and at level 10 they receive �Greater Weapon Specialization: Katana�. The weapon specialization feature is not available to normal players. Watari Clan The Watari Clan is native to the Hidden Sand Village. They are famed for their ability to trap people. With this ability they are able to not only place intricate traps but they can also disarm traps and collect them so that they can use it themselves. The members of this clan receive a +50 bonus to their Trap skills and a +20 bonus to their Spot skills. Yamanaka clan The Yamanaka clan is native to the Hidden Cloud Village. Members of this clan are very adept in the use of genjutsu, to such an extent that they are immune to pretty much any genjutsu cast on them. There are only a few skills that would prevent them from moving. However, at level 10 they receive the �Freedom of Movement� skill and at that point it would be very hard to snare them into anything. Yotsuki clan The Yotsuki clan is native to the Hidden Waterfall Village. They believe that the moon is the ultimate source of power as it shifts the tides of the entire world. Being from a water style country/village they seem to pray twice a day to the moon, at high tide, and at low tide. This believe enables them to use a skill called the �Moonbolt�. This skill zaps away the strength of their enemies and subsequently makes them more prone to knockdown as well as making them do less damage in combat. \nThe Groups: As mentioned before there are also criminal Shinobi, more of which will be mentioned at �Ranks�. These Shinobi are allowed to create bands or groups. One such a group may exist out of a maximum of 5 players. It is possible to be allowed to have more player slots within your group, however, you would need a really, really, REALLY good reason for this to be allowed. Stating the obvious by saying �Because I need it for my group.� Is NOT a good reason. Groups will have a custom mission, this mission will always be ranked as an �S-Rank Mission�. More about the mission ranks will be mentioned at �Missions�. Currently there are two groups active within the mod. The �Akatsuki�, and the smaller �Seven Swordsmen�.\n Akatsuki: The Akatsuki has a total of 10(!) members. The members of this group, as with any group, can be from any country. The special mission that these guy�s have is that they seek power. In order to do this they need so called �Demon Beasts�. These beasts however use a human host called a �Demon Host� and they are very strong themselves due to the power that the demon gives them. More about the demon hosts will be mentioned at the �Demon Hosts�. Once they have found a demon host they need to kill it in order to capture the demon essence. This demon essence will give anyone who owns it increased power. If one would own all 10 demon essences they would be a lot stronger then the normal ninja�s. the Akatsuki either travel alone or travel in pairs but never more then two akatsuki members will be traveling together. Seven Swordsmen: The Seven Swordsmen has a total of� you guessed it, 7 members. This group is also searching for power but they go about it in a completely different way. They are searching for special swords. As the normal swords have no special powers and do not increase at all (unlike the armor that players can purchase) these swords would be very special. There are 10 swords in total, more of which will be mentioned at the �Weapons and Armors�. Each sword not only gives additional power to the user when it�s in their inventory, but they add even more power if they are equipped. If someone would own all 10 swords then that person would be a lot stronger then the normal ninja�s. The seven swordsmen never travel together and even though they are in the same group, they are all bitter rivals! They all want the power for their own and unlike the Akatsuki, they don�t want to share it with anyone, not even their own group members. So fights between group members to gain a sword is absolutely not unheard of. \nThe Demon HostsThe Demon Hosts are always NPC�s, their personality is always friendly and can be very hard to detect just who a demon host would be as it could be a normal citizen of a village or a wandering drifter who just appears occasionally. Needless to say finding a Demon Host is a unique feat on its own. Upon being attacked they will of course become hostile to the attacker but they will always retain their human form. Thus you will never see some huge goat or �man-bear-pig� running around. There are 10 of these demon hosts in total and each one is located at one of the 10 countries. There will only be one demon host at a time and only one demon host per country. So if you killed a demon host in the Land of the Leaves then you won�t need to look for a second demon host in the Land of the Leaves. This means that the first one is the hardest one to find because it can be in any of the 10 countries, but it would be relatively easy to kill. But that also means that if you found 9 of them already, you would know (if you kept track of it) in what country the last demon host would be. Even though it would be relatively easy to find, it would also be the hardest one to beat. In the next graph I will try to give you a clearer view as to the powers of these demon hosts.\n1st Demon Host (Fire & Lightning Style) At level 21 and with two elements with all of its jutsu�s, this one would be the easiest demon host of them all, but also the hardest one to find. 2nd Demon Host (Wind & Earth Style) This demon host is at level 22 and like the 1st it has two elements with all of its jutsu�s. this one would already be harder than the 1st due to its level increase. 3rd Demon Host (Lightning & Water Style) The 3rd host is a level 23 NPC with yet again two elements at its disposal with all its benefits. And due to its level increase should be a little harder than the 2nd. 4th Demon Host (Fire & Earth Style) The 4th demon host would be harder to defeat. Because of the 24th level it has additional features added and with the two elements it might be very difficult5th Demon Host (Wind & Water Style) At level 25 this 5th host is the last demon host with only two elements, due to its level it has additional attribute points which makes him tougher than the previous host. 6th Demon Host (Fire, Wind & Water Style) The 6th demon host is the only demon host with 3(!) elements available with all of its benefits. This alone makes it harder to kill and with level 26 it will only be harder7th Demon Host (Fire, Wind, Earth & Water Style) At level 27 and with 4 elements to its disposal the 7th demon host is the first host with no weaknesses to a particular element but can exploit the weakness of the players. 8th Demon Host (Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth & Water Style) This demon host is the first one to utilize all five elements, it has no weaknesses and can exploit the weakness of any enemy. At level 28 this is one tough cookie! 9th Demon Host (Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth & Water Style) The 9th demon host has the same abilities as the 8th host, however, unlike the other level increases, at level 29 this host is twice as strong as the 8th demon host. 10th Demon Host (Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth & Water Style) The 10th host is the last host and even though it�s relatively the easiest one to find, it�s the hardest one to crack. At level 30 its 10 levels higher than any player could be and \ncould be seen as the big brother of the 9th demon host, but the only real difference is\nThat it is twice as strong as the 9th demon host rather than the 8th demon host. \nThe Ranks: There are several ranks utilized in Nindou, all ranks will be listed below but not all of them will be available to the player.\nAcademy Student (Level 1) When you enter the mod for the first time you will be spawned at the village academy. In here you can \nread everything you need to know about the mod including the regulations of the mod. You will have\naccess to �E-Rank� missions which can be gained from the Academy Examiner near the exit of the\nacademy. You must take the mission in order to graduate/leave the academy. Low Class Ninja (Level 2-4) When you leave the academy you will gain enough XP from the E-Rank mission to turn level 2 and \nthus become a �Low Class Ninja�. With this new rank you are able to receive �D-Rank� missionsMedium Class Student (Level 5-9) As soon as you turn level 5 you will be ranked as a �Medium Class Ninja� and you would be able to\nselect your first style. You will also be able to receive the �C-Rank� missions. High Class Ninja (Level 10-14) Once you become level 10 you will gain the rank of �High Class Ninja� and select an additional style\nThat you want to use. You will gain access to the more interesting �B-Rank� missions. Elite Class Ninja (Level 15-20) At level 15 you will turn into an �Elite Class Ninja�, this is the level that most players will stay on. \nThey get access to the �A-Class� missions and in addition they could receive �S-Class� missions as wellANBU Black Ops (Level 20) The �ANBU Black Ops� can only be obtained if you are level 20. This however is on invitation only! \nThe reason for this is because this rank is reserved for the Admins of the mod. Village Shadow (NPC) The village shadow is a representation of the village itself and is named after it. The �Hidden Leaf \nVillage� for example would have the �Leaf Shadow� as its village leader. This is the only place where\nyou can get your missions from with the exception of the academy examiner. Rogue Ninja (Level 1-20) Anybody can become a �Rogue Ninja�. They are the criminals of the mod and can be hunted down by \nthe Elite Class Ninja�s if ordered to do so. You can become a Rogue Ninja by killing one of your allies\nin battle. This can be either a NPC or a PC, the only thing that matters is that it has to be an ally.\nRogue Ninja�s can also form groups and create their own missions. These missions, if approved, will\nalways be an �S-Rank� mission. \nThe Missions: There are a lot of different types of missions, the difficulty of the missions can be categorized into 6 groups. These rankings are �A�, �B�, �C�, �D�, �E�, and �S� with S being the hardest and E the easiest. You can never receive a mission that is above your level, but you are able to receive a mission that is beneath your level. This means that an Elite Class Ninja can still receive a D-Rank mission for example. All of these missions can be gained by talking to the Village Shadow (with the exception of the E-Rank mission).\nE-Rank: There is only one E-Rank mission in the entire mod and there is only one person that can give this mission to you. The examiner of the Academy is also the only person other than the Village Shadow that can give a mission. The mission is a requirement in order to graduate and after your graduation you will never be able to do this mission again. Upon completion you will receive enough experience to turn to level two. This is where you would turn into a Low Class Ninja and access the next tier of missions. D-Rank: The D-Rank missions are missions that are ridiculously easy to perform and thankfully you won�t have to do these missions for a long time. These missions do have a purpose however. They are all performed inside the village that you spawned in. They are all to let you get to know the village layout. These missions are usually collect or delivery missions. Once you turn level 5 you will be able to access the C-Rank missions which should be more interesting. C-Rank: Once you are level 5 you will be able to get C-Rank missions, all of these missions are so called �National Missions�. They are all outside of the village but still inside the country. These missions can vary from inspecting a certain event/person that resides inside the country. The purpose for these missions is to familiarize yourself with your country, try to discover secret routes and the fastest ways to get from A to B. B-Rank: When you reach level 10 you will get more interesting missions. All of the B-Ranked missions are International missions. These missions can vary from delivering messages to an allied country� Village Shadow to assassinating Ninja�s from other non-allied countries. All of these assassination targets will be NPC�s but don�t think that all of them will be push-overs just because they are NPC�s. Some might be much stronger then you would think. A-Rank: A-Ranked missions are available to you once you reach level 15, These missions are Global Missions, this means that the mission can be located anywhere in the world. The missions are mainly assassination missions but can also be espionage missions and the like. Unlike the B-Rank assassinations, the A-Rank assassinations will only exist out of actual players. These do not have to be rogue ninja�s, they can be neutral ninja�s or of course enemy ninja�s. They will never be allied ninja�s for obvious reasons. S-Rank: There are two ways to get an S-Ranked mission, the legal way, and the illegal way. The legal way is when you turn level 20, you will receive a so called �Bingo Book� and anyone that is inside that bingo book is subject to be killed. All of the players listed in the bingo book are of the Elite Class rank and the bounty on their heads is quite substantial. The illegal way is to turn into a rogue ninja and create your own mission. These �self created missions� must be requested at the forum of the mod and must have a good depth regarding to RP. If you want to destroy your home village for example you would need a good reason for doing so. By saying �Because I want to kill everyone in it� is not a good reason of course. \nThe Bingo Book & Bounty Hunters: The fallowing two items are unofficial missions. They provide the player with information about shinobi with a price on their head\nBingo Book: When you turn level 20, be sure to talk to the village shadow. You will be given a �Bingo Book�. In this book is the information of all the Elite Class Rogue[/b] Ninja�s. Their name, age, sex, height, style(s) (if known), home country/village, bounty on their head and of course, the last known location the person has been sighted. If you search the world for these Elite Rogue Ninja�s and if you manage to kill them you could turn out to become quite wealthy. The trick is to find them. The skill is to kill them.Bounty Hunters: Elite Class Rogue Ninja�s (lvl 15+) can visit a Bounty Hut which are located throughout the entire world at several locations. You can only access them if you know where to look and they might be located right underneath your noses and are only accessible by rogue ninja�s. The rogue ninja�s do not have a bingo book but they don�t need it either because they are most likely in it themselves and suicide is such a waste. They instead talk to the �Bounty Banker� and they can purchase a contract. Each contract will always be worth more then what it cost if you complete the contract. Otherwise it wouldn�t be worth going through the trouble of completing it. This is the criminal counterpart of the �Bingo Book� but you can only carry one contract at the time. The contract would yield the same information as the bingo book would give but instead of the Rogue Ninja�s, the targets are Elite Ninja�s (non criminal). Again, the trick is to find them. The skill is to kill them. \nThe Weapons and Armors With the level cap at level 20 there are 20 different types of armor available to the players, there is one for each level that the player can achieve. With each level increase comes an additional armor bonus. The armors will be colored in the same color of your native country. You can only purchase your country� armor at your country shop. Throughout the entire world there are several places where you can purchase different armor looks but they will always have the same stats so it�s purely visual based. Some rogue groups can request custom armor looks but again, they will always have the same stats so it would just be visual based as far as requests go.\nNot every weapon in NWN2 will be available in Nindou. Currently the only weapons that will be added are: Gauntlets, Shuriken, Throwing Knives, Daggers, Kama�s, Short Swords, Long Swords, Greatswords, Bastard Swords and Katana�s. All of these swords will be kept at their standard value and will not be improved by enchantments of any kind with the exception of 10 unique swords. These unique swords can have a different color but most of them would look completely different and unlike the normal swords, these swords will have a visual effect added to them. \nThe Summons: In this mod there are, of course, creatures roaming around. It is possible to talk to a select few of these creatures. As soon as you sign a contract, it�s a contract for life and you won�t be able to talk to any other creatures every again apart from your own creature. Once you sign a contract with the creature of your liking you will gain a special �summoning jutsu� skill. Summon Familiar will be added to your repertoire of jutsu�s. As of yet there is no fixed list of how many creatures can sign a contract or what these creatures would actually be. Each creature will add additional bonus to your skill points but only when it�s summoned. Unsummoned creatures will not give these bonuses for obvious reasons. \nTraveling: The entire mod will be quite large. With a total of 432 exterior areas, each of which in the size of 32x32. That said it might be quite time consuming to travel from one side of the world to the other. In order to enhance travel on the mod you will be able to move like the �King of Shadows� and sort of teleport to a location that you click on to travel to. This does not need to be an object, targeting the ground works just as well. When you click you will move to that location quite fast� just like the King of Shadows and leave a black trail behind yourself. In order to prevent abuse of this skill during fights, you will not be able to (ab)use this skill when there are enemies around. This means of travel can greatly shorten the time it would take in order to get from point A to point B. \nThe Mod & Inspiration: After all this I am sure that the fans of the series know exactly what it�s about, for everybody that does not know what this mod is based on, it�s based on an Anime Series called �Naruto� & �Naruto Shippuden�. There are quite a few elements of the series implemented into this mod like the elements, animal summons, clan and village names. But I would like to remind everybody that this mod is based on and not exactly like the series. The storyline depicted in the series is completely different than that of this mod. As said before, this mod is called �Nindou, Your Ninja Way�. So not the way of the series, your way. I hope that there are more than two or three people that would like a persistent world like this and as far as I�ve seen there currently is none quite like it. If I�m wrong about that please do let me know hehe. \nThe Leveling Progress:In this next scheme you are able to see in what manner players would level up and when they get what. Each level also yields skill points and since that is being added with each level it�s not necessary to implement it in this scheme. Even though you are able to select a style while you are leveling, you won�t be able to select any spells/jutsu�s from that style during your leveling. You can learn these style spells/jutsu�s from scrolls. These scrolls will be available at the �Jutsu Trainer� for a very hefty price but then again, they are special jutsu�s and can be life savers. This also means that if you are poor you would probably never be able to learn new spells/jutsu�s. Each jutsu will have a certain requirement in order to learn them. Strangely enough, some elemental jutsu�s will be displayed as �cantrips� even your level is far higher than a cantrip level as soon as you can learn elemental jutsu�s. This however is just to display where the spell will be located at when you�ve learned it. NOTE: from level 21 to 30 is going to be added in the future, the level cap as of yet is on level 20.Level 1: Spell\nLevel 2: Feature\nLevel 3: Spell\nLevel 4: Ability PointFeatureLevel 5: Domain/StyleSpellLevel 6: Feature\nLevel 7: Spell\nLevel 8: Ability PointFeatureLevel 9: Spell\nLevel 10: Domain StyleFeatureLevel 11: Spell\nLevel 12: Ability PointFeatureLevel 13: Spell\nLevel 14: Feature\nLevel 15: Spell\nLevel 16: Ability PointFeatureLevel 17: Spell\nLevel 18: Feature\nLevel 19: Spell\nLevel 20: Ability PointFeatureLevel 21: Domain StyleSpellLevel 22: Feature\nLevel 23: Spell\nLevel 24: Ability PointFeatureLevel 25: Spell\nLevel 26: Feature\nLevel 27: Spell\nLevel 28: Ability PointFeatureLevel 29: Spell\nLevel 30: Feature \nThe Henchmen:Sometimes during your travels there just aren�t that many people around to form a party with. Whenever this happens you can talk to the Village Shadow if you can receive additional Henchmen. You have a total party limit of 4 players (including yourself). This means you can add an additional 3 henchmen to your group and have them fight for your cause. There are 6 type of henchmen that you can take with you, one for each style. Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth, Water and Medical Style shinobi. Whenever you�re at the Shadow�s HQ you can always fire a ninja and hire a new one. Do remember that the more henchmen you take with you, the more money you lose on your missions. The mission yields a fixed amount of money regardless of how many people work on it. If a mission would give 100 gold, and you performed the mission with a 4 man party, then each ninja would get 25 gold. Firing your party before you accept the reward will not be possible. You can only fire a party member if you do not have any mission active at the time. Player party members also cannot leave the party if there is still a mission active. Logging out would result in you not receiving the reward. Rogue Ninja do not have access to henchmen.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"439":{"Name":"Implement Discipline Skill","Author":"Troy","Submitted":20100108,"Updated":20100108,"Category":"Script","Type":"Request to be created","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Anyone who's looked through the 2da's knows that obsidian at one point planned on having the 'Discipline' skill work in game, but for whatever reason it was removed.\n\nHas anyone ever tried to build/complete this?

One morning her mother the dragon calls her and asks her to fetch some candy for her at the local store.","Type":"Plot","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"These are the memoirs of [character name], a young [race] lad/lass who was thrusted into the world of dragons after being adopted by one of the prismatic variety. \nIn this chapter [name, we�re gonna use Amiwyn Pendragon] is sent to fetch his/her mother some candy. A simple task, but then nothing can ever truly be simple for one with an adventurer's luck.\n\n(Journal Entry) You know, I am probably one of the strangest products to ever come of a plague. Even though my entire family was rather forcibly removed from their lives, luck and good blessings seem to follow me wherever my dainty feet may tread. Shortly after my loss I thought that perhaps I should take to a life of thieving in order to feed and clothe myself. My first mark was that of a rather brightly dressed halfling who, as I would learn later, just happened to be a prismatic dragon that had sporadically decided it was much too lovely of a day to spend it in her cave with a bunch of smelly kobolds. Not being a chromatic dragon, I suppose, tends to make one very good natured and it seemed that my attempt at petty theft amused her enough to wish to speak with me. Now I was a chatty child and it didn't take much for her to prod out of me my entire life story, or what I had acquired of one in my last seven years or so, which in retrospect was probably a bit more than any normal girl my age. Well, she took a liking to me and decided that I would make a rather fine pet. Like most rich old women she taught me to perform, put me in cute clothes to show off to her friends, and soon started to think of me as a rather weak, fleshy, wyrmling. I don't mind, really. I get pampered, I'm never left wanting, and all she asks in return is that I perform simple tasks for her undying affection. If only those simple tasks were ever as simple as they should be. Like just today mom called me to her little part of the cave�\n\n(Description on little animal companion that the PC can have join them) This is obviously not THE Bahamut; mom just likes to name her pets after ironic political icons.\n\n(Things would be done in a storybook perspective, with quotations and narration. It�s done in a first person perspective so the narration can have personality. It also allows for more gender neutrality.)\n\n\"Amiwyn!\" Morovia calls me over expectantly. I know this can only mean one thing. \"Ami, will you be a dear sweet little fairy dragon and do me a favor, hmmmm?\"\n\"Sure thing, mom.\" I smile.\n\"Oh wonderful!\" Morovia squeals and clacks her shimmery pink claws together. \"I seem to have run out of candies. Could you go to the store and pick up some more?\"\n\"What? That's it? No epic quest for some magical item or scheme for vengeance against another dragon?\"\n\"Well do you want to quest for some magic item?\"\n\"Well, yeah.\"\n\"Ah, okay.\" Morovia sits up taller and deepens her voice. \"Adventurer!\" She booms. \"I have a quest for thee. Goest thou to thine store and purchasest me thine candies. Thou wilst be rewarded handsomely for thouest effortestnessistsee.\" She lowers her head and her sweet breath huffs near my nostrils. \"How's that?\"\n\"It's fine, mom.\" I sigh.\n\"Yay!\" Morovia springs upright again. \"You know I always fancied myself an actress.\"\n\n(PC would then leave the cave, which is filled with shiny and spiffily dressed kobold minions. One of which would set her up with a way to teleport back to that part if the cave, much like a stone of recall from NWN1. She would then proceed outside. In the woods she would encounter Autumn, a dryad.)\n\n\"Ami!\" Autumn calls out to me and I feel as if a soft breeze is pushing me towards her. \"There you are!\" She laughs as she runs up to me. \"You won't believe what I've found!\"\n\"What is it, Autumn?\" I ask with a polite expectancy. Least I'm pretty sure it was polite. I never was all that good at that sort of thing.\n\"Well, I woke up this morning and my tree was covered in glitter!\" The dryad chittered excitedly. \"I climbed to the top when low and behold I saw that the branches were just filled with fairy dragons.\"\n\"Fairy dragons?\"\n\"Yes! Apparently they were quite fond of the nectar the flowers on the top of my tree make.\"\n\"Apparently.\"\n\"And guess what else! They weren't just regular fairy dragons!\"\n\"Oh no?\"\n\"No! They were special fairy dragons!\"\n\"No kidding.\"\n\"I'm not!\" She squealed and the entire forest seemed to squeal with her. \"These faerie dragons can bring back the dead!\"\nMy mock interest suddenly turned into the real thing.\n\"What? Really?\"\n\"Yes! Really! Anyway, I thought to myself. I'll bet Ami could use a faerie dragon that can bring back the dead.\"\n\"I could!\"\n\"So I asked one of them if they would lend you their services!\"\n\"And?\"\n\"They said no.\"\n\"Well then where is this story going?\"\n\"I did get a few to agree to help if they could have more nectar.\"\n\"So did you give it to them?\"\n\"No!\" She grabs my by the shoulders excitedly.\n\"What?! Why not?!\"\n\"Well what good would it do you when it isn't summer anymore?\"\n\"Well none, I suppose.\"\n\"That's what I thought! So I bottled a ton of nectar!\"\nShe waited for my response as I waited for her to continue. This took a little while. Then finally she spoke again.\n\"I figured that you could carry some around and when you die you can break the bottle and the faerie dragon would come bring you back!\"\n\"If I'm dead then how am I supposed to break the bottle?\"\n\"Oh. I hadn't thought of that...um...I guess just try to land on it.\"\n\"Swell...\"\n\n(With this done the PC would then proceed to the nearest town. I had plans on her encountering the minion of the local shadow dragon who has it out for Morovia and is thus tasked with killing the PC. The minion is meant to be the romantic interest of the PC and will either be male or set to be the opposite gender of the PC. Whatever the case the minion ends up stealing the candy and the PC is supposed to go on many glittery and fluffy adventures to either get it back or find more as that was the very last shipment of Morovia�s favorite to that particular town and all the others she travels to gives her the same story. Eventually she ends up at the gnomish village that makes the candy to find out that the shipments stopped because the shadow dragon is terrorizing them and keeping them from making more. The last violent encounter with the minion (remember, love interest, that�d be littered into this story too) would then happen and she would try to get him to give the candy back, but he would admit to have tossing the candy into a lake shortly after stealing it. He would either admit this apologetically or cackling with his dying breath depending on if the PC decides to just kill him. After that the PC defeats the dragon through either force or diplomacy and the gnomes make her the candy.

However, after almost a decade since the game came out, submissions are very scarce nowadays, so I decided to finally make the jump to NWN2.\n\nNevertheless, I found several things to be... disturbing during my first few minutes of playing, and chose to share them here, so as to get confirmation/rejection of very specific issues:\n\n1. I went around the configuration menus once and again to try and get smooth camera turning via mouse or keyboard, but no matter what I changed, the camera moved in half-frozen, long and wide turns, as if there were pre-determined widths of turn. Is this correct, and camera turning isn't nearly as smooth as in NWN, or have I just missed a certain configuration to make it work seamlessly?\n\n2. While in NWN both Bioware and the community have worked to make a sharp and \"focused\" graphical experience, it seems to me NWN2 is \"Glary\" and relies on shader and lighting resources, rather than textures. Again, am I right, or is there a configuration option to make NWN2 less \"shinny and blurry\"?\n\n3. Though there is a wide array of NWN2 mods already uploaded to the vault, the files seem to be significantly fewer than those for NWN. One may consider the fact the previous game is older, and therefore there's been much more time to work on it, but it seems to me the proportional amount of NWN2 files is still very low. The straight question would be: Is NWN2 not as \"Modifiable\" or easy to personalize as NWN was?\n\n4. My final question is probably the easiest to answer. There are some modifications I find \"indispensable\" to play NWN (chalk it up to the fact the game spoiled me with its vast potential for über personalization),and they are the LETO character editor, and the Character Customize Override. Any gamer armed with both of them could easily modify ANYTHING regarding their own character, and although I know there is a LETO for NWN2, I have not found something similar to the Character Customize Override, which is, in plain terms, an internal crafting dialog to let the gamer modify tails, wings, colors in anything dyed, body parts, shields, armors, weapons,visual effects, etc. Did I miss it, or is there actually no CCO parallel for NWN2?\n\nAnyway, thanks in advance for any info you may share on the previous particulars. I apologize if such things have already been asked, but while searching for specific answers, I found none.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"456":{"Name":"Creature model - bigby hand","Author":"Melshin","Submitted":20100706,"Updated":20100706,"Category":"Other","Type":"Monsters","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Original \"Bigby Hand\" line of spells is overpowered.

The merchant Sasani has set up a company based in Crossroad Keep and amid curious attacks on her caravans by yuanti assassins and others, you sense an opportunity to make some coin. Eluding you though is the source of an inexplicable tune that has plagued your dreams, (and they've been unusual dreams too for that matter), for months. A song whose lyrics are calling you to Neverwinter, and you have so far failed to resist. \n\nStarting as a 10th level adventurer, you will encounter others drawn by the song, and a mysterious kobald sorceress who will come against you at ever turn and whose ever increasing power is as inexplicable as her motives. \n\nBased on your class, alignment and even your deity (to a limited extent), you will find many different ways to make money and sustain your lifestyle whatever that may be. Raid Sasani's caravans, protect them for a reward, run a con, rob a bank, work for your church, and many, many others. \n\nTravel through time to the future, where the goddess of magic has been slain plunging the world into chaos, and to the past, specifically the time of troubles when the gods themselves were mortals, and magic, particularly divine magic functioned unexpectedly and often not at all. \n\nSeize the day: save the weave, become a god, screw things up entirely...the choice is yours. Six different endings are possible, one as early as chapter one. The rest are divided up between the future and the past. \n\nIf anyone is interested in helping make this dream which is nothing more than an idea at this stage, a reality please let me know at [url]http://www.djbartle2@gmail.com.[/url] As an idea man, I fear this will remain only in my dreams without talented modellers, scripters and writers (particularly where side-quests are concerned), and someone better than I with the nwn2 toolset which is probably everyone. \n \n\nCast of characters: (at least as far as chapter 1).\n\nDeekin � The 'great' bard has become separated into a mindless body, capable of performing only necessary functions with the help of a gnomish device, and his spirit. Deekin has seen the future and it is grim. Knowing that his fate is linked with the future of the weave, (if it fails he remains forever a non-corporeal entity), he has sent out a call to certain susceptible individuals upon whose shoulders he has placed the future. \n\nShade Grey � A former shadow thief of amn who lost his life when he stepped through a mirror into the plane of shadow. Unlike other shadows who detest life, Shade who had a carefree attitude in life has remained so in death. He is available as a companion for members of the thieves guild. \n\nDorna � A dwarven rouge/cleric originally from Hilltop, Dorna is available to characters following the good or neutral path. She clashes with Kelgar, and is a staunch proponent of finders-keepers, and while quick to offer her divine powers for good is far from charitable. \n\nEzra � Formerly a member of a shadow dancer troupe which vanished several years ago under suspicious circumstances. Ezra is a human rouge/assassin specialising in ranged combat and is available to characters following the evil path. \n\nAron �Sure-foot� Toeproud � Sure-foot was a pirate, at least according to ale house gossip, who got his arse handed to him in a duel with a 'descendant of Mazzy Fentan.' Swearing off his life of crime to one of upholding the law and doing well by his fellows, Aron Toeproud has become the scourge of the Neverwinter Docks District, and is a significant thorn in the side of would be pirates and the local thieves guild. \n\nDeedee Tinkerwell � A gnome maker of potions and various other goodies, Deedee is a secretive shopkeeper and inventor whose latest invention has kept the body of the kobold bard Deekin breathing for months without his spirit to sustain it. For Deedee time is the only frontier left to crack, and with everything to lose and nothing to gain Deedee has made Deekin's mad quest to save the weave her driving ambition. \n\nTiny � A half-orc rouge who attempted to lift one of Deedee's inventions, and became mesmerised by it, and thus by her. Tiny now lingers ever at her side when he isn't off on an errand for her, or procuring special items for sale at their shop. \n\nSimon � Simon the Fantabulous is a washed up has been of a wizard who while still bristling with power is a bumbling, befuddled and forgetful waif on death's doorstep. He has been Deedee's friend for several years for two reasons, her cough mixture, mundane though it is, is the only one to have ever worked on his affliction, and her insatiable curiosity for that which cannot yet be explained scientifically � magic. Simon sells magical goods at the trio's store. \n\nZiff the Artificer � A gnome. Usually those two words are enough of a description to stop right there, but in this case perhaps not. Ziff, like many gnomes, is an inventor. A crafter of weapons, potions, armors and traps, and an illusionist to boot. And while not one to boast, he has been known from time to time to have claimed a scholarship with the acclaimed scholars of Candle Keep. What sets Ziff apart from some most other wizards however is his masterful knack for finding, disarming and placing traps.\n\nSaris � A Drow female warrior, Saris is a Blackguard, operating on behalf of Lloth in much the same way as a paladin of Tyr for his god. Saris is a cruel, cunning and a stalwart champion of evil, almost never defeated. However, she has remained on the surface world after her small war-band was routed in a pitched battle with a wandering Paladin. She will join anyone willing to help put the 'dog' down. \n\nGargamal � This devil was bound in the wizards tower in Neverwinter � and by a twist of fate he may become bound to the PC. Only available to non-good PC's who have been trained at the Academy of Magic, Gargamal is one of the most powerful fighters around. \n\nBrock Fentan � The paladin who slew Saris' evil band. Brock will join anyone willing help put a stop to her campaign of terror, which has been her primary method for drawing him out. Supposedly a descendant of Mazzy, the paladin of Avereen isn't even a halfling, or even a quarter halfling, but he has a special affinity for the small folk nonetheless and will fiercely protect them. \n\nGnawbone � An orc from distant lands, Gnawbone should have been the shaman of his tribe but following his heart he became a patron of nature. Even among the other races of the sword coast he is considered a druid of no small renown and more bizarrely still, calm of temperament. \n\nNada Deathless � Where most halflings are happy go lucky wanderers and tend towards acts of light hearted mischief, Nada is neither happy nor lucky. Her misfortune began at childhood with the deaths of both parents. Depression set in some time after that. Determined to make her own luck and to live long enough to enjoy it, Nada embraced the dark arts and is a skilled and fearsome necromancer.\n\nZarin � A former Zhentarim agent, and the proverbial wild goose that began the chase (more on the chase later). Zarin has been haunted by the nightmares longer than most of the current Scalesingers and he has followed those dreams westward to the sword coast. On his arrival he found he was not alone when a wealthy 'business' man who offered him a place to stay confided in him that he too dreamed he was a Kobold bard in a hostile world. After that the rest was history. \n\nZakere (Zack) � A harper agent who was reportedly murdered in Cornybury three months before the fiasco began. Why he was there, was a complete mystery, but since many harper agents operate almost completely independently few questions were asked. When Zack and Zarin eventually met up in Blacklake it was Zack who revealed he knew exactly where Deekins body could be found � at his sisters house, in Cornybury, suported by one of Deedee Tinkerwell's machines. \n\nMartin Keller � A wealthy 'business' man who sheltered Zarin and later his 'crew' before the Harper's arrived and things got too hot. He has remained in contact with them however. He too is haunted by visions of a twisted future of pain and misery and he continues plunge large amounts of gold and steel into Scalesingers coffers. \n\nThe Warlock � Never revealing his name for fear it will give others power over him, this paranoid and seemingly delusional elf warlock is, at best clinically insane and at worst utterly psychotic. Names he responds to in conversation are; 'hey you', 'elf', 'warlock' and 'nobody' (although he quivers with rage when called that one). Although he is an active member of the Scalesingers, few can fathom his motives as he radiates a palpable aura of pure evil.\n\nMiles � A Tiefling, combat oriented cleric: Miles is a follower of Gargaras and follows the clerical domains of war and destruction. \n\nCedrick � An Ex-Paladin who discovered his innate magical abilities after his fall from grace. He now seeks to redeem himself by becoming an eldritch knight and eventually a divine champion of the goddess of magic. \n\nSami -- Coming from a wealthy background originally, Samantha found her release from the boring ho hum of noble life by way of the rogue. Able to bluff, talk, intimidate, lock-pick, steal and back-stab her way out of anything she is a real up-and-comer in the underworld. \n\nMr Saxon � A wealthy merchant who took up residence in Blacklake, he has been providing a substantial financial boost to the organization after the Warlock called his debts.\n\nSasani � A very successful business woman who has made the sword coast her home. In a few months her company has outgrown all its competition. As part of a deal made with Kelgar and ratified later by Lord Nasher, Sasani's company has spent hundreds and thousands of coins on improving Neverwinter's economy and upgrading the arms and armour of local malitias. Unfortunately, her company has been plagued by savage attacks by monstrous humanoids and more recently by yuanti assassins who have killed several members of her company so far. \n\nMistress � A curious kobold whom you accidentally (or purposefully) 'saved' during an incident in a tavern. Angered by your interference in her affair's Mistress soon makes your life a misery. Mistress grows in power significantly after each encounter.\n","Rating":9.25,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"460":{"Name":"Wolf Heads","Author":"Oeil-de-Loup","Submitted":20100824,"Updated":20100825,"Category":"Other","Type":"Models","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"I recently read an awesome comic book in which there were wolfmen, and found the face (only the face) of the werewolf in NWN2 perfect for that purpose.\nWere it not of the face or the tail, their body is completely human.

Including additional voicesets, particularly nicer sounding ones and some more less gruff female ones, and some that are more appropriate for charismatic good characters of either gender. Also including extra and/or replacement heads, given how many completely ugly heads there are, and expanded color options, but still within racial limits, rather than going the full united colors mode. A bunch more hairstles and such might be nice too.\n\nThe primary purpose wouldn't be the graphics and sound stuff mentioned above though, that should be secondary to the main purpose, just, if they manage to get it compatible, it should be part of the main download and install.\n\nThe main purpose is a re-working of the entire campaign. Fixing plot holes, adding extra options, dealing with AI issues, adding more romance plots, adding more character development to the companions, adding stuff to the keep, adding more items and crafting options, and more support for races and classes from the expansions. Increasing the possibilities of many dialogues based on PC character's race and class, and adding a bunch of potential plot branches.\n\nIn particular, I'd like to see these potential plot branches:\n\n1. Amie survives: If you can get Amie to survive somehow, perhaps by convincing her not to jump in, or having her cast endure elements or something beforehand, make it possible for her to either become a full fledged compainion with behavior and dialogue throughout the OC, or perhaps just an optional Sergent for your keep like Bevil, or maybe becoming an optional mage/shopkeep for a magic tower in your keep.\n\n2. Save Shandra's farm, some kind of way to stop the Lizardfolk from burning down her farm, perhaps a survival check while you are approaching which will reveal the Lizardfolk tracks, or a spot/listen check during the dialogue to catch them early and be able to confront/chase-off/capture and interrogate them or something. Saving Shandra's farm would later make it easier to talk with her and convince her to escape with you later, and have the conversation about stuff before she gets kidnapped.\n\n3. Shandra's kidnapping: there should be a way to stop this, perhaps an wisdom check to allow you an option to set guards, with spot/listen checks or spellcraft checks to prevent their entry into Shandra's room and save her. You'd still chase after their main base to find out why they've been harassing you after Bishop discovers where they came from.\n\n4. Shandra survives: Some way to save Shandra and have her survive, possibly influence checks when telepathically communicating with her, combined with certain dialogue options, or maybe having certain spells or items on reserve when you reach her to be able to heal her if you are 'fast' enough getting there in some way. Maybe even preventing her from freeing the demons and devils in such a way that it allows you to properly explain the situation to Jerro, and allow him to keep his Haven, in which case he doesn't join your party yet, but stops working against you and will reinforce you with summoned demons and devils during the attack on your keep, and only join your party as you start to re-forge the sword, or at some point coming to the keep and telling you that his Haven was attacked and destroyed by the King of Shadow's forces, and he is now forced to work with you.\n\n5. Use truename scrolls yourself: this should be an option if you have enough ranks in spellcraft and/or lore and are of an appropriate spellcasting class such as cleric, wizard, warlock, or bard, although probably not druids or sorcerers.\n\n6. Give up shards to Zeirre: This would involve some pretty tough skill checks, including diplomacy, and likely involve your character being evil, or at least cause you to become more evil and cause you to lose influence with characters like Elanee, Shandra, and Khelgar. But you can completely give up the Shards and convince Zeerie that you never intended to get involved in this mess in the first place, and your fusion with the shard in your chest was accidental. You would not be able to make or use the Silver Sword, at least that one, but might be able to gain a githyanki ally for the final battle against the King of Shadows who wields a Silver Sword, or have to find another way to defeat the King of Shadows.\n\nAlso this would have to likely have completely new voice-work for all the characters given the extra dialogue options added, and doing this would open up the chance for some of the characters to be re-worked. As it is, there is some issues of character alignments being inaccurate, and why some characters would be accepted into the party at all. In particular, Qara often behaves more like chaotic evil than chaotic neutral, it's hard to imagine a good PC tolerating Bishop's presence and behavior, especially if they are a ranger themselves and could theoretically track the Githyanki without him, and other issues.\n\nPersonally, I'd kinda like to see a nicer variation on Qara, still cleverly insulting and fiercely independent, but less kill everything with fire, trying to make her more properly Chaotic Neutral.\n\nI'd also like to see adjustments to much of the dialogue options and plot-options that are supposedly 'chaotic' seem less evil, irresponsible, or chaotic-stupid. Chaotic is not irresponsible, chaotic isn't defying the law for the sake of defying the law, chaotic is not ignoring responsibilities. Chaotic is placing personal freedoms and independence above the order of society, chaotic is not being beholden to the nominal rulers of the land just because they are in charge, chaotic is questioning authority with impunity, chaotic is not holding yourself to a hard and strict set of rules, but making things up as you go along and depending on the situation.\n\nOther alignments aren't so accurately represented either, although not as badly as chaotic. They actually did 'good' pretty well, but a lot of the evil often seems over the top, or even outright bloodthirsty, with little options for a subtle charismatic or sneaky evil character, or a selfish neutral evil character who only outwardly follows the rules and sucks up to authority (besides the various bribe accepting plays in the whole joining the City Watch thing). Why can't the player be like Torio or something, manipulative, clever, snide, sarcastic, but with terrible goals and secret actions and difficult to catch in the act.\n\nOr some lawful evil options, where you'd stick with the City Watch but be such a stickler for the law and use the easiest loopholes and stuff to sadistically punish any law-breakers far beyond their crimes, and become a terrible tyrant with strict laws and heavy taxes in the keep.\n\nI'd also like to see options and possibility to catch Bishop when he tries to desert, and perhaps execute him if captured or just kill him in a fight or something, and keep him from ever reaching the King of Shadows, either by catching him and talking him out of it with influence checks and diplomacy and such, or just killing him or holding him prisoner.\n\nSome romance options I'd like to see might be:\n1. Qara romances for male (and possibly female) PCs of compatible races and of the Bard, Sorcerer, or Warlock classes.\n2. Grobnar romance for female gnome (and maybe halfing) characters with high influence with Grobnar who believe in the Wendersnaven.\n3. Kelgar romance for female dwarven characters.\n4. Sand romances for elven and half-elven female lawful non-evil characters with high influence with Sand who did the court case fully (rather than just letting Sand do it automatically) and did so well and successfully, possibly with some class restrictions.\n5. Neeshka romance options for male (and possibly female) PCs with good influence with her if she has become the best thief in Neverwinter and you or her have Leldon's Lucky Coin.\n6. Possible female PC Elanee romance that is slightly different from the male version, maybe with an option to keep the romance secret from the other companions.\n\n(Sorry if it seems sexist that I only brought up female homosexual options, I'm a straight guy here, and I've only played through the OC as a female character so far, and none of the male characters seem to give hints of being gay or bisexual, while some of the female characters, particularly Neeshka, seemed to occasionally hint at feelings towards the female PC... I would not be opposed to someone making a male homosexual romance option, but I'd want it to be believable and fit the character, which might require removal or modification of some existing dialogue to change their sexuality and make it noticeably homosexual or perhaps bisexual or vague)\n\nI'd want all romance options to make sense and have more depth and character development. My experience running the game with a female PC I went ahead and allowed the Casavir romance on the rooftop, but I never really felt like there was any actual development up to that, and the whole thing seemed to be over in a moment, and never really brought up again except allusion by Bishop in a rather jealous-like manner.\n\nAll the OC companions need more character development in general, which would require some serious writing skills. Khelgar is okay, he's actually got a lot going on, and Neeshka seems to have plenty of past, but little actual development and/or change through the course of the campaign, just learning to trust the PC if you develop your influence with her, and her resistance in the endgame to stick with you if you have the influence.\n\nElanee doesn't have much details to her past, you kinda wonder how she became a druid and stuff, what her childhood was like, things about her animal companion, how her circle was different from other Druid circles, and so many other possible avenues of character background. She also has little development, mostly just influence matters with your PC. She might not have great flaws like Khelgar to get over, but that doesn't mean she can't have character development, even just becoming a stronger druid more in tune with nature could be turned into character development if done right (perhaps along with options to help you purify druids and animals and the land from shadow-influence if you do some extra side-plot that could be added in just for her).\n\nZhajive is downright annoying, but what makes it worse, is she is terribly boring and generic. She is Ms. Sterotypical Githyanki cleric build. There is nothing that makes her unique other than her race, to the point she is more like a race than an individual. Changing her speech patterns to make her less annoying I think would be a cop-out, so probably a bad idea, instead, she needs a history, and maybe a hint of character development (not much time for it given how late you get her though). What was her childhood or at least recent past like, what was she doing when she found out about the situation, who taught her, who were her parents, what was it like living in limbo or adventuring on the astral plane fighting against Githyanki plots, how hard was it for her to live as a captive to Black Garius?\n\nGrobnar is like a living joke. Even his Wendersnaven quest makes him less appealing to most players. He makes Kender bearable by comparison. But that doesn't mean he doesn't have room to grow. Where did he come from? Who was his family? What stories does he have from what adventures he has before meeting you? What is his relationship with Construct like (other than insane suicidal devotion to the umm... dear thing?)? How did he get training as a bard, how did he learn instruments and songs? From what libraries did he learn lore from before you met? An extra grobnar side-quest or two would also be nice.\n\nQara I'd like to see developed through developing the Academy. I'd like to meet her family (or at least hear about it) and the teachers and students there. See them argue with Qara and/or Sand or perhaps sometimes get along with Sand. I'd like to have mini-quests for your character if you are a wizard, and possibly some other classes related to magic, possibly even an option to join the academy after you have full access to Blacklake, and gain some additional resources and options from that for Wizard characters. I'd also like options to be able to mellow out and change Qara through difficult diplomacy and other checks throughout the game, possibly resulting in her becoming chaotic good alignment if the PC is good and succeeds at all this and some special Qara quest, and if you succeed at this, you can even keep both Qara and Sand on your side against Garius in the final fight against him.\n\n\nAlso, I'd like to see some class specific bonus quests. I'd like to see tracking related stuff for rangers, or specific quests against some common favored enemies if you have those enemies.\n\nI'd like to see special wizard options when encountering magic stuff, including spellcraft checks and stuff like in the Wizard's Apprentice module, and being able to join mage guilds, and set up wizarding type wards around your keep, inscribed into the stones with a special quest of sorts (to gather the materials) and checks (to put in the wards).\n\nI'd like to see special cleric (and paladin) quests for common deity options, or at least those where there is a temple to your deity in the game. I'd like to see options to place divine magic wards about your keep for good clerics which help weaken and repel the undead during the keep assault as if it is sanctified grounds via a special quest (to gather materials) and checks (to perform the necessary ceremonies and rituals to purify the lands, possibly needing to remove the summoning circle from the basement).\n\nI'd like to see fighting class character quests where the PC seeks or is saught for training revolving around various NPCs, or perhaps is noted for history with your town milita and their developing martial skill, and test-battles to prove their martial skills in various venues.\n\nI'd like to see more special monk training, quests, and such, possibly some extra/modified Kelgar talk for monks, particularly monks of Tyr.\n\nI'd like to see more pickpocket stuff for rogues, and more of a purpose and options for the whole setting traps thing. I mean really, they toss out those traps like candy, but it seems all you can do with them is sell them. I'd kinda like to see some of the quests where you are guarding a place or person and stuff be more set up to allow you to set traps, perhaps traps at Shandra's room she is warned about (to keep her from hurting herself) in the Sunken Flagon could stop the Githyanki from kidnapping her.\n\nI'd like to see more options for bards to entertain on the streets of Neverwinter and other locations for money or other quest goals, like amusing certain characters who are otherwise troublesome (perhaps entertaining a certain Red Dragon to help escape, or other such options).\n\nExtra racial options might be nice too, possibly even for elven and half-elven characters actually being Dhaegun's real blood daughter, or for dwarven characters being of the Ironfist clan from some of them who fought in the battle of West Harbor or something. Being recognize as having Illfarne bloodlines for half-elven, elven, or dwarven characters including extra plot options and an extra free 'feat'. Extra interactions and dialogue with Neeshka for tiefling characters, possibly even being an actual cousin to her. Some of these options might have to be covered by new background options at the start of the game.\n\nI'd also like to see more effects of some of the background options later in the game, rather than just in West Harbor in the early game.\n\nThis project would be a large undertaking, likely needing a large team, and probably some people able to do a lot of voice acting (which I might be able to do for some male voices), and some very skilled scripters and writers. Even some animators for some of the extra dialogue paths and such, and some CG people if it includes graphical improvements.\n\nAgain, the purpose is to make a better version/expansion to/of the OC, perhaps like Obsidian might have made if they had another year to add extra finish to the game. Something with more options, better character development, extra finish, smoother story, and more attention to detail (possibly removing some bugs still existing in the OC even after the latest patches along the way). Something that would perhaps only add an extra hour or two to an individual play-through, but which would add a ton more re-playability for someone who wants to mess around with different classes, races, alignments, skills and such.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"469":{"Name":"Misery Stone Werewolf Model","Author":"Sansagraw","Submitted":20110216,"Updated":20110216,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"New Werewolf Model","Type":"Request to be created","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"As to anyone that knows.

'patch' if source is released","Type":"Request to be created","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"If you haven't heard, there is a chance the source code to NWN2 might be released in some fashion.\n\nLink\n\nIf this happens, there might be unprecedented new ability to mod the game.\n\nOne of the things that has long bugged me about NWN2 is some aspects of the graphics engine and character creation and clothing and stuff.\n\nEven with mods like Sexy OC Reloaded, there are numerous wonky aspects of how characters wear clothes, customize outfits, look nude (if nude is an option), and a lot of the heads and hairs that come with the game are fail or rather vanilla, or bodies a bit wonky, not to mention a lot of clothing and equipment tends to clip in all sorts of weird ways.\n\nFor example, even with Sexy OC Reloaded, nude characters tend to have faint 'boot' shapes noticeable on their lower legs, and odd seams on their backs. All sorts of mods for faces and hair can cause odd clipping issues, especially when using alternate races that the faces or hair weren't built for. Many armors tend to have pieces that penetrate each other or stick through cloaks. Sometimes a character's arms and/or weapons will stick through cloaks or parts of their body. Many hairs interact weirdly or poorly with hats and helms. Weird body skin vs. head skin tone conflicts due to the base game having no skin below the heads and using clothes only, leading to stuff like the female warlock costume changes with the expansions.\n\nI propose, if the people who get their hands on the source are up to it, to create 2 lines of patches, one with the standard graphics engine (with bugs fixed if any), and one with a seriously upgraded game with many aspects of the engine improved in ways that are either already done with mods, or can't currently be done with mods. In particular, for this 2nd line, perhaps called NWN2 CC (Community Cut) would have updated graphics and graphics engine.\n\nDesired/potential features might include:\n\n1. Nude/Underwear full base models. No longer will the head and body have weird separate skin issues, weird clipping and seams between body parts on nude models. The base version would likely utilize customizable underwear and tatoos in character creation much like the original Neverwinter Nights 1. This would be visible underneath partial outfits that don't cover the whole body.\n\n2. Meshed physics hair. Hair would no longer be as much of solid objects. Instead it would be a mesh that sort of 'grows' off the scalp and prefers certain shapes and flows certain ways, but is often flattend down by hats, and won't clip with the character's back or cloak or hats, but instead avoid or flow across them. Individual hair strands aren't needed, particularly since it would probably increase the engine's demands on base computing ability, just slightly more complex 'flexible' hair objects, parts of which would attach to a scalp mesh (so it could fit differently shaped heads easily) and based on certain 'squash/touch' type mechanics built into the hair meshes would avoid clipping through other objects, particularly any hats or cloaks.\n\n3. Clothing/gear 'layers'. Rather than solid 'outfit' objects, some things of this sort could come in 'layers' or assembled pieces. For instance you could have a traveler's outfit, with a chain-shirt over it, and switch out it's belt, boots, and gloves for the currently worn ones. Each outfit that can be mix and matched with other items like that would be made up of individual pieces or groups which attach to the outer mesh of the character's body, and some would have an outer-mesh on top of them for wearing a layer over them, or lacing aspects for things like belts going through belt-loops, and would have flexibility built in designed to prevent the clothes from clipping each-other or the character or most objects, particularly carried or worn objects.\n\n4. Complete (or mostly so) new heads/bodies set, possibly partly assembled from already made custom content. This would use graphics quality standards closer to the newer and nicer custom content heads and hair, or those added in some of the expansions, particularly the gensai. Many of the heads and hair that come with the game are just crappy, the half-elf and elf heads in particular are quite horrid.\n\n5. Adjusted character creation setup for new graphics tricks. Possibilities of head 'adjustments' similar to the kind of stuff you can do in Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, or Oblivion. Wider ranges of hair, skin, and eye colors based on racial norms. Multiple body 'builds' such as lanky, athletic, muscle-bound, thick (I doubt the engine could quite handle 'fat'), and perhaps for females a choice between two or three breast-size options. Potential for applying special traits or modifications both at character creation or later, such as a PRC that might give you scaly red skin, or glowing eyes, give you wings or a tail, or various other changes, such as seen in the Geomancer PRC in cannon D&D, or getting new hair cuts or hair color changes by, for instance, going to the barber, or having some magical thing happen to you that causes your hair to turn white, or going to a magical beautician and being able to get your hairstyle, hair colors, eye color and other aspects changed, or temporary changes from certain spells, such as if psychic warriors were added being able to transform your hands into claws, or a psion using synthensate being able to make his eyes disappear (staying closed with eyelashes going away?). Or being able to get and remove tattoos. Some potential to go back to aspects of character creation to a limited degree, for instance when using temporary magical disguises, or upon being exposed to a belt of gender change, allowing you to pick your female head and hairstyle (but not change race or colors).\n\n6. Customizable familiars/animal companions: Familiars and animal companions could have tintable parts of their coats and eyes, and some would have multiple coat patterns to choose from, such as various patterns for the cat, including calico and tiger-stripped and solid and 'boots' modes, and a solid color bunny, and then being able to select different fur colors. Possibly some different builds for some of them, or special features or add ons, such as being able to have a collar, or a torn ear, or a cat with a missing tail.\n\n7. Special facial hair options for both male and female: Not neccesarily talking about dwarven females with beards or something silly like that, I'm more talking about for females different styles of eyelashes, and for both genders, different styles of eyebrows, including potentially 'awesome bushy eyebrows' or 'long Warcraft III elf eyebrows' or 'earth gensai leaf eyebrows' or something along those lines as potential options, or simply 'no eyebrows' as an option. And of course different types of male beards and moustaches and such for the races that can have them (perhaps female versions as well for some races...!? 0.o )\n\n8. Ear/horn swapping: Some, or all, races might share the same faces to some degree, but you swap out things like ears, or adding horns. There might also be some special options if not of ear/horn types, such as different lengths and pointing directions of elf-ears, some half-elf ear variations between elf and human ears, weather a tiefling has pointed ears, and how pointed, and different types of horns or no-horns for tiefling (and probably choosing if you want a tail for your tiefling and from different tail options). Actually, for the horns I'd probably include that as part of hairstyles for the tieflings, to make it still customizable, but not have weird clipping issues with the hair, they'd probably have to be built together, also allowing more different horn placements.\n\n9. Wearable options: Some clothing items, such as cloaks, might be able to be worn in several ways, such as choosing to have the hood of a cloak up or down, or reversible cloaks that are different colors on each side, or bracelets you can choose which wrist (or perhaps ankle) to wear them on, or rings you can choose which finger to wear them on, or to instead wear them as earrings or something. Basically, allowing some clothing to have several options for how they are worn, for the same item.\n\n10. Sexy OC Reloaded and some other stuff already has this to varying degrees, but some spells spells affecting skin only rather than the whole body, like ironskin and barkskin and stoneskin and such. Other spells would affect the whole body. Another thing to look at might be 'aura effects' that sort of flame off the body and gear if things make them visible as special spellcasting effects or effects visible when certain spells are cast.\n\n11. More potential environmental, weather, and spell effects\n\n12. Potential to apply certain bonus effects to all spells of a certain character, or to only spells a character is using under certain conditions, such as spells of focused or specialized schools getting an extra glowing effect, or celestial spell glow effects being changed to different color schemes, or a metamagic feat applying special effects to spells cast with it (if this isn't already possible in the engine).\n\n13. Facial expressions and emotes, being able to set your character's default expressions, such as an 'angry' face, or a 'calm' face and such from several options.\n\n14. Customizable make up, both at char-creation and in-game, such as if using a 'makeup' item or a 'washcloth' item or a 'disguise' type spell or something.\n\n15. Ability to get 'clean, dirty, sweaty, and/or bloodied' for instance characters and objects would have clean, dirty, and bloody versions, and some objects might have broken/damaged versions. Perhaps a character under half their max HP would have some wounds with blood on them, a character who was hit by certain spells or environmental effects or traps might become dirty, (or simply over time if they don't bathe), and some items, environmental interactions, and spells could allow you to clean yourself. Weapons might be able to get chips and dents if sundered but not yet destroyed, or get dirty or covered with the blood of enemies, and be able to be cleaned and/or repaired. There might also be broken versions of sundered items that could perhaps be salvaged for raw materials or repaired, but unlike simply damaged objects can't be used.\n\n16. Various distinctive/weird traits, such as heterochemia, a mole placed somewhere on the face, scars on the face or body in different places, some placeable, shaved off eyebrow, partly missing ear, missing fingers, missing teeth, slight fangs, dirty/crooked teeth, oversized buck teeth, having a dimple only on one side when smiling, innie or outie belly button, or various types of piercings.\n\n17. More base races and the graphics for them, such as Warforged, Changelings, Kalashtar, Shifters, Thri-Kreen, Elan (although those might just use human models), Maenads, Half-Giants, Goliaths, Githyanki, Githzerai, Dragonborn, Dromites, Xeph, Hengaiyokai, Nezumi, Korobokuru, Spirit Folk, Vanara, Raptorans, Catfolk, Killoren, or Hobgoblins.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"481":{"Name":"Knight - PHBII","Author":"BootStrapTommy","Submitted":20111009,"Updated":20111010,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Knight - PHBII","Type":"Additions","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Make the Knight base class from the Player's Handbook II.
