Save.\n\n*****************************************************************\n2.Description\n*****************************************************************\n\nThese are packs of custom portraits for use in NWN 2.\n\nThere are 132 portraits in total, in pack 1 & 32 in Pack 2 and cover a very wide range of characters. :)\n\nThe collage image availible for viewing to the right shows only a very small sample of a few randomly selected portraits.\n\nThe portraits are made from screenshots I took while playing games over the years and include screenshots from Oblivion & Lord of the Rings Online. There are also a few extra portraits included that are of famous paintings or actors.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n*****************************************************************\n3. To make portraits of your own for NWN 2\n*****************************************************************\n\n1. Create the portrait using whatever image editing application. Dimensions must be 128x128, bitdepth 24 bits, save as TGA (targa) using no compression. I used Paint.NET.\n\n2. Save the image in this path: \"My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\ui\\custom\\images\\icons\\\" (without quotes).\nEveryone should have the path \"My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\ui\\custom\\\" already, just add the missing folders. Do not include spaces in the filename.\n\n3. Get a GFF editor from the vault: Link\n\n4. Run the GFF editor, File -> Open. Navigate to a save game folder (if you want to edit an existing game). Save games are stored in \"My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Saves\\\". Open the file \"playerlist.ifo\".\n\n4a.

Link\nSelect a different entry afterwards so GFFeditor will accept the newly added string.\n\n7. Save.\n\nRemarks:\n- This is not supported officially. If you run into problems, it's your own fault.\n- If you have mods installed that change the file partybar.xml and are not explicitly compatible with 1.07, the game will crash.\n- I used TlkEdit2: Click Here\n- Opening an existing save game where I had set \"CustomPortrait\" before, I noticed that the \"Portrait\" entry had the same value. I suppose it doesn't matter (I never changed the latter manually).\n- Appearently a character bic-file created with 1.07 but not explicitly manually exported has no entry \"CustomPortrait\".\n- I just noticed Gffeditor says \"Data format: 16 characters, no spaces etc.\" I'm not sure if this applies to NWN2, but do adhere to this recommendation.\n\n*****************************************************************\n3.

This pack contains around 658 portraits. That's probably more than you'll ever need. It is a compilation of the various packs already on the vault, as well as some additions and modifications not found here. Most importantly, it holds at least 40 Tiefling portraits for both sexes! Yay!\n\nYou will find companions portraits for the OC and SoZ at the top of the list.

I wanted to try an avoid too many subraces, as what I would consider one thing someone else would consider another.\n\nAlso note that I have removed almost all of the full body portraits found in most packs. It's a personal preference of mine to feature portraits which, amusingly, are actually a portrait.\n\nThis pack should ideally contain no duplicates.
