To this end, the module provides the character with the ability to: \n1. Alter his level and alignment. The character is given the ability to raise and lower his level. The character can also change his alignment at any level and the \"Neverwinter Nine\" and \"Shadowthief of Amn\" epithet feats have been added. Hence, any class combination supported by the game engine can be created. There is also an option to write a character's level progression including feats chosen, skills taken and attributes increased to the log file, so that the character can be recreated on a PW or another server vault scenario.\n2. Equip himself. A forge has been added which can create weapons, armor and gear. The included Item properties have their full range of values. Hence enhancements and armor class bonuses can range from 0 to 20, Attribute boosts can range from 1 to 12, skill boosts from 1 to 50, etc. Equipment can have any number of item properties upon it. All of the standard potions, wands, rods and staves and curios have been included, as well as a full selection of arcane scrolls. The character can rename his equipment and has access to unlimited gold. In addition to exporting the character to a bic file, the module also allows the player to write a text printout of his level progression to the client log file. \n3. Test his battle prowess. The character can test himself, alone or with one to five henchmen, in combat against one to six opponents at a time in any one of multiple arenas. The opponents are divided into monstrous opponents and PC builds. The PC builds have custom AI scripts, which simulate the behavior of a human player better than the default AI and should give the player an inclination of how his character would perform in a player vs. player environment. The enemies can have their gear customized; i.e. changing the enhancement level of weapons, armor, etc. Hence, characters can be tested against the type of opponents they would face in low magic and high magic settings. The AI can also be adjusted so that it will or will not use knockdown and will or will not buff itself before combat. In addition to the default PC builds within the module, a database has been added that allows the player to fight against up to 10 of his own builds. The arenas are varied, ranging from a deserted coliseum, to a volcano with damaging environmental effects, to a constricted dungeon with randomly opening and closing gates. They are designed to take into account the effects that environment can have on the combat capabilities of a character.\n\nCredits:\nSnow VFX in the Icy Cliff arena courtesy of Eguintir Eligard.\n\n***** Version 3.3 Final is now available *****\n\nThis version has been updated to patch 1.23.

This folder has not chaged since version 3.1, so you don't need to replace it if you already have it.\n\nThen start the game and select \"New Game\" followed by \"New Campaign,\" the campaign should appear in list of available campaigns. \n\nIn order to write your character's level progression to the log file you will need to enable logging within NWN2. To do this, you will need to set Scripts Print To Log=1 under server options in your nwnplayer.ini and nwn2player.ini file (it should be the second to last line in the file).

There are no shops so there is no point in holding on to obsolete items.\n\nArmor doesnt give you AC, it gives you additional HP - The weakest armor you can get gives you +10 Hp (Leather Armor), Its the same as it was in FFT. As for AC - you get that through Shields and weapons, lighter weapons such as Mythril ones give you up to +3 ac, also weapons do not come with increased attack, only increased damage - to get better attack you get more levels.\n\nSo basicially its not about hits and misses anymore, its about how much damage you can do in those hits, and everyone has much more HP because of the way armor works. Your Starting AC is 5, which isnt BAD considering level 2 enemy squires have an attack bonus of +2, which gives you a 2/20 chance to evade the attack at level 1. Now of course your Dex modifier still gives you additional AC, and Armor does NOT restrict your Dex or Skills at all, better armor is ALWAYS better. Instead I'm going to introduce class restricions whenever I get around to making the non-warrior items. Ive already made all of the daggers, armors, capes, swords, boots, gloves, axes and flails that were in FFT.\n\nThis version only contains stage 1. - Tell me what you think so far.\n\nThis module is a hack-and-slash, story-driven module.\n\nStory:\nWhile patroling the countryside of Igros with your loyal soldiers, a Knight, an Archer and a Squire - You heard rumors of Nanteen activity in the east.

Oh! In addition, I beg your pardon for the horrible smell. I'm sweating pretty much everywhere, because of my adventurous and dangerous escape. The laboratory is the place, where I won't return ever again and the reason why I'm talking to you: As you heard I was having a hard time, so please, please hide me on your hard disk from my hostage-taker if there's anything like a heart in your brea...uh-oh...\nHAHAHA!

It will level your characters and give them an appropriate amount of gold for their new level. It will also permit you to purchase a limited assortment of items so that you can have a basic equipment foundation to take with you into new modules. The emphasis is on creating balanced, not overpowered characters that adhere to the classic D&D equipment magic standards endorsed by the Forgotten Realms Weave (FRW) group. It can also serve as a waystation for characters between modules, allowing you to sell off loot, empty your inventory of unwanted items, and buy new gear/potions.\n\nFinally, it serves as a showcase for FRW modules, allowing users to meet NPC's from these modules, learn about the module offerings available, and purchase some of the custom items from these modules.\n\n---Features:\n\n* Level up your character & receive an appropriate amount of gold for this new level.\n* Equip your character with a basic foundation of gear that is appropriate for your level. For low-level characters, these include silver & cold iron masterwork items.\n* Meet with NPC's from FRW modules and learn about those modules.\n* Access the Bartender's Store, which contains (at a premium price) custom items from FRW modules.\n* Sell off loot from previous modules, ditch unwanted items, and re-equip your character between adventures.\n* Remove no-drop items from your inventory.\n* Do a limited amount of crafting (no magic station).\n* Adjust your alignment.\n\nNew in this release: \n\nSupport for the FRW Persistent Companion System (requires hak file).\n\nLeveling up to Level 30 to support MotB and future Epic Level modules.\n\nThis module has been successfully used to create balanced characters for play in the following modules:\n* Lighthouse, The\n* Mystery at Willowbow by Saorsa\n* Subtlety of Thay, The by dirtywick\n* Temple of Torm by Ian Liew\n* Tragedy in Tragidor by Phoenixus (FRW)\n* Witch in the Woods by Lord Niah (FRW)\n\n1/15: I will be posting an updated version of the FRW Character Creator that supports the Epic Levels currently available in Mask of the Betrayer within the week; I will also be adding support for the FRW Persistant Companion System, including an area that you can use to acquire some available Persistant Companions. Thank you for your patience and your continued interest in this project.\n\n1/22: In addition to the new features mentioned above, I have added a way for a level one character to gain a small amount of gold; simply speak with Chatter as you normally would to level up and select the Level 1 option.\n\n2/15: added the FRW Persistant Companion hak do the list of downloads to ease locating that file.","Rating":8.82,"Votes":69,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"97":{"Name":"The Slums","Author":"FriendlyFire","Submitted":20070127,"Updated":20070127,"Category":"No Story (Ex: Resource, Level ups, etc.)","Module Types":"","Scope":"NA","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Nonexistent","Hack & Slash":"Nonexistent","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"1","Patch":"1.00","Description":"This is a city exterior, no inhabitants, lights or scripts, but ready to populate (error free walkmesh, landscaped and textured).

The main plot is set in the Forgotten Realms, where a young adventurer takes on the mission to find and explore lost temples of the dead god Amaunator, who died in the cataclysmic fall of the Netheril empire. On the way he can gain the aid of various (NPC) companions.\n\n\"Mission statement\": The focus is on adventuring and combat, though there should be some \"diplomatic\" solutions as well. I prefer the very low levels (about 1-6 maximum) and would like to emphasize play in this range. Loot and money will be low accordingly. Despite this combat should be balanced to be fun, not frustrating.\nThe campaign should allow the player to take advantage of many skills which are often neglected (for example Search and Listen) and will offer extra options for characters with exceptionally high attributes. Another particular goal I have is to make the environment more dynamic than usual, for example rubble-strewn floors where it is possible to stumble, or knee-high water where running is impossible; these effects should apply to both the player and NPC enemies and allies.\n\nv0.88: \n- major changes\n\nFollowing is a list of gameplay changes and features.\n\n------------------------------\nRESTING SYSTEM\n\nAdventurers need 1 food ration per day. There are 4 grades of food ration: Poor, Average, Good and Superb. These restore respectively up to 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the character's total hit points on resting. This is added after the character loses 5% of current hit points from activating rest (so resting without food leads to a loss of 5% of total hit points). The food rations are automatically deducted from the party's inventory at every rest. Characters with high Survival skill heal more even without food.\n\nSome creatures can be turned into food after slaying them. The food item generated automatically from the creature depends on the character's Survival skill bonus:\nLess than +10: Poor\nover +10: Average\nover +15: Good\nover +20: Superb\n\n------------------------------\nALCHEMICAL ITEMS\n\nThe power of all grenade-like alchemical items has been improved in Ruins of the Sun God:\n\nAcid Flask damage:\nNormal - 2d6 single, 1d6 splash\nImproved - 4d6 single, 2d6 splash\nGreater - 6d6 single, 3d6 splash\nPerfected - 10d6 single, 5d6 splash\n\nAlchemist's Fire damage:\nNormal - 2d6 single, 1d6 splash\nImproved - 4d6 single, 2d6 splash\nGreater - 6d6 single, 3d6 splash\nPerfected - 10d6 single, 5d6 splash\n\nChoking Powder DC:\nNormal - 15\nImproved - 20\nGreater - 25\nPerfected - 30\n\nHoly Water damage:\nNormal - 2d10 single, 1d10 splash\nImproved - 4d10 single, 2d10 splash\nGreater - 6d10 single, 3d10 splash\nPerfected - 10d10 single, 5d10 splash\n\nTanglefoot Bag DC/Dur.:\nNormal - 15/5\nImproved - 20/8\nGreater - 25/12\nPerfected - 30/20\n\nThunderstone DC:\nNormal - 15\nImproved - 20\nGreater - 25\nPerfected - 30\n\n------------------------------\nCRAFTING PRICES\n\nPrices for crafting have been modified. Scolls, potions and wands all now cost SPELLLEVEL x MODIFIER gold to craft, where MODIFIER is:\n\nScroll: 25\nPotion: 50\nWand: 500\n\n------------------------------\nTIME SCALE\n\nOne game hour lasts 5 real-time minutes.\n\n------------------------------\nSPELL RESISTANCE ON ITEMS\n\nThis mod includes a fix for SR on items which is broken in the unfixed game.\n","Rating":6,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"105":{"Name":"Crafting/Dungeoncrawl","Author":"Geistertanz","Submitted":20070218,"Updated":20070219,"Category":"No Story (Ex: Resource, Level ups, etc.)","Module Types":"","Scope":"Small","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Nonexistent","Hack & Slash":"Light","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"10","Gameplay Length":"1","Categories":"Crafting/Shopping","Patch":"1.03","Description":"Two small areas containing crafting workbenches, shops for crafting materials and a small dungeon area.

I've kept a lot of the introductory text and tried to stay fairly close to the original. Some liberties have been taken where my skills in scripting/designing were lacking. I've also fleshed out certain areas, and included some NPCs from when I originally played this module in pen-and-paper- D&D\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This module was due to be completed in a weeks time. However an error crept into some of the final areas which meant that they can no longer be opened in the toolset. However, they are sill playable in the game. It has meant that there are some unfinished/unpolished parts that do not function correctly and I am unable to alter. However, none of this is game breaking.

I�ve taken inspiration, and characters, from several of the tales, combined with an embarrassing knowledge of the Disney versions, and developed an adventure-type game around these. Other fairy tales have worked their way in there too. The adventure is aimed at first level PCs of any race and class, although level adjusted races will find it more difficult. BY the end of the module, races with no ECL will have reached level 4 and your character will be exported\n\nAs per the contest rules, there are 5 areas (1 exterior, 4 interior), and gameplay should take 1-2 hours to complete. The core quest is a race to save a Prince from a wicked spell, but along the way, you�ll meet several other characters who�ll divert you from your goal. There are two core companions, and others will join the party at various points. My aim with the module was to focus on a fun story, with an overarching plot that brought together several different fairy tales, so each could be played in turn. Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, Snow White, and Rumpelstiltskin all have a part to play in the background of the race to rescue Prince Charming and Cinderella�s wedding. The story may seem childish, but being inspired by fairy tales and old Disney filsm, this was inevitable!\n\nThere are several new items and creatures; most created for this module contest, some taken from my previous module Palace of the Silver Princess. Scripting/innovations were kept to a minimum given the time constraints (for me to learn how to do them as much as implement them).\n\nI hope you enjoy and please leave your feedback. Thanks to everyone who fed me back comments during the bug hunting - I really appreciate the help!\n\nVesion 1.1 - 5th June 2007.\nUpdated to include\n- spelling corrections (please note some spelling is deliberate to reflect 'accents' e.g. dwarven)\n- speak triggers added at certain points\n- OnDeath Scripts altered so ending should fire correctly when you meet Melificent (and then the suprise when you defeat her)\n\nPlease let me know of any further bugs you find!\n","Rating":7.29,"Votes":27,"Awards":[]},"131":{"Name":"Hammerfest","Author":"talvisielu","Submitted":20070426,"Updated":20070503,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Small","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Nonexistent","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"10","Gameplay Length":"03","Categories":"Hack'n'slash","Patch":"1.05","Description":"Hammerfest is a hack'n'slash module which will recieve frequent content updates.

It is a medium-magic, high-wonder adventure, as befits a story adapted from a fairy tale. But which one? You'll have to find out! \n\nSYNOPSIS (no spoilers): Today is a festive day in the small village called Schafberg. A talented foundling, raised by a shepherd and his wife on a nearby farm, has come of age, and now the young paragon's adoptive parents have brought their ward to town to speak to the Matron. Before Schafberg can rightly celebrate the birthday, a coming-of-age tradition known as \"the birthday errand\" must be honored, and the Matron reveals what that errand is to be.\n\nBEFORE YOU PLAY:\n\n1. Unzip birthday.rar to your desktop. You should end up with a folder containing five items�two copies of this readme (readme.txt and .doc), the module (The Birthday.mod), a campaign folder (\"The Birthday\"), and one file for the .hak folder (birthday.hak). \n\n2. Make certain that you have the most recent patch for the game; this module also requires NWN2�s expansion, Mask of the Betrayer. \n\n3. Put the Birthday.mod in your NWN2 modules folder, located in My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/modules. Do NOT put the file in Program Files/Atari/Neverwinter Nights 2/modules.\n\n4. Put birthday.hak in your .hak folder, located in My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/hak. \n\n5. Put �The Birthday� campaign folder in in your Campaigns Folder, located in My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/Campaigns.\n\nWHEN YOU PLAY:\n\n1. Start a new campaign (*not* a new module). Choose �The Birthday� from the list that appears. \n2. Create a new character. It is important that you choose this option, as using an old character will not take advantage of the deities override.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES AND TIPS:\n\n-This mod looks (and runs) best with SHADOWS OFF. \n-*There is NO RESTING.* You can get all the benefits of resting by talking to Matron Holz when you are in town.\n-*There is NO CRAFTING.* When assigning weapon feats, think �fairy tale.�\n-This mod uses the OC�s DEATH SYSTEM (NO RESPAWNING). Make sure you Quicksave (hit F12) often.\n-You will occasionally hear the sound of drums. This is an indication that you have gained experience for something or other that you have done.\n-This is a SOLO MOD. Melee characters will find it easier; magic-users will find it challenging but do-able (see below). You will level up to sixth level (or the ECL equivalent) upon ending the first conversation. When you are building your character, keep in mind that you are building someone who ought to be able to solo.\n-If your FIRST level is sorcerer, wizard, or warlock, you will find magical item(s) in your inventory that were added to balance the mod for solo magic-users. \n-You may notice that the fairies in the game do not have standard D&D fairy attributes (i.e, are not \"fey creatures\" per se). This was a design choice. I know it makes me less cool.\n\nChanges 1.01\n-Made resting not allowed in the forest. Thanks geethree!\n-Made Sieben unkillable by stray fireballs.\nChanges 1.02\n-Tried to improve conversation stability.\nChanges 1.03\n-Added conversations to NPCs in areas where convos sometimes failed to trigger; improved stability of area transition convos\n-Gave Mother Goat a new model (thanks MotB!)\n-Anchored a floating tree\n-Added support for the spirit shaman and favored soul classes\n-The game now automatically exports the PC at endgame (if you don�t die, of course)\n-Enhanced Mother Goat�s combat abilities and techniques\n-Removed a superfluous comma\n-Converted override folder materials into a single .hak\n-Made �The Birthday� into a campaign (for some reason the new MotB races were not integrating properly in a module format)","Rating":8.98,"Votes":148,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"137":{"Name":"Being Good","Author":"Christian Mayr","Submitted":20070428,"Updated":20070601,"Category":"Obsidian Mod Contest","Module Types":"","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Small","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Light","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"01","Categories":"Obsidian Mod Contest","Patch":"1.05","Description":"Being Good\nv1.1\nwritten and composed by Christian Mayr\n\nYou recently graduated at the academy of tear-avoiders and now need to fulfill a mission where you spread the teachings you acquired in countless lessons:\n\nAvoid the tears\nBurst their fears\nMake them smile\nAll the while\n\nAnd all that to get prepared for your destiny: Becoming a fairy godmother!\n\n\nPlayable with any character of any level and any class\n\n\nA little note on design: I know this module is short. But you need to understand that creating something imaginative that keeps in the player's mind and raise it to a level of quality which won't disappoint yourself takes its time. Also I could have made it longer, but I decided to use more or less a way of indirect characterization (like for instance the explanation of the wolf's fear of water) to introduce the characters and their connections to the environment. This makes the game much shorter but is aiming at increasing the intensity of the experience. \n\nAs a few (or a lot?) of you know I'm not a native speaker.

On top of that, it uses non-chronological narrative structure, so prepare to be surprised a bit :)\n","Rating":6.69,"Votes":16,"Awards":[]},"140":{"Name":"The Rampion Champion","Author":"Death Quaker","Submitted":20070429,"Updated":20070429,"Category":"Obsidian Mod Contest","Module Types":"","Scope":"Small","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"03","Gameplay Length":"01","Categories":"Contest Entry; fairy tale; fantasy; adventure","Patch":"1.05","Description":"At the beginning of the popular tale of \"Rapunzel,\" a lesser known adventure takes place: Rapunzel's father-to-be ventures into the garden of the most powerful witch in the land just to get his pregnant wife a vegetable called rampion to eat. �The Rampion Champion� takes this prologue and turns it into an adventure of its own.

Updated with new ending! Play as twins of ANY name!\n\nMask of the Betrayer expansion not required.\n----- \n\nTaking a winding path through a dark forest, you come to the Tower of the White Wizard rising majestically before you. As you enter, you are swept onto a quest that will spell the fate of a whole community. Will you succeed, and get out with the tale you know will make you famous throughout Faerun? \n\n----- \n\nThis mod was originally designed (in 26 days) for the first Obsidian mod contest held in May. The contest�s theme was �The Grimm Tales�. This mod like all contest mods, is a relatively short one, one that makes for a good evening�s diversion from playing some of the larger mods out there. \n\n----- \n\nThe tales known as the Grimm Tales, which are some of the best known folk tales in the world, were collected (and enhanced) by two brothers, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, during their travels in 19th century Germany. \n\nIn Daark Twins, you play as one half of Faerun�s answer to the Grimm Brothers, as they hunt for the tale that would later make their fame from the Sword Coast all the way to Thay. This tale is known as The Wizard and his Creation. \n\nThe Wizard and his Creation, like most popular tales, tells more than it seems to do on the surface. And like these types of tales tend to do, it holds a moral, one you may or may not agree with. \n\n----- \n\nFEATURES \nAppealing exterior and interior areas, non-traditional combat and gameplay, original creatures, amusing dialogue, official campaign player death system, a devious (but optional) gnomish puzzle, at least two possible end games, and a very special guest star. \n\n-----\n\nNOTICE \nIn spite of the new features in this version (see VERSION NOTES below), I still recommend you play with the included Jakob Daark character file, or with a level 5 human.\n\n----- \n\nTHE STORY FROM THE BEGINNING \nOne morning, one much like any other for them, the Daark Twins, tellers and gatherers extraordinaire of Faerun�s most mysterious, most fantastic tales, set out from the hamlet of Anaatnas on the north-western edge of Cormyr's Hullack Forest, bound for the Tower of the White Wizard. \n\nPopular tales in this part of the land vary in their accounts of the White Wizard, but they all hint at strange happenings in the Tower. No one the Twins had met in and around Anaatnas had actually been to the Tower or seen it firsthand. While the Daark Twins do not know what to expect, they are convinced their visit will yield a tale to remember� and tell, again and again and again. \n\nFinally, after wandering through the darkening woods, at times taking one path of a fork only to come back to it half a league later, they came to a clearing. \n\nAcross the clearing, standing next to a small cabin, they saw a bent, old woman beckoning to them. \n\n-----\n\nTHE MEANING OF THE STORY\nThe main story is a loose allegory about the creation of the NWN2 game itself, the conditions of its initial release and the community that has formed around it. There are many references to these aspects of the game, some obscure, others much less subtle. The ending moral could be taken as a commentary on the game (not from me though ;) ) and should be familiar to many NWN2 fans�\n\nA copy of NWN2 is required to play and enjoy, as well as a taste for a bit of (very affectionate) irreverence...:). That said, the module can be enjoyed in its own right, without comprehension of the references it contains. \n\n----- \n\nVERSION NOTES \nV1.21:\n-Fixed a bug that prevented end game from firing in specific circumstances.\n\nV1.2:\n-New, more challenging, more climactic ending.\n-Play with any character, with any last name (level 5 recommended): your twin will be of the opposite sex and take your last name. Conversations will reflect your names properly.\n-UNSUPPORTED FEATURE: If you decide to play with an elf, dwarf, halfling, half-orc, half-elf or gnome then your twin will take on the appearance of the base race of your PC ( e.g. drow will get a basic elf twin. Sorry, outsiders not supported.). This adjusts the appearance of the twin only, not its stats sheet. Current functions make more precise matching too burdensome.\n- A few other tweaks, updates and enhancements.\n\nV1.1: \n- Added companion conversation and �diary-type� journal \n- fixed the �Wizard conversation failed to advance quest status� bug, otherwise known as the Starwars bug (named in honor of the one who first informed me of it :) ) \n- made a few other behind-the-scenes modifications and other small enhancements \n\n-----\n\nI HOPE YOU HAVE FUN PLAYING THIS MOD. PLEASE COME BACK AND VOTE ONCE YOU ARE DONE.

It is a simple single player module, meant to be the start of a better and larger series. This module was added to the module competition because I had nothing better.\n\nIt can not be used properly for multiplayer.\n\nThink of it as a small prelude module.\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\nNothing special should be needed to play this module. The module file (.mod) could be used alone.\n\nPlace the .mod file in your NWN2/module directory and the rest of the optional files in the NWN2/override directory. Make sure you use the My Documents directory, not the game folder. Also, make sure to unpack the .zip file and move the files out of the Spell Fixes directory so that they all are listed un the root of the Override directory.\n\nBut it is highly reccommended to install the optional content, since the D&D 3.5 rules are much better than in the rather hopeless official version.\n\n\nTIPS AND HINTS:\nThis module is not suitable for newcomers to D&D 3.5. It is more difficult than the Official Campaign.\n\nSome classes might have a harder time than others. This does not reflect the overall difficulty for that class for the rest of the series, everyone will have a hard time sooner or later.\n\nMake sure you don't forget to search for treasures, supplies and hidden doors. Things of great help might be found amongst other unusables.\n\n\nSTORY AND SETTING:\nThe little quest is starting in a castle in the Sentian capitol of Corus. You are out of gold and need a job. Fortunately, you are needed, and you have to sneak your way outside of the city walls through a hidden tunnel.\n\nEverything is written down in your journal when you start the module.\n\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\nThe bleeding script is not able to make a bleeding character stay down.

I planned them, but... there was no utility and no time for them. ;) May be next time.\n- There are no PX, allignment changing and \"trust points\" during dialogues. Also if dialogues are very dynamic (I take half of time to write them... in my non-mother language!), them will not let your PC grow or change (but if you read \"[Attack]\", she will attack!).\nHowever that is a RPG module. That's so short that, also with PX awarding, your PC will almost certainly not grow to next level.\nSo, as I sayd, this is a RPG module: you'll have to thinks as if you was your PC and you should answer as she would do.

This introduction act introduces the player to this new world and the story.\n\nIn the beginning, there were only 3 kingdoms: Ryn'skel, home of the humans supported by their mighty heroes; Teran, home of the goblinoids and Nyreld, home of savage demons. As expected, a war broke out between the 3 lands. One that did not resulted in victory but in death. In the tower of Rynal, the capital of Ryn'skel where the final battle between the demons, goblinoids and humans was fought, the humans were in the losing camp and saw only one option left. They went up all the way up to the tower, where they casted a spell from the Forbidden Book. The explosion following destroyed everyone and everything in its radius and caused a negative energy portal to be created. Only one tribe of goblins survived and retreated themselves into the inhospitable mountains of Avadur. The demons suffered from the heaviest losses. Their whole land was destroyed and completely swallowed, creating the Inner Sea. Life in Arryth was as good as gone. This period of war and destruction is now addressed by many as the 'Chaos'. \n\nNow, 812 years later. Waking up in a tavern somewhere in Alauria with memories of a terrible night where you almost got murdered, you find yourself lost and broke. Soon though, you will realize there is something more going on and you will have to fight for not only your survival. A past Arryth would rather forget returns after so many years. The storyline will tell about the dark times coming to Arryth and how all is linked to the mysterious portal of Rynal. What lies on the other side?\n\n\nThe module is best started with a completly new character (level 1).\nContains roughly 1 hour of gameplay, depending on how many sidequests you take.\n\nI hope it won't be needed, but any bugs can be reported to admin@scorgar.be or via this form.

The Browser again offers potential future-proofing and will automatically include additions to the vfx_persistent.2da and visualeffects.2da files. This means that provided the data is reliable you won't have to wait for an update when Mask of the Betrayer is released: you can start browsing all the new effects immediately. It will also automatically pick up resources from the Override directory and could be adapted to work with a campaign folder or a hak pack.\n\nPlease note that despite my best efforts and a lot of validation checks it has not been possible to eliminate all invalid or incomplete effects from the NWN1/NWN2 hybrid data. Faced with this situation I thought it better to leave in a few invalid/incomplete effects in, and hope OEI fixes the data in a future patch, than to hard code exceptions that might subsequently require the Browser to be updated. Beam effects are an example of this issue as all of the NWN1 silent versions appear to be valid but do not actually display anything. \n\nUpdates\n\nVersion 1.01 the Visual Effects Browser can now display all the core SEF files (i.e. those found in the NWN_VFX_* zip files). Users can browse these effects using a portion of the file name, by package (NWN2, NX1, NX2) or using a portion of the category (the sub-directory structure used to organise the files).\n\nUnfortunately as this feature currently relies on a custom 2DA file it will not automatically update itself. I hope to release a standalone application in due course that will allow users to create and maintain their own version of the 2DA file, however in the meantime I'll update and upload a new version of the 2DA file any time new SEF files are added.\n\nGetting Started \n\nDownload Sunjammers_Visual_Effects_Browser_v1.01.zip and unzip it into the My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Modules\\ directory. Start NWN2; open Sunjammer's Visual Effects Browser and click on the Browser Menu button or placeable to start searching for your favourite effects.\n\nFurther Information \n\nThere are some brief but, hopefully, informative notes in the header section of the browser_inc script. Even if you are not a scripter it's worth taking a peek at them if you need a little extra guidance.\n\nAlternatively you have any questions, suggestions or constructive comments in the meantime please let me know here, on the NWN2 Forums, or via my website.","Rating":9,"Votes":11,"Awards":[]},"151":{"Name":"Night Howls in Nestlehaven V1.17","Author":"jackyo123","Submitted":20070505,"Updated":20080510,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"City Adventure","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Large","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Heavy","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"09","Max Character Level":"14","Gameplay Length":"06","Categories":"NWN2 English Modules","Patch":"1.06","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Release Version 1.17 ju31a3- July 31, 2007 \n\na story driven, single player campaign (part 1 of an expected 2 or 3) - for character levels 9-14. Balanced for play on 'Hard' (normal D&D rules) mode, with full Area of Effect damage rules from friendly fire enabled (you can spam your way through with mass fireballs too easily with 'normal' rules enabled - if you prefer an easier combat game, then choose 'Normal' rules or, better yet, play with a level 14 character).\n\n\nStoryline - you are a semi-retired, moderately successful mercenary who has settled down to a relatively quiet life in the countryside. You then receive a last call to action - a plea from the Constable of Nestlehaven - a small city-state west of Neverwinter and just north of the Kryptgarden Forest on the Sword Coast...\n\nCharacter info - if your character has less than 42,000 XP, you will be advanced to 42k - thats approx level 9. AT THE END OF THE MOD YOUR CHARACTER GETS AUTOMATICALLY EXPORTED.\n\nAll items are stripped out - but placed in loot bags, in case you want the items post-game (or if you want to use them in the mod - but this may upset the balance). Your character gets exported automatically at the end of the game. There is a goodly collection of items, appropriate to a level 9 or 10 character, in your starting base. You can find everything you need to finish the mod (many 'better' quality items are available in side-quests or private homes) at approx level 11/12 (assuming you started at level 9).\n\nMod is difficult for level 9/10 players. Major tactics and frequent resting should be required. \n\nModerate challenge for level 11/12, some tactics, frequent resting, and trap-laying might be required. \n\nShould be straight-forward for levels 13/14. \n\nNPC's will join you as you progress. They all have personalities, and will discuss with you what they think of you, your progress, and your other companions.\n\nThe things you do in-game, and your choices re: alignment, will *matter*. There is a very large alignment-based quest-set. You will also begin laying the groundwork for later-on joining a faction. If you anger a certain faction too-much, or do things contrary to their interests, you will have very little chance of joining them later (there are 4 factions you can join - 3 of which are clear in part 1).\n\nThere are many 'skill' checks - some occur openly (such as in conversations) and others don't (such as spotting tracks and having certain conversation paths and choices available to you later).\n\n\nThere is an existing 'economy.' You cant just sell everything you buy to the first merchant you see. They all have limited amounts of gold (there are 9 merchants) so you will find that you need to balance your sales with purchases (maybe selling the loot you don't need for an item you do). Most of the higher level items are found in side-quests, private homes, or some of the 'shadier' stores.\n\nYou should be able to play - and enjoy the mod - as any character build. The only NPC I 'force' on you, and just for a short while, is a Rogue w/ high Magic Use abilities. She can be dismissed about midway through the mod if you don't want her around anymore (but if you aren't playing a thief, I advise you to keep her!).\n\nTotal playtime if you stick mainly to the main storyline - about 5 hours. If you do all the sidequests/private homes/etc (there are a lot, and not all are obvious) and talk to all the different people you meet - approx 8 hours.\n\nPossible Bugs and Problems:\n1> There are a few areas where you have keys to open doors-the keys MUST be on the character who will be doing the opening\n2>Certain 2da files or other things in your override directory can interfere with or break the journal and/or some of the placeables (just like with any mod that uses custom stuff).

The occassional crash for some people is caused (I believe) by numerous sound overlays, or rapid 'clicking' by users trying to skip the fade to black's, which, even at minimum delay, is several long seconds on some computers. I cannot replicate this crash, so I cannot be certain what causes it, but at least a half-dozen people have had it. Some people have reported that dismissing everyone from your party right before the challenge works - you can get all your party members back at the Merc n Mead, so it might be worth trying if you want to do the arena fight but are having the crash problem.\n\nin the Sage Tower (or anywhere)- if you find your party is not following you - simply do a BroadCast command 'Follow-Me' and they will follow-again. This is apparently sometimes an engine bug, as I had it occur to me in the OC as well.\n\nPLEASE let me know of any other bugs - I got hit pretty hard with 1.06 introducing a lot of unexpected behaviors (new perception scripts really did a whammy, as I was very careful about placing enemies at the edges of certain perception ranges, and on giving every encounter a barkstring combat convo, which required major script overhauling to fix) and I want to put part1 to rest so we can move full-speed on part2.\n\n\n\nThanks everyone for playing!\n\n\nI have included, in the zip file, my Spreadsheet that I used to plan the mod. It has four or five workbook 'tabs' at the bottom of the sheet - these contain script names that are used, which scripts do what, when things execute, variables used and tracking info, all quest states and quest state info, location of all doors, whats behind them, where they lead to, etc.\n\nI've included this to help any would-be mod builders understand what I did, where I did it, what is executing, etc. I only wished I had something like this when I first started learning (by pulling apart, piece by piece, the mods that make up the OC campaign, and then making changes to them, to see what resulted). If you like the way I did something, then this spreadsheet can help you find the associated scripts, convos, and variables that I used to do it. The more modders in the community, the better off we all are. If you are just starting out, I also recommend you read one of the tutorials that are here on the vault('Dont Panic' guide, NWN2 Toolset guide, some of the 'movie' tutorials, etc) and spend some time on the bioware forums, the citadel forums, and other community resouces.\n\nEnjoy!!!\n\nemail - jackyo123@yahoo.com","Rating":9.28,"Votes":356,"Awards":["Hall of Fame","ReviewersAward.jpg"]},"152":{"Name":"Haunted House","Author":"Mi'kile","Submitted":20070511,"Updated":20070512,"Category":"Single Player OR Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Module Types":"","Scope":"Small","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"04","Gameplay Length":"01","Patch":"1.05","Description":"Haunted House V0.5\n\nIn passing through a village you find it oddly deserted except for a light in the window of the hedge wizards home.

For the most current version, see:\nLink\n\nAll further updates and issues will be addressed there.\n\n\n\nThe Subtlety of Thay, an adventure for characters level 3 to 5...\n\n\"It only takes one man to change history, one man to spark the fires of a cataclysm. This has been \na universal truth since the dawn of time. Tensions are high on both sides of the Watchwall, and an uneasy truce \nhas developed between the lands of Thay and Aglarond. It only takes one man to destroy that truce...and he will gaze\nout at the world from atop a mountain of corpses, and those closest to the flame that sparked that will be consumed. That \nis a fact. Of course, it will only take one to change that fact...\n\nWill you?\"\n\nThe Subtlety of Thay is a single player campaign spanning roughly 8 hours for characters starting from levels 3 to 5, of any \nrace and class. Challenge will depend on a number of factors, from class, ECL race, and skill level. \n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\n\nThis is a little different than NWN1.\n\n\nWhen you extract the files from the archive (.rar file you downloaded), you need to do two things. It's absolutely important that you install\nthis correctly or it won't work properly and you're likely to run into a lot of bugs, even if you don't notice right away.\n\nThe folder called \"The Subtlety of Thay\" goes into your Neverwinter Nights 2/campaigns folder. This folder is found either where you installed the\ngame, or under the My Documents area of your computer. The default location of each is C:\\Documents and Settings\\My Documents\\Campaigns (there's also usually\na link to it in your start menu), and for the other location C:\\Program Files/Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns. If you installed it elsewhere or moved the \npath to My Documents, you probably don't need my help with that.\n\nThe two .mod files, called typart1.mod and typart2.mod go in the modules folder. This is in the same directory as the campaign folder, just a little \nlower down the list.\n\nTo start a new game, start NWN2 and click the \"New Campaigns\" button. If you're starting it from the \"New Modules\" button, you're doing it wrong.\n\nAlso, I highly suggest using the Program Files location. On some computers, mine included, the My Documents location doesn't work. If you installed it as\nabove and you're having problems, you're probably one of those people. You'll know you did it right if the campaigns folder contains the OC folder, and \nthe modules folder contains a dozen or so modules that start with the number 0 and bear a remarkable resemblance in name to some of the locations found in\nthe OC.\n\nv1.13+\n-----\n\nThe folder named SoTOverride goes into your override folder, located in C:\\Documents and Settings\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\OVerride or C:\\Program\nFiles\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override, or whever you installed the game. This is required to view the updated models being utilized throughout the next and \nfurther chapters of the campaign. The reason I chose an override instead of a hak or campaign folder is simply because you can carry the items with you to \ndifferent modules and not have to view a floppy hat or box with a question mark. It will not override any of the base Obsidian models in either the OC or \nexpansion.\n\nNote on the override:\n\nA lot of people hate on this folder like it's a bad thing to use; it's not, when builders use it responsibly. As always, empty it before patching the game \nto avoid problems! But for things like this, it's relatively harmless and allows builders a lot of flexibility as well as allowing you, the player, to use, \nfor instance, the items I've spent countless hours making and to actually see the models created by the talented community in the hands of the PC instead of \nwatching all the NPCs looking all bad while you're stuck with the default stuff.\n\n\nThings to know for character design:\n------------------------------------\n\n-Nearly every skill is used at some point in the campaign. For instance, a high lore skill will allow your character dialogue options\nthat account for knowing, ironically, a lot of lore about the world and facts about the world around them. Likewise, diplomacy can convince\nothers to do what you want them to, and you can scare them into doing what you want with Intimidate. However, these checks are hidden, so pay\nattention to your conversation options.\n\n-Alignments shifts are fairly frequent, and result from either your words or your actions. If you want to play a Paladin, you'll probably have to\nlimit your ruthless murdering. There is also Neutral shifts. They look odd in the game, but are always accompanied by a final \"your alignment has shifted\ntowards neutral. You should also be careful how you speak to strangers, because your companions might not like the way you treat people either!\n\n-You get XP for you or your companions unlocking objects and disarming traps, as well as successful skill checks. A skilled character can bypass a lot \nof combat and still get rewards where an unskilled character couldn't, if you are diligent in seeking out places to test yourself.\n\n-Companions can be multiclassed, as well as influenced by your actions and words. You can control this through dialogue. If they ask for your advice, \nbeing harsh will result in them shifting towards evil, and telling them to be more free spirited will make them chaotic, for example, as well as unlocking \nhidden classes for them to take when they level up. Talk to them frequently, they have things to say about the area you are in or new dialogue based off \nof how much they like you, and to check to see if they have any new classes available that might be helpful to you. They are also gender neutral, meaning \nthat they will react to you regardless of who your character is.\n\n-There are over 200 custom items in the campaign. Not all are available in stores and can be found randomly in treasure. There are also many new and \nuseful potions and wands available in stores. Take advantage of these, a potion of Mage Armor can mean the difference between life and death in a deep \nand unforgiving dungeon, especially since it's not safe to rest everywhere.\n\n-At the same time, though, stores don't sell everything under the sun. A character with a specialized weapon may not be able to find their preferred \nweapon immediately, and since the treasure is random, perhaps never. You may have to look to other, less legal, merchants that find goods from far away \nlands...\n\n-There are some dungeons that once you enter, the only escape is forward, and sidequests can't be completed past certain points in the timeline. Always \nbe prepared when you enter a new area, you never know what you'll face and having a stock of helpful items and items to bypass damage resistance will save \nyour life. Saving often is also recommended.\n\n\n-Some sidequests block off other sidequests. This is especially true in upcoming releases for the series. If you want to experience the full game, you'll \nhave to play at least twice!\n\n-For a balanced character, try Berliad's character creator. Since this campaign is part of the Forgotten Realms Weave, it is balanced around the same \nstandards used by his character creator.\n\n-Just remember that crafting is not supported!\n\nLink\n\n\nNote from the Author:\n---------------------\n\nHi, this is dirtywick. Thanks for downloading and playing my campaign. It wasn't all me, though. The people over at the NWCitadel(http://nwcitadel.com/forums/index.php?styleid=18&Itemid=54)\nhelped me test the mod out and gave a lot of useful suggestions for improving it. So, here goes the list: Thanks to Phoenixus for a lot of general help, \nLord Niah for helping with his base mod and scripting, Mungo_D for the spellchecking, Aristan for extensive testing, Anduraga for the same, and everyone else \nthat supported or took an interest. Especially to those cats reading my blog, much love goes out to you as well. Also thanks to Montgomery Markland from \nRogue Dao, be sure to check their drop when it's ready. Thanks goes out to the BiObsidian boards for any scripting and toolset help. Thanks goes out to \nPatcha for the sitting system used by the FRW Base Mod. I also bookmarked this secret door script I saw on the scripting board that I lost when I got a \nnew OS on the computer, so sorry to not name you but I love ya all the same!

The last habitable piece of the penninsula to survive the catastrophic blast that destroyed the last major force of the Ilmarid Legion, as well as the land on which it stood at the time, Tinara is the refuge of thieves and smugglers.

Amongst the thieves, pirates, and smugglers that frequent the island, not many questions are asked of you as long as you follow orders.

No plot or quests, only battles against NPC. You will find 114 NPC recreated as closed as possible from the original ones ( lvl, stats, hp, spell ...), gathered in 42 different encounters. By your side, you can have 3 of the 25 BG1 companions.\n\n How it works :\n\n- The module is made for a new character (lvl 1). You will get 100 gp at the beginning for your equipment. The encounters are intended to be done in the proposed order as the difficulty is increasing with it.\n\n- There are 4 areas. In the first one, you will find all the companions, a store (speak with Taerom), and Gorion, with who you can choose an encounter. The encounters are classified in chapters as those of BG1. The 3 other areas contain the enemy you choose to fight with.\n\n- Gorion : Speak with him to choose an encounter, he will indicate you a door (blue, green or brown), go to it to join the battle area.\n\n- Companions : You can have 3 with you. Speak to them and accept their proposition to add them to your roster. Next, you can add them in the group when you open a door, or just by opening the roster UI in the esc menu. They have the same lvl as yours. Unfortunately, they are not multiclassed as in BG1. \n\n\n- The battle areas : One is in exterior, one in interior, and one in a cave. In the exterior one, you have enough space to buff before the fight, but not in the 2 others. The exits bring you back to the entrance area with Gorion.\nLeaving an area will destroy all it contains, NPC and items on the ground ! So you can't flee a fight and come later to finish it. be sure to Loot all you want before leaving.\n\n- Difficulty : You can begin with a lvl 1 character, with all the encounters, you'll finish near lvl 10-11. Most of the first fights are quite difficult (even in 4vs1) and a good roll can be very important. After the fights of the 1st chapter, they're more easy, but some are though without good buffs.\n\n- Death : As in the OC, if 1 survived, the others come back to life.\n\n- enemies : Most are as in BG1. They drop all their equipment when dead. I add some heal spells to the clerics. Wizards cast the lvl 2 spell fear in the chapter 1 and 2, and then the lvl4 equivalent to increase the difficulty and pass the lvl limitation.\n\n\nHave fun !Noon\n\nP.S: I apologize for any error in the texts, i'm not a pro in translating ;) .\n\nUpdate 07/14/2007: Add a description for each companion with the race and class.\n\nLink to the french version / version française: Link","Rating":5.92,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"167":{"Name":"CNR (Craftable Natural Resources) for NWN2","Author":"Festyx & Hrnac (original NWN1 authors) Olblach,[MD]Sephiroth & charlievale (NWN2 adaptation)","Submitted":20070708,"Updated":20101103,"Category":"No Story (Ex: Resource, Level ups, etc.)","Module Types":"Tutorial","Scope":"NA","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"NA","Roleplay":"Nonexistent","Hack & Slash":"Nonexistent","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"01","Categories":"Testing/Development","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This is a test module I made in order to adapt CNR (Craftable Natural Resources) for NWN2. \n\nStill a work in progress, but it doesn't look like it is too much troubles, everything seem to work so far.\n\nMajor concerns are finding the right categories for placeables and items, also fixing the icons and appearances.\n\nThe PWC is for testing on Social Lounge\n","Rating":10,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"170":{"Name":"DM'd Campaign Base Module / Start Area","Author":"Venture","Submitted":20070714,"Updated":20071010,"Category":"No Story (Ex: Resource, Level ups, etc.)","Module Types":"Final Version, Other","Scope":"NA","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"NA","Roleplay":"NA","Hack & Slash":"NA","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"01","Categories":"Base module\nStart area","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"(10/9/07 update: The base module has been upgraded to HCR2 version 1.02 and also inlcude the HCR2 CopyObject & corpse system workaround for patch 1.10.

The module contains the following:\n\n-HCR2 bleeding and death script (NOTE: I changed the HCR Healer's Kit to have unlimited uses a day, to make it more like a healing widget like in HABD. If you want to change it back, set the item properties to 1 charge/use)\n-DMFI tools\n-Mogney's Sleep Activator Widget (set up by me for NWN2). This widget, initially designed by Mogney for NWN, allows the DM to toggle resting off and on.\n-A start area that includes base merchants in one room, some empty rooms, and a crafting area\n-Some base NPCs based off of Storyteller's Norse NPCs.\n-Low level versions of the NWN2 OC companions that can be placed into an area, and asked to join a party. I use them for testing the difficulty of modules. I believe it was Lochlainn's Easy Party Companions that I used to set these companions up.\n-Some extra Lights, such as torch lights, candle light, and campfire.\n\nCredit for all these tools, except the start area, goes to the original authors. All I did was add it all into one module, and add a start area. If you notice something I forgot to mention, let me know so that I can credit the author.

Choose from 5 companions, with one romance option per gender (not fully explored in this chapter).

I wanted it more to feel like a story about the growth of a hero/villain, rather than the standard adventurer that starts out skinning rats in someone�s basement. A story the player could shape and unfold around his PC.\n\nDark Avenger is designed for a PC of any alignment/gender/race/class with an ECL of 4. PCs with less than 6000 XP will be levelled up at the start of the game. Equipment will be stripped, but can be reacquired at the end of the introduction � up to the player how much is used. By the end of the chapter (~2-3 hours), you will have gained roughly 3 levels, depending on how much you explore.\n\nPlease check out the ReadMe/Walkthrough before designing a character.\n\nINSTALLATION\n============\nUnzip the file to your NWN2 Campaigns directory, find the dark_avenger.mod file in that folder and move it to the Modules directory. Start the game from the New Campaign section.\n\n02/01/08 - Forgaging incorporated. Plants can now be gathered and used to produce items that may be helpful. Smear Extract of Brown mold on your weapon to give the enemy a suprise. Gather Retch Plant spores for use as choking powder.

See plant descriptions for more information.\n\nNOTE TO PLAYERS - if you are hoping to play the rest of the series with a character from this mod, please keep a copy of the save game.

You can relive these tales as Conan, or as a hero of your own design, following your career from its beginning as a youth among the Aesir, to your eventual rise to claim the throne of Aquilonia, the most powerful Hyborian kingdom.\n\n\"Legions of the Dead\" describes the first recorded exploits of the young Conan, when as a youth of sixteen summers he fled his home in Cimmeria to join with a band of Northern barbarians in the frigid land of Asgard. The original short story was written by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, based of course on the collection of Conan stories by Robert E Howard. It pre-dates the more well-known \"Tower of the Elephant\" which is, taking the chronology of Conan's career, the first Howard story. The fact that \"Legions\" deals with a very inexperienced Conan, and the fact that the story is less well known, makes it a good start for a chronology.\n\n\nInstallation\n\nDON'T put anything into the Program Files NWN2 folders where the core game information is kept!!\n\nDownload and unzip the part 1 and part 2 module files (\"Legions of the Dead part 1.mod\" and \"Legions of the Dead part 2.mod\") and put the mod files into your My documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/modules folder.\n\nDownload and unzip the \"Conan Chronicles Extra Files\" zip folder and put the folder called \"Conan Chronicles 1\" found inside the campaigns subfolder into your My documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/campaigns folder.

Put the conan.tlk file in the Legions of the Dead part 1 zip into the My documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/tlk folder.\n\nNotes for Players (see the readme)\n\nFrom 4th May 2008, I have uploaded new versions of this game to be compatible with subsequent games in the Conan Chronicles Series.\n\nThe game is designed for a single starting PC. Playing a human is more suitable for this adventure, but not required. If you really want to play a Cimmerian Gnome, feel free.\n\nAt the start of the game, you should create a PC and note that you can select \"Hyborian Race\" to choose from one of 11 subraces of the Hyborian Age. These subraces and their bonuses and penalties are described in game, in the create menu and in the walkthrough document.\n\nThere are a number of features specific to the game ( more information in the walkthrough):\n\nTime. Time travels as in real life i.e. 60 minutes in an hour, not 2 which is the NWN standard! Instead, journeys between certain outdoor areas take time, perhaps 4 hours. Also resting takes time; 5-6 hours for a full rest.\n\nCompanions. There is a companion for part of this game. You can leave and rejoin this companion as desired, and she retains the equipment you left her with.\n\nResting. You cannot initiate resting while controlling a companion. Rest and your companion will rest with you. You may rest in most areas and abort by clicking out of the blue screen. In many areas, wandering monsters may run into you, appearing at a random location nearby. Depending on your survival skill, you may be surprised and unable to act for several seconds. There may be special safe-rest areas in game, perhaps after you have defeated certain encounters. Sometimes resting in a corner or in a small room with the door closed may allow you to avoid an encounter.\n\nDeath. You will not be able to defeat all encounters. There are also some story choices that inevitably lead to death. Sometimes you may be able to respawn back to a point before this choice, but not always. If you die, you usually respawn in the same place with full abilities back, but a hefty xp penalty. However, your mission is rescue based and if you allow your companion to die, its game over, so look after the companion well!\n\nThievery. Sneaking around and using your wits to avoid encounters is encouraged. Looting every single item from containers in front of their owners� noses is not! If you get spotted, expect non-hostiles to get hostile. But you can steal if you want to, just try and do it without being seen, and if you run away when you are spotted, those that see you often calm down after a while. If you get spotted too often, however, the whole faction turns against you.\n\nTreasure. There are custom treasure scripts used which give a wide variety of random treasures or basic items. Feel free to loot all you like, but it is not the main focus of the story, and although merchants are present in one area, there are only rather basic supplies to be purchased by and large. Please don�t get too attached to all your stuff. Otherwise you might get upset at the end of the game�\n\nCustom Items. There are a few custom potions, items and consumables which should be self-explanatory. Some may not work in other modules, but will work in future Conan modules.\n\nSecret Doors. There are secret walls that move aside once you discover them, and then you can actually interact with them to close them or open them as desired. There are also secret catches or levers opening secret doors in walls.\n\nLooking up. In one area (should be obvious) you need to look up. Use driving camera mode in that circumstance.\n\n\nNote for Builders\n\nFeel free to take this module apart for techniques and ideas to use in your own adventures. Part of the idea behind this module was to encourage other builders. Hopefully then you will not have to replicate all the long work it took to get this module functioning with its custom features. And feel free to design your own better solutions!\n","Rating":8.93,"Votes":116,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"178":{"Name":"The Corruption of Kiahoro","Author":"human_male","Submitted":20070823,"Updated":20120728,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Heavy","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"06","Gameplay Length":"12","Categories":"Quest based, story driven adventure.

Tucked away in the southeast corner is the tiny, insignificant and completely overlooked Kiahoro County. Overlooked until now, that is. Sinister and murderous forces are at work and the besieged residents will need all your strength and courage if they are to survive.\n\nAs you make your way along the road toward the town of Kiahoro, you come across a travelling halfling merchant, who seems to be having a spot of trouble.\n\nNOTES: \n\nThis mod may not be suitable for younger gamers due to some mild grown up content.\n\nTip: You might want to save some gold for one or two of the quests.\n\nRequires both Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir.\n\nIf you enjoy the mod, play the sort of sequel, Traveller.\n\nSign posts act as area transitions.\n\nParty chat box used for aesthetic purposes only.\n\nThe dungeons are dark. Really dark. You'll finally have a use for your Dark Vision and all those torches and light spells that are totally useless in the commercial games.\n\nSingle player, recommended for levels 1-6. It's intended to be very challenging for the equivalent of a THIRD level default fighter, starting with basic gear and no gold (on hardcore D&D rules) with the rogue and cleric companions in your party (you're going to need a rogue). It's up to you to decide what level to play at based on your class and how tough you like it. For weaker classes likes bards and rogues I suggest playing at level 5 or 6 or taking all three companions with you (a second level cleric, a third level fighter and a third level rogue). If you find it too easy, don't take as many companions. There should also be enough loot to buy all the potions you need for buffing.\n\nThis mod is very dialog intensive. There's plenty of fighting too, but if you don't like wading through a lot of dialog it might not be for you.\n\nThere is a bug where you may not be able to recover your own traps, and traps may not even go off when an enemy hits them. I have no idea what causes this or what to do about it. Sorry.\n\nI tried hard to balance the loot and gold that's available. I didn't want this mod to make you rich and overpowered with high end stuff. All of the merchants have a fairly limited amount of gold on them as they live in a remote backwoods area (you're going to find they may not have enough gold to buy all your loot). Most of the stuff in the game is mundane, with a few +1 things and one or two +2. There's a merchant who sells a few higher end bits and pieces to give you something to spend your gold on.\n\nYou will find there's very little magic and magic stuff in this mod. The reason for that is I don't have an interest in magic and have never played a magic using character. So I have no real idea what items and spells would be appropriate for the levels this mod's aimed at. I hope that it's still playable for a magic user, though. There's a magic shop so you should be able to buy what you need, but if you find you have trouble or you don't enjoy it because of that I am truly sorry. That was not my intention. It is my hope you might actually get a kick out of being one of the only three wizards in the game.\n\nThis is my first mod of any kind, for any game. I did all I could to make it as good as I possibly could. But with my limited knowledge of the toolset (and no knowledge at all of scripting) and not being a professional writer or anything it's obviously not perfect. But I hope you enjoy it. I'd like to thank my beta testers fenixphire25 and potatocubed, Gilthonym and NWNmaster for their tutorials, Berliad for letting me pinch a script from his character creator and all the people on the Bioware NWN 2 message boards. I certainly couldn't have done this without you.\n\nAs always feedback and bug reports appreciated.\n\nIf you have any problems feel free to email me at aww_bummer@yahoo.co.nz. Go on, I'm desperate for human contact.\n\nHuman_male (chaotic good commoner), 2007, Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nHuzaah!","Rating":8.82,"Votes":144,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"179":{"Name":"Tears of Ilmarid 1 - Blood of the Fallen, v 2.0.1","Author":"Hohiro Kurita","Submitted":20070824,"Updated":20090823,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Combat, Dramatic, Dungeon Adventure, Final Version","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"10","Gameplay Length":"04","Categories":"Story-driven, single player adventure.","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Since the fall of the Ilmarid Empire 10 years ago in a bloody coup staged by the leader of the Arcane Society, and the destruction of the Tinaran peninsula, you have lived on the island of Tinara.

Amongst the thieves, pirates, and smugglers that frequent the island, not many questions are asked of you as long as you follow orders. It has been peaceful for the last few years, with little news from the mainland.

In your case, the inn was a seedy one on the outskirts of Secomber, and the rumor originated from the mouth of a crusty one-eyed dwarf with breath that reminded you of a flatulent ghast. Between long sips of the ale you bought him, your new friend told you of an enormous crystal structure that had reportedly been glimpsed high up in the Star Mounts, the soaring range of peaks which juts up from the center of the legendary High Forest. When you asked him to elaborate, the dwarf hiccupped once, gently lay his head on the table, and--to your dismay--commenced snoring contentedly. None of the inn's other motley assortment of patrons were able or willing to shed any further light on this intriguing rumor, and when you finally retired for the night, your sleep was a troubled one. Curiosity was eating away at you, tugging mercilessly on something deep down inside...and this time, you suspected there wasn't an accidentally-swallowed piece of shuriken involved.\n\nThe next morning found you heading north, against your better judgment. North, towards the High Forest--and the Star Mounts, with their peaks concealed by an ever-present blanket of dark, swirling clouds. You cannot say what it was about this rumor of mysterious crystals which so appealed to your sense of adventure; in hindsight, it must have been Fate at work. What is certain is that no amount of training or planning could have prepared you for what awaited atop the highest of those mist-clad mountains, or for the logic-defying journey on which you were soon destined to embark.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nNotes\n- This is designed for level 8 character.

So save often.\n- Resting is allowed in most areas, and is unlimited.\n- The game should last anywhere between 9-12 hours depending on personal playing style and number of sidequests completed.\n- A level 8 character should make it to level 13 (give or take 1 either way) by the end of the first chapter.\n- There is an in-game \"Map\" item/feature allowing for fast-travel via dialogue to previously-explored locations (this NEW! as of 10/4/07)\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nLinks:\n\nDevelopment Blog\n\nMoonshadows Home\n\nMoonshadows Screenshot Gallery \n\nEnjoy, and don't forget to vote when you're done! :)\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMysteries of Westgate Available Now!\n\nThe latest Dungeons & Dragons RPG has been released and is now available for download!

You were on your way back home from a successful boar hunt in the forest when you saw him. With torn clothes covered with blood, he slowly staggered down the road. When he saw you he smiled and fell to the ground. You quickly ran to his help and gave him some water. He looked at you and said:\n\n - I come from Threshold. Not that many knows about it yet... but he is back... and soon... it will be... too late.\n\nAnd then it was too late for the poor villager. Dangerous roads, no armor or weapons. A miracle he came this far. You buried the poor man and wondered what he meant, who is back and what is soon too late? Well, there's only one way to find out, and you started your journey to Threshold.\nAnd now, almost a day later you stand in front of the gates to Threshold...\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFeatures:\n\n - Several sidequests\n - Companions (Interchangeable, NWN2-style)\n - Puzzles\n - The \"Clue-Ball\" (Read v1.02 notes)\n - Crafting (Everything needed, lvl 4-6)\n - Level up script for new characters (Incl. items and gold)\n - Custom items (e.g. Magic Compass)\n - And more...\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nv1.01 Notes:\n\n - Open lock skill or Drogrin is no longer necessary to find the human rib\n - Drogrin is cheaper to hire\n - Level up script changed for races with level adjustment\n - Clues added to find the human rib\n - Applied 1.10 patch\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nv1.02 Notes:\n\n - Added the \"Clue-Ball\". I've had a couple of comments about the quests and puzzles being too hard to solve. Hopefully this is the solution.\n\nHow does the \"Clue-Ball\" work?\nIf you're stuck in a quest or a puzzle, stand next to the questgiver or the puzzle and use the \"Clue-Ball\".\nIt will ask you if you want some help. If you accept you will receive a clue that I almost can guarantee will help you solve the quest/puzzle.\nBUT it's not for free! Every clue will cost you 200XP, so use the \"Clue-Ball\" only when it's really necessary!\n\nWhere can I find the \"Clue-Ball\"?\nGrim at Grim's Inn has it. Just ask for it.\n\n - MoTB compatible\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nv1.03 Notes:\n\n - Spelling and grammar corrected (Big thanks to sirchet who did all the work! Salute!)\n - Added some more map points to \"important\" places\n - Changed the XP rewards for puzzles/quests a bit\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nv1.04 Notes:\n\nThis is just a minor patch. I've had some good comments about the mod that I wanted to implement right away.\nI don't want anyone to get stuck in the mod, and hopefully this patch will help.

All packs can be found in the 'orginal hakpaks' section of the NWN2 vault. None of these packs are essential to the game and are completely optional (which is why they are not included here).\n\nVersion 5: Completed 25/11/07 � (Hopefully) Final Tweaks.\n\nAdded Influence and expanded Agrag�s dialogue. As with Epona, please talk to Agrag throughout the game (If you take him as a companion) *Spoiler* Be sure to speak to him before leaving the ritual chamber for the his influence pay-off.\nAdded An auto-level up sequence at the start of the game. Allowing players to take a level 1 character and level it up to level 4.\nAdded a new house are in Stonedale (all houses in Stonedale are now enterable)\nAdded encounter with new NPC in above location.\nAdded Load screens to all areas.\nMade Stonedale a bit more village like and slightly rundown (minor changes).\nRemoved some treasure, reworked Burglar�s catsuit so it now works properly.\nCorrected spelling errors pointed out by Ransom.\nBUG FIX: Mayor Benedict conversation now has several opportunities to receive �Speak To Sharla� quest (this for PCs with low diplomacy skills) and just in case have lowered the diplomacy skill check on Sharla�s conversation.\nBUG FIX: Speaking to father Casmus about Sharla�s sister now only occurs once during the game.\nBUG FIX: Removed some background grass effects from first area, as some people reported they were having difficulty loading the module.\nBUG FIX: Replaced Mummy in tower with Vampire as since updating my drivers, the Mummy caused the game to crash. \nBUG FIX: Finally managed to get Toolset to rename my area names\n\nVersion 4: Completed on 17/11/07 � Tweaks.\n\nAdded Influence to Epona�s dialogue. A happily ever after with Epona is now NOT guaranteed. Make sure to talk to her throughout the game, especially after the main story quest is over. Note, she will NOT automatically leave the party if the wrong things are said to her, but it will affect your influence with Epona (This is not the �official� influence system from OC and MOTB, since I have no idea how that works. This is much simpler).\nAdded portrait for Agrag.\nAdded farewell dialogue to Agrag�s conversation.\nAdded experience points for solving quests without fighting.\nAdded automatic export of character to the end of the module.\nAdded new XP values to several of the creature NPCs in the story.\nAdded the ability to lock pick the door leading to the upstairs of the tavern.

Most buildings can now be entered (some MUST now be entered).\nMoved Sharla from Tavern (to somewhere else).\nPolished all conversations.\nNew areas added (total now stands at 22 as opposed to the previous 16)\nNew conversations added.\nNew companion added.\nNew NPCs added.\nNew Subquest added.\nDay lengthened and night shortened.\nNo respawn available: save often!\nAdded restoration items to Father Casmus's store.\nNew portrait for Epona.\nBUG FIX: Woodland clearing completely redesigned, hopefully clearing up any issues.\nBUG FIX: Sharla will not now give the response that allows you to complete the game UNTIL the main story quest is complete. (This an improved version of the quick fix in version 2)\nBUG FIX: Several adversaries would not give journal update if killed by a companion rather than PC. This is now fixed (or at the very least worked around).\nBUG FIX: Because Goblin caves can now only be entered after accepting appropriate quest, there are no issues with Goblin chieftain not speaking with you.\nBUG FIX: Epona no longer killed/kills all goblins before player can react, this is now encounter driven.\n\nKnown Issues.\n\nFinal Fight: If you resurrect your companions and one of them deals the killing blow, the journal entry will not be given to complete the quest, and you will be unable to complete the game. Please play the final combat as intended, one-on-one.\n\nGrass effects: Since this game is mostly set on moors, there are A LOT of grass effects, these can slow NWN2 or even crash the game. If you are experiencing these problems please go into game options and turn the grass off (preferably before loading the adventure under 'options' on the main title screen).\n\nFloating bowl of flowers: If you bash the armoire in Lorna's cottage rather than pick the lock (you vandals) the flowers on top will remain floating in mid air. I was going to correct it, but the first time I noticed it happen, I thought it funny, so I kept it in. \n \nCurrently I know of no game stopping bugs (if played as intended,see above known issues), though when making this module I did notice that sometimes somethings stopped working for no apparent reason and then would work again next time I playtested. This was very flustrating. I believe that I've fixed everything let me know if otherwise. Either post on the NWN2 vault board or send a mail to crazypella@yahoo.com Also, I'm under no delusions that I've caught every spelling/grammatical error, despite the number of times I playtested the module. Again let me know if you spot any.\n\nWell that's it. I really hope you enjoy A Secret In Stone.

The delays are all drastically reduced, which in the testing case (Marcus talk) helped trigger the dialogue.

Flirt-packs are accessed via the main question menu, where the new option (Flirt with Bishop) will appear. The flirts differ between Act II and Act III. Two or three talks are �hidden� and will appear if certain events occurred and you tried to flirt with Bishop. You do not have to be evil-aligned or have high influence with Bishop to romance him. The mod does not modify the influence over the character, in order not to upset the game�s balance. The last meeting with Bishop still requires high influence with him to eventually obtain a different conclusion. The first lines of NWN1-style talks are voiced, and the cutscenes are fully voiced. \n\nContact Information \nThis mod was created by Domi Sotto (aka Melirinda).

It is not an entertainment module, although NWN2 players will probably find the idea of playing games an entertaining approach to education!","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"This is the first proof-of-concept project from the New Nexus project. (http://newnexus.org). We are out to get a toolset akin to the NWN and NWN2 ones created for teachers everywhere to use to create virtual world content for students. See our website for more information. We've used NWN2 for this demo, and we wanted to share it with the community here. Our thanks to the many forum folks who helped answer questions and give ideas for problem solutions.\n\nThe reason we created this project was to demonstrate the efficacy and viability of learning through a virtual world experience. The primary learning goals of the module, from the chemistry teacher's perspective, were for students to learn (or to reinforce learning) about chemical elements, alloys and the processes of smelting minerals and creating alloys. It was hypothesized that the VW experience would also boost students' interest in the class in general.\n\nThe secondary goals of the module include some historical information, some environmental science and critical thinking, as well as building digital media skills and research skills. Because we were wary of NWN2's multiplayer abilities when we started the project in spring of 2007, we did not make it focus on multiplayer work. But we all feel that that would have been desirable; there are many additional benefits to students working in teams in a VW together. And in some tests, teams of 3-4 were doing fine working together; the software was more stable than we had expected from early reports (in fall of 2006 when the game was released).\n\nThe module is designed to be very open ended and very open to shaping by a teacher with his/her students. We wanted to show that using a VW like this could be effective in many ways or modes, from exploratory, discovery-based learning to goal-driven, specific focus work. So the students' experience is meant to include an introduction from a teacher. The module is NOT meant to be picked up and played without any introduction, although one can do this and learn something. When David Spence tested it with 30 of his chemistry students, he gave them a sheet with columns and rows for each mineral they found, and part of their instruction was to fill in the cells of the columns with info about the minerals. Some of that info came from within the game, and some had to be found through research outside the game.\n\nThe testing both on the East Coast and in California was done in classes, and that is one way VW content could be used (and designed). But it could also be a purely supplementary tool; students could do it at home or in a school computer lab when they had time.\n\nThe choice of NWN2 as a compromise. Obviously, since Neverwinter Nights 2 is made to be a \"medieval fantasy world,\" there are pros and cons to using it as a software platform. But for our proof-of-concept purposes, it works fine. It's limited in its scope, so there are lots of anachronisms in some areas, and there are plenty of \"magic\" oriented things that stand out as not realistic. That's fine since we're just trying to show the viability of a similar VW software platform. -The one thing I really wish we had is some contemporary clothing to put PCs and Nexus characters in. We were lucky to find the \"Shirtless Saga 2\" pack of some clothing that worked great for the late Stone Age and early Bronze Age settings. Kudos to the creators, \"RunnerDuck\" and \"Barrel of Monkeys\".\n\nThe module begins with the concept that gives our larger project its name. The Nexus, the area where the player starts, is set up to be a virtual world experience from the future. So the conceit is as if a student in 50 years could really go (virtually) into the Nexus, they could then travel on to other virtual experiences.\n\nSo this is our first demo for our New Nexus project. We'll keep learning from this one as we move on to more. Thanks for taking a look at it. Please give us your feedback and ideas, preferably via email!\n\nUPDATE: the version 211 mod has added an intro/tutorial area and cleaned up some problems.","Rating":9,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"205":{"Name":"Humble Beginnings","Author":"Jezla9","Submitted":20071202,"Updated":20111021,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Other","Scope":"Small","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Light","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"01","Gameplay Length":"01","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"Humble Beginnings is a mini-module (@ 10 minutes) designed for a new character.\n\nI made this module partly to release something that is actually done and playable. It's just a short little encounter you can play as an initial adventure for a new character. It's not much, but I think it should be good to kill a few minutes and give a chuckle or two.\n\nThere is little or no combat, so character class is not an issue, though there is one part where rogues have an advantage. The dialogue, such as it is, includes options for good and not-so-good characters, though they will not affect your alignment.\n\nNote to mod builders: feel free to incorporate this mini-mod into your own projects as an encounter, etc. If you use it, please give me credit.\n\nInstallation: Just unzip the .mod file into your C:\\User\\Documents\\Neverwiner Nights 2\\modules folder.\n\nUpdated 10/21/11: Resolved character export issue that some players were having. Character should now export one PC convo node before the mod end.\n\nUpdated 3/3/10: Changed the module ending script. Now uses ExportSingleCharacter() instead of ExportAllCharacters(); also diplays a message informing player that the character has been exported. No longer rolls the OEI credits.\n\nUpdated 12/3/07: I've added an ending script which will export the character and roll the OEI credits.\n\nUpdated 1/20/09: I've changed the conversations to NWN 1 style due to the tight onfines of the small areas. I've also fixed the problem with the end module script not firing correctly. Consider this a completed version, though perhaps not a \"final.\"\n\nUpdated 1/27/09: Spelling corrections, added alignment shift, small dialogue additions.\n\nAdditional note: This module is now considered part one of a series I am working on. It will be a series of mini-modules designed to be played between adventures (e.g. play Part 1 first, then play other mods until you reach level 5, then play part two, etc). The parts will eventually unfold into a story of their own.

To play it safe, REMOVE ALL FILES FROM THE OVERRIDE FOLDER!\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW: The story begins in Drawn Swords, a tiny settlement on a crag between the Backlands and Sunset Vale. You had come here with Vroman Horner, an amiable treasure-hunter of about one year�s acquaintance, in order to meet with his brother Manfred; the three of you were to seek adventure together after meeting up. But when Manfred fails to arrive on time, adventure finds you before you can find it. \n\nAided by a stern and lovely paladin of Sune, the good folk of Drawn Swords, and the diffident Vroman, you are soon drawn \ninto a drama of religious conflict, military stakes, and esoteric mystery�only to find yourself, quite unexpectedly, the drama�s key player. \n\nThis is a medium (four- to eight-hour) mod for neutral and good characters. It begins at fourth level. See the Readme for more information on building a character for this mod. \n\nINSTALLATION\nInstallation is easy and does not interfere with any of the OC�s or MotB�s files. It has not been tested for use with other custom content, though. There are two ways to install the game. The first is recommended for most users. The second is for those who have unusual installations that the .exe might not recognize, who dislike executable files, or who run into trouble with the easy installation. (VISTA users: This .exe has not been tested with Windows Vista.)\n\n**Easy Installation**\n1. Unzip harp.rar. You will end up with a folder (H&C Unzipped). \n2. Open H&C Unzipped. Move the campaign folder (Harp and Chrysanthemum)\nto My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns. \n3. Move drawnswords.mod and backlands.mod to \nMy Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\modules. \n4. Run the executable file harp.exe. \n\n**Manual Installation** \n1. Unzip harp.rar. In the folder (H&C \nUnzipped) you should find the following items: \n\nA. A campaign folder (Harp and Chrysanthemum).\nB. Three .bmu files. These are H&C�s custom music files. \nC. One .hak file (harppak.hak).\nD. One .tlk file (harp.tlk).\nE.

Perhaps the game�s most difficult quest. \n\nSaern�s Sharp Swords: Melincourt or any of the other �volunteers� in the \nSword and Dragon Inn. Ianth must be in your party. \n\nDryad�s Fire: Northdark Wood (north); you must find Voeae, the dryad, to \nget this quest. \n\nThe Tomb Guardians: Northdark Wood (south).

Or at least the start of it.\n\nOriginal story, original characters, all in the improved graphics of NWN2.\n\nBUT...there are some things I should note before I get anyone's hopes too high.\n\n1) First off, this is my first module to make with the NWN2 Toolset, ever! Also, all my script programming is self taught, done by trial and error and observing existing scripts. I still haven't discovered everything that the NWN Toolset has to offer, but I gave this my best shot. Constructive criticism is welcomed, of course, and I'll probably be getting a lot of it. Some helpful tutoring would be welcomed as well wherever.\n\n2) This is a Beta version. I Alpha tested this as a Human, Male Paladin, my favorite class, and things seemed to work out well enough. How it works with others, I'm not so sure. I did alter the scripts to make this module Warlock playable, and they seemed to work okay. Not certain at the time of release, however.\n\n3) Don't expect this to play EXACTLY like the original. For example:\na) This module is NOT a tutorial. I'm assuming you already know how to play using the NWN2 controls.\nb) I've eliminated all the lengthy tutorial conversations. Bim was pretty much all this, so he doesn't make an appearance.\nc) Pavel is a fully controllable companion. He doesn't gain any exp or levels, but he'll be gone by the end of the mod.\nd) Dismissing Pavel causes him to respawn at spot where you first joined up instead of where you dismissed him.\n\n4) This is just the Prelude. The mod ends when you exit the Stables.\n\n5) Some assembly required. Please follow the instructions in the readme. You'll also need your own copy of NWN1 in order to see the opening and closing movies. This is not meant to be a copyright challenge, so I won't be making everything availible online.\n\n6) Lastly, don't expect a remake of Chapter 1 to be released anytime soon, and please don't ask me for an ETA, 'cause I don't know. I'm just one guy who's trying to start college, and I have enough pressure from real life as it is.\n\nI hope you all enjoy taking this trip down memory lane as you explore the NWN Academy. Seeing Aribeth, Fenthick, Desther, and even Pavel, in a new way really brushed the dust of this personal favorite of mine. Hey, it was the first module I ever finished. That's got to count for something, right?\n\nMy thanks go out to Nytir for the excellent rendition of Aribeth's armor. To Cyric_the_Dark for the Yaun-ti reskin. And of course to the Bioware team for making the original NeverWinter Nights.\n\nWARNING!!!\nThis module has two points where it auto-saves the game! If you want to keep your current auto-save file, say, one for another mod, back it up before playing!\n\n=======================================\nUpdate 01/05/08: Some bugs debugged, at the ones I figured out how to fix.\n1) Pavel will speak more slowly when saying good-bye.\n2) Olgerd has learned the wisdom of finishing a conversation before opening shop.\n3) Herban has gotten over his predjudice of monks and now accepts them as fighters.\n4) Ketta will no longer speak in the cryptic code of \"repeat one thing and mean something else.\"\n5) Desther advised Fenthick that they should put away their crossbows before speaking, and, of course, Fenthick listens.","Rating":8.68,"Votes":23,"Awards":[]},"219":{"Name":"Module Event Tagged Module v1.01","Author":"Kaedrin","Submitted":20080103,"Updated":20080110,"Category":"No Story (Ex: Resource, Level ups, etc.)","Module Types":"Tutorial","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"NA","Content":"NA","Tricks & Traps":"NA","Roleplay":"NA","Hack & Slash":"NA","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"01","Patch":"1.11","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"v1.01\n\nThe goal of this module is to give module developers a clean module with the events already registered so that community content will work without any changes needed.

This can be used for custom feats dependent on what gear you are wearing.\n\n\nOn Player Level Up Script - This is a critical event that is fired each time the player levels up so taht any additional work can be done on the player leveling up (such as granting new spellbook feats, etc).\n\nOn Player Rest Script - This is a critical event that is fired each time you rest and is ideal for resetting custom feats to a specific number.\n\nOn Player Unequip Item Script - This is a critical event that is fired every time you unequip an item. This can be used for custom feats dependent on what gear you are wearing.\n\nOn Player Respawn Script - This event is fired after you come back from death and is typically where a death penalty is assessed.\n\nOn Unacquire Item Script - This event is fired when an object is lost/moved from an objects inventory.","Rating":9.75,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"220":{"Name":"A Veil Lifted","Author":"Allyndn the Beggar","Submitted":20080107,"Updated":20080622,"Category":"Single Player OR Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Module Types":"Combat, Dramatic, Puzzles, Roleplay, Various Settings","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"09","Max Character Level":"13","Gameplay Length":"04","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"A Veil Lifted is an epic journey wherein you will be contracted to retrive a rare item and return it to a remote monastery. \n\nWhile ideally suited for a single PC of roughly tenth level, I have made efforts to make the module multiplayer compatible with a few caveats (see the ReadMe file for full details). \n\nThe module features quirky NPCs, strategic combat, breathtaking set design, scripted cut scenes, and even a few puzzles. \n\nI have also been adapting this module to a comic book, which can be read at Link \n\nFebruary 2, 2008: updated to version 1.1.

If you've ever wondered how your character build concept would fare against the likes of the Iron Sorcerer, Kaze no Kama, or Lord of the Mountain, Battle of the Builds will allow you to test your character's kung fu against theirs. You can even pit the NPCs against each other in one-on-one combat and watch the ensuing debacle in relative comfort and safety.\n\nThis is not an adventure module. There is only one NPC whom you may talk to, the Arena Master. At your command, he will arrange gladiatorial fights for you, give you experience points, and offer you the kind of gear that you may buy, loot, or craft in both the Original Campaign and Mask of the Betrayer. You may then pit your PC against any of the power builds to determine the PC's strengths and areas of improvement. The ultimate objective of this module is for you to test your character build concept against other epic builds or to test how these builds would fare against each other.\n\nIt is highly recommended that a good AI routine be installed for testing your character builds. This module works very well with Tony_K's AI.\n\nBattle of the Builds may be of interest to the following types of people:\n Powergamers who want to test their character build concepts\n\n Builders seeking inspiration for deadly NPCs to put in their modules\n\n Scripters who want to look at some examples of special combat AI\nWanna play as one of the power builds of the Arena?\nIf you think you can control any of the characters in this module better than the AI, you're probably right, but you'll never really know until you try. Now you can download the Power Builds of the Arena and play them as PCs. Take your favorite gladiators for a test drive and see how you like them.\n\n\nWhat's new in version 1.23.1 Fixed a problem regarding the Quest Journal not displaying the stats of the current set of gladiators.\n\n Recompiled some scripts to address the issue of PC clones not disappearing when a fight is canceled.\n\n Note: Edition 2.7.1 of \"Meet the Power Builds\" has corrections on the armor class and saving throws of several power builds as well as on the leveling guide of the Epic Arcane Trickster.\nWhat else is new in version 1.23 Added the following new power builds: Left Fist of Gond, Pointy Stick, Right Fist of Gond, and Terracotta Soldier.\n\n Updated the Divine Soul to JeminiZero's version 3.\n\n Added an option to toggle the notorious weapon-grabbing tactic of gladiators that can disarm their opponents. Note that this won't necessarily prevent weapons from automatically landing in a gladiator's inventory through successful use of the Improved Disarm feat.\n\nAdded an option to limit fast buffing only to spells and feats with a duration of 24 hours or more.\n\nMade several improvements to the AI.\nChanges in version 1.22 Improved the AI of all NPCs, particularly the rangers, bards, non-caster gladiators, and the Blood Scholar.\n\n Fixed a bug that was sometimes causing NPCs not to fight even when they can see their opponents.\n\n Fixed a bug that was causing NPCs not to pick up their weapons when disarmed.\nChanges in version 1.21 Added a new power build, the Claw of Malar.\n\n Updated the Iron Sorcerer to version 2 created by JeminiZero.\n\n Added journal entries listing the stats, feats, and skills of gladiators.\n\n Added Zalantar spears among the weapons that are available from the Arena Master.\n\n Added a new item to the Arena Master's list of available armor and clothing: the Swashbuckler's Tunic. This is an unenchanted piece of clothing that looks a lot better than monk pajamas.\n\n Fixed the spellcasting animations and spell ranges of the Blood Scholar.\n\n Made numerous improvements to the AI.\nFor details on the complete version history of the module, see the enclosed readme file.\n\n\nCredits for the Power Builders\nNone of the power builds in this module were created by me.

There are stores in Knights Landing that sell almost every level of weapon, magic and armor. The Temple sells healing potions and most clerical scrolls.

Censorship takes away from the \"reality of the fantasy\" (\"G rating\"). \n2. You always have to kill everybody (with few exceptions).\n3. You are always rushed through the early levels (because you're so weak).\n\n\nWith the above three items in mind, I created The Ritual, my first experience with the NWN2 toolset. \n\nMy primary goals for this module were: First and foremost, the Ritual was created so I could learn the toolset, and create a fun and unique single player game for my wife, kids and friends to enjoy� \n\nMy secondary goals were to incorporate a non-lethal fight routine, place \nmy original artwork in the NWN2 picture frames and begin the saga of Jon Barleycorn.\n\nUnlike many of the NWN2 modules where you create your own character, The Ritual is designed to play the pre-made character named: Jon Barleycorn.

Who says an empty cask of ale and pounding head don't make for a productive day?\n\nSands of Solvheil II: Beneath the Hearleforne picks up write where the previous module left off. You find yourself employed as a Royal Herald of the kingdom of Dalreon whose first assignment is investigating an anonymous street vigilante who operates beyond the law. Amid various events about town, you learn of mounting tension between the Crown and the new Temple of Tornne. King Jorlaan soon tells you that your services are needed in the massive forest that plays home to the indigenous elven race. After Harrn's defeat at the battle of Jerichon's Field, and the subsequent Surrender at Storneth, the dwarves who had lent them one of their religious icons have come to collect. Unfortunately for King Ulivon of Harrn, the brigade that carries the relic refuses to return and has taken refuge in the Great Forest. \n\nFearing instability in the region should the dwarves take to arms with Harrn, you are sent to locate the renegade warriors and recover the dwarven artifact to secure peace in the North. The Crown also hopes the inclusion of the elves in this assignment may help to alleviate ages of past tensions with them and expedite an official treaty. Get in, shake hands with the pointy ears, find the barbarians, recover the item, save the day, get out. Sounds like a piece of cake as long as nothing goes wrong.\n\nAlong the way you'll discover more about the intricacies of the material world, as well as the ramifications of the flood caused by the Imlan Sea being expelled from its mountain basin. You'll be asked to help atone for the past sins of humanity, and learn of the problems that arise when arcane and divine magic suddenly return to a world that had long forgotten them.\n\n\nModule Trilogy\nSands of Solvheil I: The Ruins of Kazatharis Link\nSands of Solvheil II: Beneath the Hearleforne Link\nSands of Solvheil III: Crusaders of Shalihir Link\n\n\nCharacter Creation \n\nRace:\nFor the scope of this module, it is assumed that the player is human.

Whoah, first of all, did you clear out your [Override] folder and have only the included files in there to play this? Yeah I know, picky picky, but we are tinkering under the hood here. A clean etch-a-sketch is all I ask to deliver the fewest possible hangups. Yeah, I'm allergic to haks and campaign folders.\n\nQ.) Conversations are flying by faster than I can blink!\nA.) If you don't have the Lip Flapper (Thanks Rogue Dao) Wav files in place, they are ignored and thus each conversation node has no placeholder to slow it down. Make sure these are in your Override folder, or take a speed-reading course.\n\nQ.) I'm rather broke for being a Royal Herald, don't you think?\nA.) Fine fine, in the next build, I will throw some more coin your way. In the meantime, use the DM Tome to throw yourself some. You did pick it up off of the desk in the beginning right?\n\nQ.) I can't see very well underwater.\nA.) The graphical limitation of the water in Sunken Temple is unfortunately unavoidible. This was to allow for the 2-tier level with both above and below water traversable sections. The known work around is utilizing your view to an over the shoulder look and somewhat zoomed in. While this isn't the ideal vantage for combat and exploration, I kept this area light on both for that very reason.\n\nQ.) Why can't I open the door to the Citadel in Storneth?\nA.) There seems to be a problem with the Snow Mulsantir Theater Placeable. You must use yor keyboard commands to step up to the door before you can open it with a mouse click. Just clicking on the door does not cause the controlled character to move close enough which causes many to think the door itself is stuck.\n\n\nCHANGELOG\n\nUpdate [v1.1]:\n-Fixed Names in Relic Restoration Journal Entry\n-Fixed spelling of Thief in Lockpocket conversation\n-Duplicate Ellenari Removed\n-for_wagon area renamed\n-Ellisvar conversation node fixed\n-Moved Storneth intro trigger back to prevent skipping of conversation\n[Workaround]\nUse DM Tome to set the quest [Relic Restoration] to Node [11] which enables King Ulivon to give you the proper conversation.\n[/Workaround]\n\nUpdate [v1.2]:\n-Put Start Location back in Albrynn Estate\n\nUpdate [v1.3]:\n-Moved Speaktrigger outside Cairn Caverns\n-Added/Adjusted some Conversations\n\nUpdate [v1.4]:\n-Replaced Override files with Hak Pak","Rating":8.44,"Votes":45,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"244":{"Name":"The Temple of Elemental Evil Revisited BETA","Author":"Kurt Piepenbrink (TheSpiderKing/Crichton)","Submitted":20080306,"Updated":20080307,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Classic PnP Conversion, Combat, Dungeon Adventure","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Large","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"08","Gameplay Length":"07","Patch":"1.11","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"This is the open beta for my ToEE conversion for NWN2.\n\nIt�s impossible to imagine the mod being produced without Troika�s The Temple of Elemental Evil.

Are you bold enough to attempt to escape?\n\nSmall module that should take approx 2 hours to finish. It is designed for a single level 5 (generally good or neutral, no really evil options) character of any build. XP is set to 10000 at start and should finish at level 6 (15000). All items are stripped at start as you are a slave.\n\nI play on hard core rules and puppetmode so I balanced for that. I recommend you download Tony K's AI and install it as I used this to test it and generally that hak makes all mods more enjoyable.\n\nSetting: In a forgotten realms 'like' world. That is there is no FR lore or references but the general FR feel is there (I think).\n\nSkills: All used somewhat, except no crafting skills.\n\nResting: Unrestricted. Its up to you to decide when to rest. Only rest when absolutely necessary for a challenge.\n\nWeapons: No exotic weapons other than bastard swords. Numerous custom weapons.\n\nCompanions: 2 forced. A gnome wizard and a human fighter.\n\nInstallation: Just put in user module directory. No haks though I recommend playing with Tony K AI installed.\n\nKnown Issues: Sometimes an image of your companions slave collar remains in the neck slot after removing it. Saving and reloading gets rid of it as does putting something else in that slot. Dont know why this happens.\n\nComments, criticism, praise welcome. This is my first module. I plan to make another at this stage which will follow on from this. Hope you enjoy.\n\n************************************\nversion v02\n\nHave made a few adjustments. thanks to smorpheus for some of these suggestions.\n*bug fixes, spelling, missing corners, journals etc\n*If you start the mod with a character greater than lvl 5 you will not get put down lvls. If you are lvl 5 or below xp is set to 10000. I recommend playing with lvl 5 char. Play with a lvl 6 if you want less challenge.\n*Player inventory is now stripped and placed in a chest in the final area. So you can retrieve any items that you did not want to loose. Just look around for it.\n*some fine tuning of battles. After playing through it again with a rogue I thought it was challenging but enjoyable. But I tweaked a little, Fenton & Gareth now have less HP. Breldon and Ellis arrows no longer damage as much. Hope I got it right, still you probably can't just go blindly rushing in expecting to win.\n*Changed Oggins starting spells to a combination I think works well in first main battle.\n*added a few small hints for vault. Don't want to make it too easy as there is quite a bit of loot in there.\n\n************************************\nv03\n*fixed broken transition when going back to lower mine then up again.\n\n***************************************\nv04\n*Hopefully fixed cutscene not firing sometimes for some people (but save before you click ladder just incase)\n*cleaned up some scripts and implemented a few skill checks properly\n*made it so that companions cannot be removed via GUI (may break game if this is done)\n*magda hammer quest will now update if a companion is being controlled when the hammer is found.\n*added additional clue for vault when talking to angus the slave.\n*Added the little book of thievery to adderis which gives another vault clue.\n*neutral enemies who turn hostile after dialogue cannot be killed now before dialogue is initiated.\n*added some minor dialogue to magda, and to oggins at end cutscene.\n*golem will now always attack once hostile.\n","Rating":8.38,"Votes":34,"Awards":[]},"278":{"Name":"Kethel","Author":"DerniaMelfar","Submitted":20080622,"Updated":20080622,"Category":"No Story (Ex: Resource, Level ups, etc.)","Module Types":"City Adventure, None / Freeform, Other","Scope":"Small","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Nonexistent","Hack & Slash":"Nonexistent","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"1","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"Kethel is a city in the making.

Now rumors abound of an old enemy threatening the dwarves once more. You, the Player find yourself willingly or reluctantly drawn into the unrest. \n\nThis is a story-driven, party-based adventure designed for a 5th level character of Good or Neutral alignment.\n\nThere are 4 companions, 3 available at the start: a cleric, rogue, and wizard. A fighter can join the party later in the module.\n\nYou can also make your own party from scratch. Access the Party Creation menu by talking to Mulligan the barkeep in the starting Village.\n\nYou can still bring along companions, but this will affect combat difficulty. I suggest going with a max party size of 5, using player created characters plus companions.\n\nLet me underscore, you do not have to play a dwarf for this adventure. In fact, the story probably works better for a non-dwarven race, an Outsider who finds him or herself caught up in the whirlwind of events. However, if you do play a dwarf, you will receive some greetings that are friendlier. (Well, friendly for dwarves.)\n\nThe module has some Party Chat style conversations, which will give dwarf characters an added opportunity to be heard.\n\nThe module uses the Storm of Zehir death system. There is no respawn. In addition, companions will start bleeding when they are reduced to negative hit points, and may die. You can use a Raise Dead scroll to bring them back.\n\nSave early, save often.\n\nResting is restricted to \"safe\" areas only. \n\nYou must start this module by selecting a New Campaign.\n\nThis module now uses the Robinson Workshop Deep Halls tileset. Download the Hak files and place them in your Neverwinter Nights2\\hak folder.\n\nThis module uses Rogue Dao's Lip Flappers. The sound files and .fxe files are in the compressed .rar file. You must copy these files to the Override folder, or else NPC conversations will go by too quickly.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS\n\nIn addition to Rogue Dao Studios for their Lip Flappers, Robinson Workshop for the Deep Halls tileset, and Lord Niah for his FR Base Mod that was previously used, I would like to express appreciation to the following members of the NWN2 community:\n\n*Phoenixus for giving the starting village a much needed face-lift with better texturing and height-mapping, and for testing the module. As well as for inviting me to the NW Citadel to help with the beta test.\n\n*Melirinda for testing the module and giving very helpful feedback, and most importantly, for convincing me to use Rogue Dao's Lip Flappers. Also, for your forum post that inspired the ogre dialogue on Halls Level 2. \n\n*JasonNH for initiating the bi-weekly updates in the NWN2 module forum, where builders can report on their progress. It was crucial in keeping me motivated and focused over the months of putting this module together. Also, I would like to thank everyone who posted in those forum updates, for your words of support, encouragement, and suggestions.\n\n*Being a veteran gamer and PnP player, I would like to dedicate this humble module to E. Gary Gygax, for creating the enchanting RPG hobby of Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nHarumph!\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nVersion History\n\nAugust 2, 2008: Hamhock v 1.01\n\n*Important NPCs that give/complete quests or initiate dialogue via speak triggers, will only converse with the PC. Ambient NPCs, random guards and such, can talk to party members if the Player selects the companions to do so.\n\n*Set multi-use speak triggers to destroy themselves when no longer needed. Also, repainted some speak triggers for better placement.\n\nAugust 3, 2008: Hamhock v 1.02\n\n*Bugbears are entrenched on the battlements of the Grand Entrance Hall, and they are very good at pushing back the advances of their opponent. This is why the dwarves have had trouble rooting them out of the corners. There is a chance during battle that your PC may be driven away from the enemy, and this quick fix adds a message that explains what is happening. Approach these encounters strategically. \n\n(THIS IS NO LONGER AN ISSUE)\n\nAugust 9, 2008: Hamhock v 1.03\n\n*Some cosmetic changes: Added Mulsantir Walls to the Hall of Gathering; added some more placeables to the Mayor's Estate; added more corpses around the Grand Entrance Hall.\n\nAugust 17, 2008: Hamhock v 1.04\n\n*Cleaned up some journal entries.\n*A dwarf soldier runs up to greet the party when they first arrive on the Mines level.\n*Beefed up the final encounter a little.\n*There is a secret way to avoid battle with the Undead Dwarven Veteran, which is alluded to in the Mines Walkthrough.\n\nAugust 31, 2008: Hamhock v 1.05\n\n*Companions now have XP independent of the PC. They start as 5th level characters, no matter what level you bring in your PC.\n*Fixed a couple of cameras; expanded Thraigin's \"rah-rah\" pep rally speech.\n\nSeptember 21, 2008: Hamhock v 1.06\n\n*Made some of the monsters tougher on Level 2.\n*Added the possibility of skill checks before the encounter triggers, which will warn players about the respawning bugbears.\n\nDecember 13, 2008: Hamhock v 1.07\n\n*Converted to Campaign format\n*Rebuilt levels using the Deep Halls tileset\n*Streamlined the Mines, getting rid of extraneous passages and areas\n*Incorporated Storm of Zehir features such as some Party Conversations and the bleeding/death system\n*Added full party customization as an option\n\nDecember 28, 2008: Hamhock v 1.08\n\n*Fixed the door to the Miners Quarters on level 1. This happened because I unknowingly swapped out a tile when I redesigned the Mines. Now you will be able to access the door that will transition you to a small area where it is safe to rest.\n\nFebruary 12, 2011: Hamhock v. 1.09\n\n*Changed almost all conversations to SoZ style \"Party Chat\" conversations. Tweaked a few lines of dialogue.\n","Rating":7.74,"Votes":27,"Awards":[]},"292":{"Name":"The Temple of Elemental Evil Revisited 1.01","Author":"Kurt/Crichton/TheSpiderKing","Submitted":20080729,"Updated":20080807,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Classic PnP Conversion, Dungeon Adventure, Temple / Crypt Adventure","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"08","Max Character Level":"08","Gameplay Length":"07","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Version 1.01 is now uploaded\n\nv 1.01 changelog:\n-The Hag in the troll fens now drops her eye on death.\n-Fixed dialog bugs with Rufus and Canoness Y�dey convos.\n-Either method of completing �Spies among us� now correctly mark the quest as completed.\n\nThe Temple of Elemental Evil Revisited is my own take on Gygax's classic pen and paper module.\n It�s impossible to imagine the mod being produced without Troika�s The Temple of Elemental Evil. There aren�t many games were I was so bitterly divided between the things I liked about the game and the things I disliked. As much as I enjoyed the combat system, I found the actual encounters simplistic and repetitive and as much as I liked the idea of a huge, balkanized pentagon-sized fortress filled with bugbears, the lack of storytelling left me cold. The Temple of Elemental Evil Revisited is my own little attempt to create a game with the basic ToEE set-up that a) gives the player choices about how he/she wants to deal with the temple, b) has an enjoyable story without railroading the player into it and c) has gameplay that people enjoy.\n There are a lot of different elements that I had to weigh to try to make all of this happen, but I�m pleased with the final result. The three basic principles that I tried to keep in mind in design were to keep try to design encounters that would take advantage of the ruleset, to allow choices about the progression of the plot and to make the player feel involved in the story of the temple, both in terms of exposition and background and in terms of some connection to the PC.\n There are also a number of things that I�ve changed from the original module (and by extension from Troika�s very faithful remake), some of these are minor (It�s set in Forgotten Realms, not Greyhawk, the geography of the temple has changed), some aren�t (Lareth and Lolth�) and I�m certain that many loyal fans aren�t going to like the changes (particularly since Gary Gygax died yesterday, I�m writing this on 3/5/08). To those people, I�d just like to say that I understand. Please give the module a try anyway; you might find something you like. \n","Rating":5.38,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"293":{"Name":"Traveller","Author":"human_male","Submitted":20080730,"Updated":20120728,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"06","Max Character Level":"09","Gameplay Length":"12","Categories":"Quest based, story driven adventure.

If you do, the frame rate should go back to normal while the game is paused. So pause to issue orders and set a destination ect, then unpause it again and so on. But I would recommend you try using Tony K's AI mod. I've tested it and the area in question runs much better. Link. BUT the mod causes enemies to behave in ways I didn't intend when I placed them, in particular you may find it very difficult to defeat the guards in Harcourt manor. If you have trouble try disabling the AI mod until you've got through that bit. I know it's awkward and I'm sorry about that. That is the only bit that is a problem though.\n\nIn addition there's a bug that's caused by the toolset corrupting one of the areas (the mountain area), so I can't change or fix anything there (for example the load screen). There is a corpse associated with the Dragon Hunter's quest near the mountain fort which can easily be destroyed by area effect spells. If that happens you can't complete the quest. I'm sorry about that. \n\nAs always feedback and bug reports appreciated.\n\nIf you have any trouble, please feel free to email me at aww_bummer@yahoo.co.nz\nSeriously, feel free. I'm starved for human contact.\n----------------------------------------\n\nYour wanderings bring you to the manor of the honourable Lord Harcourt, north of Waterdeep. You have spent many weeks on the open road and need a rest. Luckily the manor is in need of a captain of the guard and you are offered the position. You decide to accept and stay for a time. Your lodgings are comfortable and your duties non too strenuous.\n\nA bonus, or a problem whichever way you choose to look at it, is that the fetching Lady Delphine, Lord Harcourt's daughter seems to have taken a shine to you. \n\nLet's hope you have the sense not to do anything foolish where the lady is concerned while you are here.\n\nThough she is extremely fetching.\n\nGAME NOTES: \n\nNot recommended for younger gamers due to grownup content.\n\nRequires both Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir.\n\nSign posts act as area transitions.\n\nParty chat box used for aesthetic purposes only.\n\nThe dungeons are dark. Really dark. You'll finally have a use for your Dark Vision and all those torches and light spells that are totally useless in the commercial games. \n\nSingle player, recommended for levels 6-10. It's intended to be very challenging for the equivalent of a sixth level fighter, starting with moderate level gear (on hardcore D&D rules) with the rogue companion (you're going to need a rogue). Since it's sort of a sequel to my previous mod, The Corruption of Kiahoro, I balanced it for the character that I used for that module, with the rogue accompanying them. There are four companions that can join you permanently, and one that will join you temporarily. If you take all companions you will likely find it too easy. It's up to you to decide what level to play at based on your class and how tough you like it. For weaker classes likes bards and rogues I suggest playing at level 8 or 9 or taking all four companions with you. There should also be enough loot to buy all the potions you need for buffing. If you find the battles are too hard a few buffing potions can make all the difference. If you find it too easy don't take as many companions with you. Use your companions and potions to adjust the difficulty to your liking. If you're simply finding it way too hard then play at a higher level.\n\nIt's fine if you start the mod with your own gear, as long as you have stuff that's appropriate to your level and won't unbalance the game. If you have a lot of high end stuff you're likely to find it rather boring because most of the loot is low to medium level (mostly +1 with a few +2 items).\n \nI tried hard to balance the loot and gold that's available. I didn't want this mod to make you rich and overpowered with high end stuff. All of the merchants have a limited amount of gold on them and they may not have enough to buy all your loot (although it's not as severe as my previous mod).\n\nThis module is a low magic environment, but I hope it's still playable and enjoyable for magic using players. There's a character who sells basic magic supplies so hopefully you will find what you need.\n\nBUGS: I've noticed a couple of bugs that I have no idea how to fix. Sometimes the rogue companion fails to recover her own traps. Sometimes transferring items from one character's inventory to another's by dragging and dropping doesn't work. The journal sometimes doesn't work properly for companions so make sure you're in control of your own character when you check your journal. If NPCs who are former companions continue to follow you despite no longer being in the party just talk to them once and they should stop. \n\nOne more thing you should be aware of is the script that strips your items at the beginning deletes containers (such as Bag of Holding). Nothing I can do about that, sorry. You will however get all your other stuff back, so don't freak out.\n\nThanks to falloutboy, Berliad, Brendan Bellina and many folks on the Bioware NWN2 forum for the use of their scripts, and Aleanne for the female clothing pack.\n\nSpecail thanks to all the people who contributed to the beta testing process, especailly Tauschitz, masuli, ThosRTanner, Alabore, resistorman, eb52t, sirchet and Eric Doman (sorry if I forgot anyone). It was an enormous help.\n\nHuman_male (chaotic good commoner), 2008, Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nHuzaah!\n","Rating":9.28,"Votes":117,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"294":{"Name":"BotD map 04","Author":"Nixyss","Submitted":20080730,"Updated":20080806,"Category":"Multiplayer (10+ Players)","Module Types":"Combat, PvP","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Dependant on Module","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"04","Max Character Level":"30","Gameplay Length":"03","Categories":"tactical team pvp \nnwn2 rules \nno hak, no overrides, no guis, no tlks, no 2das, everything is standard.","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"BotD development team. \nBotD was created by Zorque in 2004.

If you haven't played it then take a look, its short and will introduce the characters for this module. If not then no bother, you can play still play this.\n\nAfter escaping from Lord Treldorn's Mine you travel to Oggin's village. You soon discover that Treldorn has the village surrounded.

Copy the LetoScript.dll file into your NWN2 install directory,copy xp_leto.dll into your NWNX4 directory.

This should be really straight forward, copy the hak file dragonkin_v1-11 into your servers hak directory. Copy the zith_appearance_test.mod into your module directory. \n\n2.)

I can't level up Aleandra, it crashes when I try!\n\nA: You need to update your game to 1.13 or later.\n\nQ: When Aleandra joins my party, she is a warlock. That doesn't seem right.\n\nA: It's not. You either didn't install the mod correctly, removed the packages.2da from the override, or have another packages.2da in the override conflicting with it. Make sure it's the only one in there and try again. She should be a cleric.\n\nQ: I'm trying to get into House Scipi's basement, but the fog of war doesn't disappear.\n\nA: Use WASD movement to get in there. It's some kind of weird engine bug where when you open that door the fog of war doesn't disappear from the room. Just walking in will make it disappear, but since you can't click that area you need to use keyboard movement. I can't fix that.\n\nQ: I'm on the Botuf the Black quest chain, and I can't find the elven tribune...\n\nA: There's only two \"elven\" buildings in the city, and it's in the basement of one of them. It's a little difficult to access so you'll have to find a way.\n\nQ: I don't know who my patron house is after the banquet.\n\nA: It's in your journal. \n\nHouse Scipi - located in the noble district, he's upstairs in the bedroom.\nHouse Danworth - located in the noble distrct, he's in a room to the left of the front door at the head of the table.\nHouse Scipi - located in the Market. He's standing near a fireplace on the first floor.\nHouse Halvasyn - located in the Noble district. She's right in front of you when you enter.\nThe Apprentices - located in the Palace in the throne room, the woman in purple.\nThe Palace - located in the Palace, the guy sitting on the throne.\n\nQ: Help, I'm lost and don't know what to do next...\n\nA: It's very important you pay attention to what's going as you play. A lot of things happen and aren't repeated or referenced again, and sometimes you need to take into consideration what you do know and figure things out on your own.

NOW ALSO SUPPORTS SOZ!!) \n=================================== \nHave you finished Mask of the Betrayer or Storm of Zehir? Do you have a few epic characters ready for some more D&D adventuring? Well, perhaps this will be a module to your liking. In Trial & Terror you can pit your NWN2 ability against a large and bewildering dungeon fraught with peril. \n\nA certain Supreme Priest Sukumvit has invited you to his cult up in the Godswatch Mountains (Teyla Shan). This mountain range is located in a far-east part of Faerûn, near Kara Tur, on the southern border of the huge Plain of Horses. Sukumvit�s cult worships an anonymous God of Terror. In honour of this new god, a former temple of Etugen has been converted and expanded deep inside the heart of Teyla Shan. Curiously, the entire temple also doubles as the very site of the cult's sacred challenge � the Trial of Terror. In legacy of his father � Baron Sukumvit, an infamous deathtrap dungeon master � the supreme priest presents you with a subterranean ordeal that no hero has survived so far. The reward is the soaring amount of 1,000,000 gp. As soon as you agree to the challenge, you will undergo a trance ritual, which will prepare you for your entrance through the Gate of No Return.\n\nNota bene:\nPlayers, be warned! This is my first module ever. Moreover, before this module, I have had zero experience of scripting. Nonetheless, Trial & Terror is littered with scripts. Any of those scripts malfunctioning is nothing short of my fault.\n\n====================================== \n \nINSTALLATION:\nAs per version 101608, you will need to download and unzip the following 7z-files:\n-trialandterrorXXXXXX.7z\n-trialandterrorhak.7z\n-trialandterrormusic.7z\n\nMind you, if you wish to use Kaedrin's PrC pack, then you should donwload another hak instead, plus the file with the appropriate 2das. Further instructions on how to install and use his pack comes with the 2da 7z-download (which is version specific):\n-trialandterrorhak_KaedrinPCP.7z\n-trialandterror2das_KaedrinXXX.7z\n\nIn order to install Trial & Terror correctly, you need the �trialandterror.mod� (put in modules directory), �trialandterror.hak� (put in hak directory - or the Kaedrin version, if you are using that one) and then drop the �music files� into your Music directory. Also, you'll need a tlk-file - trialandterror_custom.tlk (put in NWN2/docs tlk dir). If you happen to have files in your Override directory, such as 2da-files, this will corrupt this module, unless it is Kaedrin's of course, provided you have followed the instructions properly.\n\nSOZ OWNERS - INSTALLING\nThe 'trialandterrorXXXXXX.7z' 7z-file contains five items. First, the mod file - 'trialandterror.mod' (put in NWN2/docs module dir, just as non-SoZ owner do). Then there is a campaign directory - 'Trial and Terror Campaign' (put in NWN2/docs campaign dir), a tlk-file - trialandterror_custom.tlk (put in NWN2/docs tlk dir).\n\nRemember to start the game as a 'New Campaign'!\n\n***\nAs per patch 1.22, a same-named tlk-file with no .tlk extension is no longer necessary to make the load screens work. It had to be put in NWN2/Atari dir, where Obsidian's own dialog.tlk is). If you still need one of these, you can easily create own out of the ordinary .TLK file (just remove the .tlk-extension or extract one from my patch 1.13 mod 7z-file.\n***\n\n\nPREPARING YOUR PLAYER CHARACTER AND STARTING THE GAME: \nYou will start the game in an area that functions as a so-called �lobby�. This Horde Oasis area is populated by various caravan traders, which have more or less everything you will need. If you talk to Mr Soulmolder, he can help you level up and get some gold, if necessary. Although I personally do not always appreciate the features just below, I decided early on to include them in Trial & Terror (mostly because MotB is designed this way):\n- Free resting (except one small and special area).\n- Over-generous amounts of loot � from helpful potions and an up-and-running crafting system to extremely powerful items and smashingly lavish valuables.\n\nEven if you create your own party, remember that T&T still revolves around your main character! \n \n============================= \n\nTrial & Terror offers \n\n- An adventure loosely inspired by a flip-a-lot novel called Deathtrap Dungeon, by Ian Livingstone.\n- A multi-directional module that is action-packed while still offering quite some depth for those players who are interested. In fact, the module has been designed so that a so-called hack-n-slash player can make good progress. Should that player opt to be an evil character, challenging melee will abound, rest assured! Still, it must be underlined that Trial & Terror strongly encourages and rewards the curious, role-playing player, who cannot help picking fitting conversation responses or rightclicking on objects of all kind. Actually, plenty of items, encounters and even entire areas will only be accessible for the talkative and the nosy!\n- Replayability\n- Depending on the player�s choices of routes inside this huge maze, his or her behaviour when facing friends and foes, his or her alignment, and also his or her character-specific skills and feats, there will be several ways to exit the Trial of Terror successfully. Similarly, there will be different endings.\n- Estimated 9-12 hours of gameplay (although there is a special route ending it in less than 1 h).\n- Over 100,000 words of dialogue and environmental interaction.\n- 10 soundtracks new to the NWN2 game\n- Lots of varied monsters and varied difficulty (I want to keep the players on their toes).\n- Some opponents will require the use of tactical combat.\n- Death requires a reload from a saved game.\n- Forgotten Realms lore - some creative liberties have been taken, but the core is canon. The Horde modules have been used extensively as well as other resources. I realise that some of my knowledge may be outdated, since I was primarily active as a PnP player and DM when the 2nd ed was available.\n- If you make a special series of choices, some degree of planar travel will take place.\n- An attempt at basic multiplayer support (I have tried to script the module so that it allows mp �\n this has not been tested fully).\n\nTrial and Terror also offers, to all those owning SoZ (and thus having installed the T&T campaign dir and custom tlk files):\n- A new 'unconsciousness' death system\n- Create your own party of four (just use Mr Soulmolder's 'Soul Percolator' and create your own party of kindred souls. You can even swap party members in the Hall of Second Thoughts!\n- About 50 loadscreen tips unique to Trial and Terror.\n\n======================================= \nA few tips and tricks good to know before playing Trial & Terror \n\n- Since death requires a reload, saving is your friend. Many encounters can easily floor the best of characters, so save frequently.\n- Ensure that your precious character is armed to the teeth. You will need all power and protection you can get! It is possible that poorly equipped level 30 characters will not stand a chance against a few mean fiends! All play testing has been done using the normal difficulty setting. Cranking up that slider to hardcore will probably transform Trial & Terror to something awfully cruel.\n- If you only own MotB, this module will not have any companions joining you, not even self-made ones. However, there will be a few occasions where so-called henchmen come to your aid.\n- Although playing this module solo is supposed to be a challenge even for a level 30 character with top gear, do not let this circumstance stop the challenge monger within you! Please, feel free to chicken race against yourself. See how low level a character you can have surviving Trial & Terror. Once, I did pass through it using a level 21 character, so everything is possible!\n- Bear this in mind: A multiplayer session (should such a thing work with new SoZ add-ons), just like using a full self-created party, will lessen the module�s challenge level depending on the size of the party. I would estimate that a party of four level-21 characters would do fine, if properly equipped.\n- Trial & Terror is an epic module with epic beings. Don�t be surprised if killing some creatures� physical manifestations is not the same as permanently eradicating them! There are several examples in the module where entities will keep returning, seemingly unharmed. In fact, a few cases of such respawning are pivotal for the direction various plots will take.\n- The main quest is no doubt to survive inside the trial of terror long enough to be able to find the exit. However, there are plenty of subquests that directly affect the outcome of the main quest.\n- The module has been deliberately designed as a �killer dungeon�. The dungeon is therefore tough, very large and many things are �hidden� at first, meaning that you as a player must test and touch as much stuff as you can, if you wish to see this module in full bloom. However, such a trial-and-error approach is at times deadly as well.\n- There is one bottle neck in this module and that is the exit out of the trial dungeon. It can only be opened by finding the right keys, as it were. Mileage will vary as far as how quickly and reliably different players collect these �keys�. So do not despair, if you do not immediately acquire the key-like objects! As a matter of fact, I have included two of each, so the prospect of your exiting Trial & Terror is rather good, if you just show some patience.\n- Trial & Terror entails a massive dungeon. This means that your character�s exploration may soon turn into long stretches of underground trudging. In order to counter that, the module contains alternative ways of transportation, often quicker and able to criss-cross the more obvious routes. Most of these alternatives are easy to find and use.\n- A few races will get quite a different module. I won�t tell you which ones. What I can tell you is that subterranean races will obviously feel less of a strain from being locked up inside a mountain.\n- If you play with a SoZ-style party, just ensure that you keep the companions on a tight leash! Use their behaviour tabs to set their AI in a way which make them not run off too far on their own. Such heroic bursts of insanity will more often than not lead to certain death!\n- It is a good idea for non-cleric characters to bring raise dead/resurrection scrolls or coins of life. This is especially good to have around if party clerics lie before you dead on some dirty dungeon floor!\n- Let druids beware! There are plenty of areas which appear to be natural but in fact are not.\n\n\n======================================= \n\nTHANK YOU\nThis module would not exist if it wasn�t for the NWN2 forum over at Bioware�s. That community includes so many kind and helpful souls. I cannot thank them all. But I can thank a lot of them:\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n- SunJammer (you have clarified the basics of nwn2-scripting to me, over and over. Plus that I have implemented several of your nice conversation scripts.)\n- Elysius (several key scripts owe their existence to you. Some boss AI is taking full use of some of your solutions in your earliest versions of BotB.)\n- ciViLiZed (just for your huge patience! You have ran to me rescue on countless occasions!)\n- Raelius Archmannon (you have solved a few tricky scripts like no other!)\n\nAlso a big thanks to:\n- Wyrin_D�njargo\n- Dirtywick\n- Melirinda\n- Shaughn78\n- Shadowbeast\n- Nihlar\n- Grinning Fool\n- Phoenixus\n- Merecraft\n- Kaldor Silverwand\n- Eguintir Eligard\n- Dunniteowl\n- Diophant\n- Baragg\n- Jassper\n- Azenn\n- Gallaen Frost\n- Night Stalker\n- Countless\n- Mithdradates\n- Nostrilhair\n- Loudent2\n- Julia M\n- Corey79\n- CID 78\n- Abraxas77\n- Tension69\n- Orion1966\n- Wylonus\n- Taball\n\n \nI owe heaps of thanks to the following guys and their great modules / prefab areas. They have saved me lots of time and given me great �skeletons� to flesh out:\n- Blackstone Keep 2 � Driller (how generous! Btw, BSK NWN1 was a great pw!)\n- Malese Kish � Moloch (how generous 2!)\n- Temple of Evil � Lady Lilia / Shimmer\n- Fort Vibia - TheNine\n- Warehouse - Wyrin_D�njargo\n- Vordan�s hero creator (the first module I ever downloaded, and the first scripts I ever saw. So, the first area in my mod is inspired by one of those areas.)\n- House of Joys - Conall Halfbearded\n\nHalf of the music in this mod has been taken from NWN2 OC + MotB. The other half has been made by two composers:\n- Inon Zur (Icewind Dale 2)\n- Derek R Audette (C) MMIV-MMVI:\n-�The Lonesome Death of Jonas Grumby�\n-�Ginger Grant�\n-�Combustible Coffee Pot�\n-�Quantum Entanglement�\n-�Cerebral Vortex�\n-�A Big Hard World�\n-�Toxic Shock�\n-�Timestream Station�\n-�Shunned�\n-�Blueberry Compote�\n\nFinally, a sincere thanks to all custom-content artists: \n- Robinson Workshop � nearly all their great tilsesets are included in this module! \n- Yaddaman - Robots \n- Jonny Ree - Beholder \n- Schazzwozzer � Clay golem\n- Arsan � Arsan Hood\n- ArPharazon - NoMap\n- Jester-v01 � Jester�s gear\n- SDJ � Oriental 3D Models Pack\n- Naisou � Japanese placeables\n- BlueNude � BlueFemaleNudes\n- Escriminator - handaxes\n- Seryn � 20 new NWN2 potions\n- Cyric the Dark - Banner headdress\n- Lucky Devita - Heucuva\n\nKnown issues\n- Most areas use a great number of point lights. Unless you have an older machine, please ensure that you have enabled such lights in your NWN2 options panel. The game will look much better that way!\n- A few areas are dark (a deliberate design choice). Turn on the �night-vision� button, if you play with a character that has such a racial ability.\n- I apologise for the poor quality of the VO in this module! It is corny, cheesy, Darth-in-a-helmet metallic and often sad acting (except for two remixed surprises). The volume is also inconsistent. I have still decided to keep most of it, as I believe it makes Trial & Terror more entertaining. It is a good laugh, if nothing else.\n- English is not my first language, so the module is bound to include a few errors funny to native speakers. Let us pretend that those grammatical flaws are part of the entertainment value, shall we?\n- Lots of dialogue have been written in a rather special spirit, almost like those bombastic word exchanges used in the strips of Marvel Comics. I just love cumbersome words, I cannot help it!\n- If you run around using non-main characters as leaders in the front while playing a SoZ-style party, you may miss out on some narrative convos, including some VO, and also cutscene convos set up with cameras.\n- Remember, the first character you load into T&T is your leader and thus your main character. The leader will have more chores to do than the rest. The leader is treated as the true trial champion among you!\n- Also, all the new SoZ Party Chat convo windows that was part of T&T (vs 11 Dec & 12 Dec) are unfortunately abortable via the Escape button. From vs 15 Dec this is no longer an issue.\n\nThank you for playing and please post feedback! \n\nRELEASE NOTES \n============= \n-v101008 - First Release. Please, regard this as a beta release.\n-v101308 - made a few convo triggers surefire, fixed some typos and a VO bug, tweaked a few cams at the end.\n-v101608 - The 7z is now just the mod file! The main quest journal is fixed at the end, same with a few map pins. The mod is now adjusted for Kaedrin's Prc pack, thanks to Shaughn78!\n-v101808 - A journal update bug in Mrs S's convo fixed. Sotur convo has been updated so that certain responses does not lead to fall out. Vampire coffins convo was corrupt, but is now replaced and healthy. A decrease of golem archers in a certain area has been done + a tweaking of their script.\n-v102308 - on popular demand, the background tune of the Caverns of the Conquerors have been changed, Mordan's speak trigger have been tweaked, certain death lords as well as archer golems have been made slightly weaker. Lastly, a number of typos have been corrected - thanks for finding them, SB\n-v110108 - the seneschal convo has been corrected, enabling a quest branch.\n-v110608 - ATTENTION - Trial & Terror is from now on updated to patch 1.13. The heart cobbles are now easier to find and non-destroyable. A magical kukri cannot be crushed. Mrs S's portal convo has been corrected. A few typos have been taken care of. The No Map of a certain maze is now covering.\n-v110708 - A number of items that can be picked up from 'floors' have been made to work properly, script-wise.\nATTENTION - from 112308 - the v110708 module version should be patch 1.21 compatible. The trialandterror.hak has been changed so that Trial & Terror hopefully can accommodate even the Storm of Zehir expansion owners. This has not been tested yet - also beware of known early bugs in that expansion, which affects area transition speak triggers as well as voiceovers! Further, the Kaedrin 2da-files have now been updated to fit his Storm of Zehir and patch 1.21-compatible version 1.34.1a. The earlier one, 1.33.3, had a few minor errors within them. I am sorry for that. These have been corrected.\n-v112808 - This update addresses the speak trigger issues that are caused by the Storm of Zehir expansion - these were not game breaking, but made players miss out on lots of VO and some side quest details. The triggers should be working fine now, unless you have rolled up, say, a gray orc doomguide. For some reason, new races/classes in SoZ still have problems with some speak triggers in T&T, such as the phylactery ones. This update has also ensured that BlueNudes 'naked clothing' does not replace NWN2's original set. Further, certain dwarven graves now have better working spawn triggers - the same graves have been revamped as well - containing much more items. Lastly, a few typos have been corrected.\n-v120608 - This is really Trial and Terror 1.1! It has been turned into a campaign, while still being playable as a stand-alone module. The campaign version is available to SoZ owners only! Now you can create your own party and smash T&T into smithereens! 50 loadscreen tips. The SoZ death system. The only real issue with SoZ self-made parties in this mod is that your main char is the only one able to converse with NPCs and placeables, so far, except for lobby area. Other fixes: The Caverns of the Conquerors have been revamped. The dwarven graves crashing at spawning is finally a squashed bug. Some archer guards are less twitchy now. Mrs S goes more properly hostile now, same with a strange dragon. An invisible spider is now visible. A few typos and faulty walkmesh cutters have been corrected. More items have been added.\n-v121108 - A large number of SoZ Party Chat convos have been added for those playing Trial & Terror as a SoZ compatible campaign. About 3000 words worth of dialogue has been added! Several new skill checks have been added. In this way, T&T will flow much more smoothly while playing it with a full party! A few more typos have been corrected. A bug where friendly Imaskari 'wizards' got spawned, instead of hostile ones, have been fixed. A new attempt to fix the archer guard bug at Mr O has been done.\n-v121208 - HOTFIX!!! For the first time, a game-breaking bug happened to slip through (in v 121108)! Instead of a central gate giving you a gate convo, you got a rathole convo instead! This bug has been fixed in this essential version! Replacing the old trialandterror.mod file with the one included here should make your old 121108-saves work. Another bug fix is a certain skeleton that refused to react upon a certain theft sometimes. Lastly, some safeguarding scripting and journal updating have been added to a few important area-enter convos.\n-v121508 - All SoZ party chat convos are now non-abortable! If your party leader is at the front, you will now get more camera cutscene value out of T&T. The starting convo upon entering the pronaos is now much more reliable. The same goes for the starting convo of the Imaskari Hideout. A certain panel in the Rinsing Room won't leave SoZ party chat convo if certain globes are not found (just leave convo and restart it with a new char, if this issue remains). A darkness-comment barkstring in Imaskari Hideout will now only run once. Two typos in the loadscreens have been corrected. Zhordash's deathscript has been improved as far as quest updates go. At the end of the game, two new versions have been added, much because they were logically missing (they lack one line each of VO though).\n-v010709 - SoZ seems to have affected a script that counted the number of rings you had collected from certain frost giant baddies. Hence, this mod version has updated the dwarven phantom's convo to check for the rings themselves instead, and not an int variable. Also, the install instruction text has been corrected.\nv010809 - Due to a SoZ party script glitch in the troll idol convo, when used, it caused the game to freeze up sometimes. That convo is now fixed.\nv021009 - A number of fixes. The spawn scripts in the Dwarven Prehistoric Caves and in the Precipice of Innocence should be crash-safe(r) now. A few dialogue options have been added to Z's convo, all of which are meant to enrage her! The epilogue convo has been corrected so that it accommodates the crushing of Mr O's avatar heart. There are no longer mysterious longbows and rapiers lying around in the Caverns of Conquerors. Dream weapons should now be working in accordance with MotB (it will require you to have the T&T campaign dir in place).\nv030309 - This is a patch 1.22-updated version of the mod 7z-file. As per this update, a custom tlk file with no .TLK extension is no longer needed. The 'trialandterror_custom.tlk' will suffice. Also, if a pc takes the scroll from the seated skeleton, that pc will now get his or her hands on it!","Rating":9.48,"Votes":55,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"319":{"Name":"Conan Chronicles 1 - The Barbarian Chronicles","Author":"John McA","Submitted":20081015,"Updated":20130429,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Combat, Dramatic, Dungeon Adventure, Final Version, Mountain Adventure, Snowy Adventure, Temple / Crypt Adventure","Scope":"Large","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"NA","Roleplay":"NA","Hack & Slash":"NA","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"01","Gameplay Length":"20","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"v1.5 Tested for Kaedrin Expansion Compatibility\n\n\"Know, O Prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an Age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars.\" - The Nemedian Chronicles.\n\nSuch half-legendary fragments are all that remain to tell of the Hyborian Age and its greatest hero, Conan.\n\nThis Campaign combines and updates the three individual Conan modules I uploaded earlier. There are many bug-fixes and enhancements, including a full Hyborian world range of items and fully custom Character creation, including custom races and deities.\n\nYou can play the Campaign as Conan, or as a hero of your own design, following your career from its beginning as a youth among the barbarian Aesir, to your eventual rise to claim the throne of Aquilonia, the most powerful Hyborian kingdom.\n\n\"Legions of the Dead\", the first adventure in the \"Conan Chronicles 1 - The Barbarian Chronicles\" campaign, describes the first recorded exploits of the young Conan, when as a youth of sixteen summers he fled his home in Cimmeria to join with a band of Northern barbarians in the frigid land of Asgard.

This former cleric stronghold developed into a small outpost of society in a harsh environment, but sometimes, the most sinister and dangerous adventures occur within those walls, not beyond them.\n\nYou are a member of the City Watch by circumstance, and ever since you arrived Darthall has appeared a place where intrigue lies just beneath the surface. Yet those tensions stand ready to burst forth at any moment, and the faint rumours of trouble stirring on the city's outskirts may prove even troublesome, for word has reached Darthall of an army marching forth on its gates even now...\n\nWill you seek power, fame, glory or riches? Choose your enemies carefully, and your friends even more wisely, for danger and betrayal might lurk around any corner as you shape the Fate of a City.\n\n-----\n\nFate of a City is a story-driven module with plenty of roleplaying and action.

We had always talked about doing a mod, but never got around to it. This mod is a fulfillment of sorts of that shared dream. The details are in the �players guide� pdf that accompanies the mod. Today is Jon�s birthday, so I thought it appropriate as a release date,\nThe mod is based on a short story by my son Jonathan. There is much of him in this mod - and more than a little of me. Changes have been made to the story to make it work as a game and as it began to take shape, I became aware that some of Jon�s real story - in particular our relationship - was also finding its way into the plot. SYNOPSIS: (no spoilers) - The PC is currently looking for work in Fenhollow, a small settlement on the edge of the waste lands. He has been away from his clan for 10 years following a falling out with his father. It is the time of the Maerond - a \"fight to the death\" competition sponsored by a mysterious group of guardians known as the Dwarinth. Many would-be champions have arrived in town, and seem intent on eliminating as much of the competition as possible prior to the actual event.\n\nFAIR WARNING: This module is very story driven, and low on the level of role-play. I don�t want to mislead folks � my purpose was to tell the story � though truth be told, even that has changed considerably from Jon�s original. The module assumes that you have a newly created character - with only the clothes on your back. Everything you need can be found in the module. I have decided not to strip and level characters (I hate when mods do that to me). You can play with any level race, class, weaponry etc. However, the story was written from the perspective of a male fighter - I have been playing a barbarian � that�s the closest to what Jon wrote - and makes the most sense when playing from that perspective.\n\nInstallation is pretty straight forward � but full details are in the �install/play �pdf file � just open it and follow the instructions.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to the many folks who have offered support and encouragement. This is my first attempt at anything like this � and I couldn�t have arrived at this point without your help � both direct and indirect (things gleaned on the community forums). When I firth started visiting the discussions I wondered why the group was referred to as �the community�.

The gripping storyline foreshadows the events that will take place in the Forgotten Realms with the coming of release this June of the Fourth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons® Roleplaying Game.\n\nIn the aftermath of the defeat of the King of Shadows, the Sword Coast is in the midst of an uneasy economic recovery. Trade syndicates have sprung up to exploit the post-war confusion for their own ends. The players� party will wade into this uncertain environment; in order to increase their own fortunes, they can either ally with a syndicate to create a trade empire, or cut their own path through Faerûn by preying upon caravans and selling the goods on the black market. As they attempt to extend their influence, players will become aware of a new faction working behind the scenes: the evil, shapeshifting, serpentine Yuan-Ti.\n\nIn addition to trading and economic manipulation, the Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir Overland Map allows players to explore the Chultan Peninsula and Sword Coast in a non-linear manner never before seen in any of the Neverwinter Nights games. Exploration will take players from well-known locations, like Neverwinter and Crossroad Keep, to more exotic areas, such as the xenophobic jungle nation of Samarach. Groups of highwaymen and monsters populate the Overland Map and the farther from civilization the player roams, the more difficult the encounters become. The 15-hour campaign in Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir is also packed with new classes, spells, creatures, and playable races.\n\nFans of the compelling multiplayer features of Neverwinter Nights 2 will also be able to take advantage of new improvements to the multiplayer experience, while modders will be able to take advantage of the power and flexibility of the Overland Map and Trading System features along with other world-building enhancements.\n\n* Game Features -\n# Travel the Sword Coast and Samarach using the open ended exploration of the new Overland Map. Use skills like Spot and Survival while on the Overland Map to avoid ambushes and even find hidden locales and lost artifacts.\n# Create your own full party of adventurers. Devastate your foes with a squad of fireball-flinging Sorcerers, form a solid wall of steel with a party of Fighters, or strike the perfect balance in your party by spreading out the classes you choose for your characters.\n# Improved party gameplay including streamlined party conversations, a new Teamwork Benefit System, and powerful party feats.\n# The world's economy reacts to your adventures and choices. And, through trading and quests, you can expand your merchant company into a massive trading empire.\n# Updated classic features: New classes (including prestige classes), spells, creatures, and playable races.","Rating":6.76,"Votes":77,"Awards":["ReviewersAward.jpg"]},"335":{"Name":"An Unwelcome Winter Guest SOZ v1.03","Author":"MikeLM9215","Submitted":20081224,"Updated":20081228,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Module Types":"Snowy Adventure","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Small","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Light","Min Character Level":"04","Max Character Level":"08","Gameplay Length":"01","Categories":"Forgotten Realms\nIcewind Dale\nLonelywood","Patch":"1.21","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Every winter solstice eve a monster comes into the village of Lonelywood and steals a child.

It was established by the famed adventurer and hotelier, Angus Clearwater twenty years ago when he retired from adventuring. In his days as an adventurer he saw many of his fellows fall needlessly because they simply lacked skill or experience. So when he retired he decided to dedicate his time and considerable fortune to educating and training wood-be adventures and heros.\n\nLike you.\n\nNOTES: \n\nThis is a simple character creator inspired by Berliad's FRW Character Creator. You can level up to level ten and buy some appropriate gear with which to equip yourself. You then export your character via the game's menu, and thus you have a new character ready to take on the mod of your choice at the recommended level. It doesn't do anything different than probably a lot of other mods but I tried to make it as interesting as possible. \n\nThe method by which your character improves him/herself is intensive training as opposed to magic.\n\nIt's based on the Wayfarer's Rest area and characters in the mod Traveller. It features a merchant who sells customised armor for the image conscious adventurer. It also features girls in their undies (and grow up content so might not be suitable for younger gamers).\n\nRequires Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir.\n\nAny constructive opinions and comments welcome.\n\nThe script used to level up the character is called ch_a_levelup. I don�t know if it�s an official script or if someone else has written it. If it�s your script would you let me know so I can give you credit.

Lore is recommended and to use a sword.\n- This module has Autosave function, mostly recommended to use only these (for the moment).\n- Strategy action, you will find only some places for resting. These are always near statues and possibly not so visible. After a rest you will recover your HPs and time will pass.\n- If Belegia dies, game over.\n- When you're playing the future role, you will find a \"ghost\" character in your party, this is normal, select the portraited character.\n- Try to not get confused with the \"time jumps\" and its relation to the journal.\n- About the sword panel: if you lose it, try to reequip the sword. If you're playing a poor resolution... maybe the panel shows in a corner mixing with other ui screens, you can move the sword panel clicking on the skull of the art represented sword.\n- Bardelor and the future pcs cannot level up.\n- The custom Crypt tileset by Witness has some camera problems, play it with strategy camera or you will get annoyed.\n- There are no cities and almost no stores in this module, play strategically trying to keep your healing resources (otherwise would be too easy).\n- Try to play it quietly and wisely, you will enjoy it more than running or xploiting.\n\n\n\n\n \nAUTHOR NOTES:\n--------------------------------\nRead before commenting or voting.\n\nKing for a Day is a very special, personal and experimental project and possibly much different of what you can find in other modules. First of all is based on the custom world Cielos Oscuros that has been alive 6 years thanks to nwn. It's a gift to those builders, players and lovers that always wanted to know how was Belegia's life.\n\nThis campaign will be divided in 4 parts: Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring. And everyone of them will have a different kind of gameplay, from action until roleplay or strategy.\n\nThis first module (Summer)is a prelude to the next adventures where you will begin at first level and you'll live pure action and long cutscenes most of all. It is inside a \"Hack n slash\" category because I thought the best way to introduce people to the custom enviroment of CO was some good action.\n\nSo, as designed, you won't find a module with many roleplay options, a city for resting, a romance, or many quests and subquests. \n\nPlot is linear, designed like this to act like a movie, but you will find some decision options and some easy puzzles. I'm trying to warn you of what you will find in this module and that the next chapters will change the gameplay fully. \n\nThe idea of showing the main character in a future was very risky and can be a little confusing, but the result is funny to play. I guess that this stuff , the number of cutscenes and the linear plot will never find their way in the next modules.\n\nMostly my work with NWN since 2002 has been mosty experimental, showing other builders what can be done with the toolset and KFAD I think will inspire many builders out there (custom content, scripts, systems, area design...), on the other hand, common players (and roleplay gurus) will feel odd, confused and possibly won't realize the work in the module. If you're a faithful and consagrated NWN player... my advice is playing it with an open mind.\n\nAbout the translation, after testing it in English I realized that semantics were very strong, translating from Spanish to English has been a wicked work cause the original written text in Spanish was in a classic medieval style, full of phrased stuff that has no real translation in English (I read words in the English translation that I never imagined they existed). Of course, there will be always some typos (as I saw and fixed many even when there was a native speaker review of the text). If you're a good English linguist don't hesitate to ask me for the text if you want to help.\n\nIf you want to discuss deeply this campaign, help or talk about it you can do it here Link\n\nor visit Link\n\n\n\n ","Rating":8.65,"Votes":12,"Awards":[]},"344":{"Name":"Brightstone Keep","Author":"BTG Team","Submitted":20090118,"Updated":20090125,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Module Types":"Classic PnP Conversion, Roleplay","Scope":"Medium","Content":"NA","Tricks & Traps":"NA","Roleplay":"NA","Hack & Slash":"NA","Min Character Level":"05","Max Character Level":"05","Gameplay Length":"04","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"BRIGHTSTONE KEEP is a Neverwinter Nights 2 (NWN2) module based on the Wizards of the Coast adventure \"Base of Operations\" by Ed Stark.

After that battle, the creatures and followers of Zorn continued to grow in numbers and eventually run the Charnians from their homes. The Charnians escaped into the forest and eventually crossed through a great mountain range via the mountain dwarves passage. On the other side of the mountain they began to build a small town with a few outlining villages. The followers of Zorn eventually stopped hunting the Charnians and returned to their lands. They began to lose focus (since there was no one to torment) and eventually separated into different clans and tribes based on race (goblins, orcs, ogres, dark dwarves, zornians, etc.) About 10 years ago your (the PC�s) father, Adwen, led a large group of Charnians in an attempt to return to Charnia. Since the attacks had pretty much ended, they felt that maybe Zorn's evil creatures had all destroyed each other and returning to Charnia would be safe. The caravan never returned. You and your brother were young at the time. Your mother has never recovered from the loss of her husband. A month ago your brother led a small group to try and find out what happened to the first caravan. They were only supposed to be gone for a couple of weeks, but haven't returned.

If you have these mods currently installed, please DELETE them before installing this package.\n\nInstallation \n\nThe NWN2-OC-MotB Romance Pack comes with two zip files. The FP_V1.7z file has to be un-zipped into your \n\nProgram Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override \n\ndirectory (NOT the My Documents one!) \n\nand the FP_Music.7z file has to be un-zipped into your \n\nProgram Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Music \n\ndirectory (NOT the My Documents one!). \n\nNew Content \n\nThis is a modification for the NWN2-OC that adds new dialogues, expansions to the existing dialogues and the flirt-pack for Bishop and Casavir, as well as the Wall scene for Neeshka, and flirts for all 6 romanceable characters (Bishop, Casavir, Neeshka, Gann and Saffiya). \n\nFlirt-packs are accessed via the main question menu, where the new option (Flirt with �) will appear. The flirts differ between acts or between the different stages of the relationship. The mod does not modify the influence over the characters, in order not to upset the game�s balance. The first lines of NWN1-style talks are voiced in Bishop�s Romance-OC, and the cutscenes with Neeshka and Bishop are fully voiced. Neeshka�s cutscene occurs if influence with her is higher than with Elanee.\n\nBishop Romance Specific Information: Two or three talks are �hidden� and will appear if certain events occurred and you tried to flirt with Bishop. You do not have to be evil-aligned or have high influence with Bishop to romance him. The last meeting with Bishop still requires high influence with him to eventually obtain a different conclusion.\n\nCasavir Romance Specific Information: Several talks are �hidden� and will appear if certain events occurred and you talk with Casavir. Additionally, if you missed a lovetalk, you can get it by talking to Casavir. You do not have to be good-aligned or have high influence with Casavir to romance him, however his reaction to some of the more aggressive flirts are more favorable if you are not evil and if you have a high influence with him. You can end the romance voluntarily by telling him that you do not appreciate all the attention (or by choosing suitably offensive replies) and restart it by telling him you are sorry for the misunderstanding, however the latter requires an influence of 5 or higher in Act 2 and 10 or higher in Act 3. Please note that the romance expansion does not disable any original content, so certain game events are still going to occur. You can always turn him down. Should you come to a point where you feel the testimony of a paladin might help you, and should you decide that you want Casavir to say a few words on your behalf, talk to Sand.\n\nNew Epilogues: We have added a number of new Epilogues in MotB for the OC romantic characters. In order to see the conclusions of your love-story for Casavir, Elanee and Neeshka, you need to reject the MotB love interest and specify which OC character you romanced; talk to Ammon Jerro and express hope that the loved one is alive. In Bishop�s case, you will need to prompt him to hold on to his life in the Wall scene and bargain with Kelemvor.\n\nContact Information \n\nThis mod was created is associated with the Gibberlings Three modding group.

After learning from an old sage that the object is inextricably linked to the nefarious organization known as the Night Masks, the player catches the next ship to Westgate in the hopes of uncovering the cure to the curse. Soon afterwards, the player is drawn into a vicious street war between factions. Players must choose their allegiance in order to break the curse and ultimately uncover a plot that threatens Westgate itself. The story begins on the 30th day of Marpenoth (October in our calendar), 1372 DR - sometime after the most recent documented events within the region.\nMysteries of Westgate has been designed to provide a balanced experience for all character races, classes, and alignments. As the module is very role-play-focused, classes with varied skills such as bards and rogues will, in some situations, have an easier time of it than melee-orientated classes. Conversely, characters with strong martial skills may have an easier time overcoming the terrifying array of enemies pitted against them, should combat prove inevitable. Paladins, and priests of good deities, may have a small advantage against the more fiendish or unholy enemies in the game.\nWe wanted to make alignment a real factor in Mysteries of Westgate. Most modern RPGs allow the player a certain amount of freedom, but draw the line at anything that will really affect the outcome of the story, funneling the player down a certain path as a story reaches its climax. While we appreciate the advantages of this approach, we wanted to do something more, to empower the player to make the choices a real chaotic evil character might. Therefore, in Mysteries of Westgate, actions have huge consequences. Whether the player is the scourge or savior of the city is ultimately up to them. \nPRODUCT FEATURES:\n\nA 15+ hour campaign of high adventure with multiple paths and endings for players to choose from - an ideal role-playing experience! \nNon-linear gameplay with plenty of sidequests to uncover and solve in different ways, including class-specific options. \nWell balanced so that even the weaker player classes, like bards, will have a fun time. \n4 new creatures including the wererat and quelzarn. \nA new Sewer tileset used to create the seedy underbelly of Westgate, with tunnels, vaulted ceilings, rusty pipes, deep pools, and bridges. \n25 minutes of hauntingly beautiful new music from composer David John. \nHundreds of lines of new, professional quality voice-over. \nMysteries of Westgate requires the original Neverwinter Nights 2 to play, but is also fully compatible with both the Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir expansion packs, allowing players to use the new classes, races, and other features from these games (expansions are not required to play Mysteries of Westgate). \n","Rating":9.1,"Votes":69,"Awards":["Hall of Fame","ReviewersAward.jpg"]},"363":{"Name":"The Innocent","Author":"Stradar","Submitted":20090407,"Updated":20090426,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Combat, Epic, Forest Adventure, Roleplay","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Heavy","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"20","Gameplay Length":"05","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Hello everyone im posting this to let you all know about my upcomeing series of The Innocent and 2 other chapters as well.

Enhanced versions of the SoZ death system and crafting system and the party editor system are implemented. NWN2 and both the MoTB and SoZ expansions are required.\n\nFor modders, threads on how the SoZ death system was implemented, the SoZ crafting system was implemented, and the SoZ party editor and party system was enabled are available in the Bioware NWN2 Forums (links and explanations below).\n\n-----------\nImplementing the SoZ death system in a campaign:\nLink\nWhen setting up the SoZ death system in my own campaigns this is what I have found:\n\nFirst, this will only work in campaigns. Using the campaign editor plugin set PartyMemberDying to TRUE. If you do not do this then the player will not bleed from -1 to -10, and will instead jump right from 0 to -10.\n\nThe required scripts from SoZ are:\nginc_death\nk_death_remove_gui\nk_mod_load (to be used as the module On Load script)\nk_mod_player_death (to be used as the module On Player Death script)\nk_mod_player_dying (to be used as the module On Player Dying script)\n\nk_mod_load contains some SoZ cohort specific code and some SoZ module specific trade code that can be commented out. The significant thing it is doing regarding the death system is this line:\nSetGlobalInt( VAR_GLOBAL_NX2_TRANSITIONS, TRUE);\n\nThis line makes sure that dead party members are transitioned with the party when switching areas. Like the US Marines, no one is left behind.\n\nIf you allow characters to die and your first PC does, then when you try to have any other party member converse with an NPC the dead body of the first PC will switch with the conversing party member. To avoid this you can set all NPCs to be able to talk to non player-owned creatures. An easy way to do this if you do not want to alter all of the creature blueprints you have is to take advantage of a line in the k_mod_load script:\nSetGlobalString(\"N2_SCRIPT_SPAWN_CREATURE\", \"kb_default_sp\" );\n\nThis line sets a script name to be executed for any creature being spawned in with the standard spawn in script. This can be used to control treasure on creatures, but can also be used to set the talk to non player-owned creatures. Look at the bb_kingsfestival_sp script in my Kings Festival campaign if you want to do this.\n\nA cautionary note about this: If you have NPCs set to speak to non player owned creatures then you may have a problem if you use the gb_surrender_hb script. This script causes a creature to surrender after being damaged and then start a conversation with the nearest party member. If the NPC is set to talk to non-player owned creatures then it may start a conversation with someone other than your currently selected PC, in which case the conversation will not work properly.\n\nk_mod_player_death is pretty clean and doesn't contain any SoZ specific code that can be removed. It executes the k_death_remove_gui script.\n\nk_mod_player_dying doesn't contain any SoZ specific code that can be removed.\n\nAs long as your companions use the standard gb_comp scripts they should be handled correctly.\n\nSo if all you want is to mimic the SoZ death system in your campaign the above should be enough.\n\nIn my campaigns I do quite a bit more though so that in easy mode the death system from the OC is used rather than the SoZ system. I also apply xp penalties for dying.\n\n-----------\nImplementing the SoZ Party Editor:\nLink\n\nImplementing the SoZ Crafting/Enchanting System:\nLink\n\nThese notes are also available at my blog bbellina.blogspot.com\n\nSee the Read Me file for additional information.\n\nCampaign patches should be applied after installation of the campaign. Patches must be applied in the order they were released.","Rating":8.33,"Votes":25,"Awards":[]},"368":{"Name":"Tears of Ilmarid 2 - The Blood War, v 1.1.1","Author":"Hohiro Kurita","Submitted":20090518,"Updated":20091011,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dramatic, Dungeon Adventure, Epic","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"12","Max Character Level":"15","Gameplay Length":"04","Categories":"Linear, story-driven, single player adventure.","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"The Blood War is the second module in the 'Tears of Ilmarid' campaign.

After braving pirates and an ancient, living, dungeon cursed by the actions of men nearly two thousand years dead, you arrived in Ilmarid. Rumors had been spreading here as well, and many supporters of the Princess' return have already begun to rally together. They were not the only ones who learned of the rumored return, however, as you discovered when the Archmage Kriev himself attempted to assassinate the Princess before the rebellion could even begin.

McKellar\n\nA single-player module for new characters.\nYou have grown up on the frontier of the Empire, getting by with a little hunting and the few head of cattle you raise with Dei'dre Dana'an, daughter of old ranger famous for his exploits during the last Goblin War. His Dana'an Rangers have kept the peace since then, but a new time of troubles is approaching, and soon you will be called to join their ranks and fight to restore the peace that was lost.\n\nLength: ~20 hours, level 1-10. (Level 12 or higher is possible)\nCustom Setting.\nLow gold, Low magic world.\nSequel: The Dana'an Unvanquished\n\nCLASS:\nMost of the combat in this module takes place on large, open exterior areas, in chaotic, fluid battles. As a result, Characters need to balance melee combat with speed, mobility, and stealth. Ranged weapons also become far more important. Rangers are ideally suited for this kind of combat, but other skilled combat types, like barbarians, monks, or rogues can also be effective. Casters are generally not supported, but Druids may do well.\n\nFEATURES:\n-NPC soldiers fight in squads, usings a variety of tactics, and will rout and flee if they are seriously wounded or if their leaders are killed.\n-Many quests can be completed using speed or stealth instead of brute force, but the player is generally free to improvise and use their own techniques.\n-A mixture of linear and free-form play. Set-piece battles are mixed in with sand-box elements like trading, smuggling, highway robbery, and hunting.\n-Some monster populations organically grow, raising young to replace those killed.\n-Terrain effects: Stealth, movement speed, and fortification bonuses.\n\nSKILLS:\nDisable Trap, Open Lock, and Search are not used. Tumble, Move Silently, Hide, Survival, and Heal can be very useful. A couple ranks in Lore will help. Cheap traps are available, so the Set Trap skill can be useful. Appraise, Diplomacy, Bluff, and Taunt have limited use in conversation.\n\nFEATS:\nRangers should chose Goblinoids and then Half-Orcs for their favored enemy. For two-weapon fighters who wish to take weapon-focus feats, there are pairs of high-level short swords, scimitars, and kamas available.\n\nITEMS:\nCharacter items will be stripped on load, but will be available in a store. Gold is stripped, but may be stolen back late in the game.\n\nThanks to Adonnay and Escriminator for the weapon haks, and Sunjammer for his VFX browser\n\nGAMEPLAY NOTES:\nAlignment: Few quests affect alignment, but killing civilian, good, or female creatures will result in a shift towards evil (hunt bucks, not does).\n\nRest and Respawn: Rest and respawn require food items (milk, meat, and Dana'an Stout/Meddygyln). These items are easily attained through hunting, gathering, or purchase. Some conversations will rest your character for free, and some items will heal or rest your character for free. Additionally, buying a drink in a tavern will rest you. On respawn, your character will receive 50% of their hit points, and will have a attack bonus penalty for 12 seconds. If you do not have a food item, you will respawn with 25% of your hitpoints and your AB penalty will last for 24 seconds.\n\nRoleplaying: Role-playing is limited to a few uses of diplomacy and bluff checks in conversation. Conversations are designed without multiple options, for the very simple reason that forcing the player to choose between pre-scripted responses doesn't really give them the chance to role-play their \ncharacter, using their own words, it just makes conversations more laborious. Role-playing in this module is handled in how you choose your character's actions, how they fight, who they choose to kill or let run-away, or how much time they spend trying to make money. If you want to spend a few hours clicking through conversation trees, this module isn't for you.\n\nCompanions: Companions are not necessary to complete the game, but will become available as you find them or complete certain side quests. Some companions will automatically leave your party for certain quests. Combat in this module can be quite chaotic and confusing, so managing companions in addition to your PC will often be more trouble than it is worth. If you lose a companion in combat, they will automatically leave your party, but you can use the party roster screen to add them back.\n\nHOTFIX v107.1\n-Fixed a potential bug with Exodus quest\n\nFIXES and ADDITIONS in v1.07\n-Buildings now burn properly in Exodus quest\n-Fixed bug with Bloody Marsh Conversations\n-Fixed potenial bug with extra Mosby in Exodus quest\n-Sapper's kegs now default to Bash\n-Imported some improvements to Tactical AI from The Danaan Unvanquished\n-Fixed potential graphical issue with MacBoru's Barn\n-Terrain textures changed\n-Fortification terrain changed to used concealment effect\n\nFIXES and ADDITIONS in v1.06\n-Area lighting adjusted, night and twilight now not so dark\n-Interior areas now brighter at night\n-Module hour length increased from 1 to 2\n-Various bug fixes\n-Autosaves added before major battles\n-Goblins now carry stone axes\n-Xiphon and Gladius short swords added\n-Music issues with Shiloh Creek fixed\n-Minor fixes to various conversations\n-Cache blueprints added to most areas\n-Killing Goblin Wenches now only gives you a 1 point hit to alignment\n\nFIXES and ADDITIONS in v1.05\n-New rest and respawn system added\n-Bartender and other minor conversation options added to support rest system\n-Check added to prevent possible bug with Akabah quest (Johnston)\n-Wang Beihu's alignment set to Lawful Neutral (Allows progression as monk)\n-Prices for Musgrove Trading Post and Capt Butler fixed\n-Madb Morrigu encounter added\n-Port Royal Customs House stocked with guards and lootable chests\n-Debug messages removed from World quest\n-Issue with ogres not respawning for Nymph quest resolved\n-Debug message removed from guard triggers\n-Check added to prevent possible bug with Exodus quest (McLaws)\n-Goblins corpses in the Wadi Al Khanal no longer selectable\n-Wild Boar corpses no longer selectable\n-Dana'an Tomahawk rebalanced to be cheaper\n-Minor fixes to various conversations\n-Goblin Lords now have a higher CR and give more XP","Rating":9.41,"Votes":91,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"372":{"Name":"ALFA Books","Author":"bartleby12804","Submitted":20090611,"Updated":20090613,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Module Types":"","Scope":"NA","Content":"NA","Tricks & Traps":"NA","Roleplay":"NA","Hack & Slash":"NA","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"01","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is a version 1.0 release of the book system Im working on for A Land Far Away.

It was an adventure where the player typed commands in a command line user interface and got response back in written from. Like: \n>Game: �You see a large tree, what do you want to do?� \n>Player: �Cut down tree�\n>Game: �With what do you want to chop down the tree with?�\n>Player: �Cut tree with knife�\n>Game: �You start to cutting the tree with your pocket knife but soon realize that it would take you a lifetime.�\n\nYou get the idea. This is an adaption of that game and it's done using Neverwinter Nights 2. It can never be the same game as the original but what I felt when I played Zork I all those thousands of years ago are inside it. It will absolutely differ from other players perception of it, but that could never be my responsibility.\n\nBut apart from that, the game is not DnD or any other RPG. If you are looking for serious role playing or a hack and slash feast you might be disappointed as this is mainly a puzzle adventure. If you like games like Myst or Riven but want to be able to move around in a 3D world and feel more inside the game I think this module is a great one. Anyway, I hope you give it a try.\n\nYou probably find most answers to you questions in the walkthrough, but if there's still some questions don't hesitate to ask them in the forum at nwn2zork.freeforums.org. If if find a bug or another issue please report them there.\n\nAnd remember, ZORK I was a really difficult game. So even if I've removed lots of things you could screw up the game with and introduced several clues and straightened up the logical flow - it's still a very hard game to beat. \n\nDon't hang down you head if you need to consult the walkthrough or the endless resources of the Internet (yes the original maps and hint books are valid for this module).\n\nEnjoy, and don't let the Grue bite you!\n\n/Amraphael\n\n\nUPDATES: \n\nTuesday, March 16, 2010\n* Added files for manual install below.

However , playing as a paladin is not advisable as in one area it would be\nimpossible for a paladin to continue and not spend the rest of his/her life in some temple repenting for \nseverely breaking the law ...\n\n You will have two companions a monk and a rogue ( one male , one female ) they are both absolutely vital \nto the story and both are romanceable,however this happens quite fast so be nice / flatter them early on \nif you want it to happen ( will start upstairs in the halfling tavern if you've been charming enough). Talk to them both as they have quite a lot to say for themselves , if you have \nno questions to ask try again later .\n\n To make sense I recommend being no more than 30 years old , human , half elf or elf ( however some \narmour will not fit female elves )and please do not play as one of the vertically challenged races \n( dwarf , halfling or gnome ) ,you will see why and it could ruin the game for you . Half Orcs and \nGenasi etc would also leave your mother with a lot of explaining to do and look ridiculous....!\n\n In a lot of places there is no going back ( there'll be a lot of people after you ) so make use of \nmerchants whenever they are available.\n\n There is no crafting but there should be enough magic items to keep you happy and I hope I have catered \nfor all weapon types too .\n\n Conversation skills are not necessary and I would recommend combat and casting skills ( inc. use magic \nitems ) and a few sneaky ones for good measure , survival and tracking can be useful too..\n\n With regards to roleplay there are choices but only when it matters so not every conversation has a list\nof replies to scroll through , this is basically a story and you are the hero/heroine so just go with the \nflow and try to roleplay yourself into the character not the other way around .By all means kill or help \nwho you want but you will not influence the outcome dramatically...\n\n *******************************************************\n\n I have never used the toolset before I started this so your characters journey is mine too , you'll \nnotice the journal gets used a lot at the beginning ( only way I knew how to keep a track on progress) \nand areas improve with time .

Nay, to say hack and slash is going too far. This module is for hackers only. Slashers need not apply. And those who want \"story\", linear or otherwise, can forget it entirely!\n\nThe evil wizard Gurgal Sang of Shadizar has tricked you into meeting him and, as punishment for some real or imagined slight against his god Set, has thrown you - or at least the essence of your being - into a massive, perhaps infinite, dungeon called the Maze. The Maze occupies a space between worlds, and consists of small isolated demi-planes connected by magical portals. You may try and hide in the dungeon, languishing until your life runs its natural course, die in a blaze of glory fighting all the other trapped individuals and monsters within the Maze or dare to hope for escape.\n\nThe module caters for any party, from a single 1st level PC to a party of 30th level PCs. Module features include large outdoor and indoor areas, and procedurally generated entries, exits and encounters throughout.\n\nYou may come across just about anything in the NWN2 bestiary, and many more creatures besides, as well as environmental hazards, random secret doors, random traps, random custom Hyborian treasures, pit traps, cages, Hyborian deity-specific shrines, magical fonts, teleport traps, portable exploding barrels, green slime, brown mould, shriekers, ear seekers and other inspirations from the 1st edition random dungeon system.\n\nNote for Modders: If you are one of those talented individuals who likes to make area prefabs but not necessarily whole adventures, know that the way I scipted Hyborian Hack it takes me about 1 minute to attach an area as an additional demi-plane complete with usual encounters. If interested in contributing please let me know.

This is the Beta for a Story-driven Ravenloft Module based to some extent on the Ravenloft novel Vampire of the Mists.\n\nYou will be playing a Sun Elf Necromancer named Solalis Ionius which is included in the .rar as a .bic file, but any other elf/half elf wizard/necromancer will do, if you choose another class or race it is possible to play though but you may find some confusion if you do so.\n\nHack and slash is rated low and you could theoretically get through the game with only fighting a couple battles.\n\nRemember that though there is a straight path through the game there is more endings then the common one for which everyone expects, but you have to go out and search for them. Pay mind to your journals and any books you should find. \n\nSave often, I can't stress that enough.\n\nAs this is a beta I ask for any help in finding any bugs, glitches, grammatical errors I missed in my countless iterations or any confusion with the dialogues or story elements. \n\n\n\n////////////////////////////////\nInstallation for the Ravenloft Revelations Beta (also included as a text document within the download)\n\n\n1.

Please test it and state any last bugs or concerns. I'll try to deal with them before release which is approximately planned for October 28-29th. There will still be updates after release which can't be helped, but hopefully most of the problems will be alleviated before then so take care to look over it carefully.\n\nChanges this update:\n-Misty Woods has been renovated.\n-The grammar, syntax, and spelling have been fixed for those mentioned.\n-The doors going outside the hallway have been made invulnerable.\n-More signs to indicate your new housing at the former Clinic.\n-Burgomaster's daughter should now have different conversions based on if you met her or not before leaving the castle.\n-New Weapons and Armor have been added to the shops.\n-Fixes to conversation conditions to alleviate a few bugs that popped up.\n-New sidequest at the Gypsy Camp.\n\n\n(Update 004 is now uploaded)\nThe aforementioned issues have been fixed. These include fixes to the:\n1.) Syntax and grammer errors mentioned have been fixed. \n2.) The rugs have been fixed in both libraries, and a few other areas.\n3.) Doors have been replaced.\n4.) Conditions have been added to prevent the player from speaking to the barkeep first before they speak with the Gnome in the bar for the Tab Debt Quest.\n5.) More walkmeshes cutters have been added to prevent one from passing through objects. These mostly fall under the ones in the Mansion.\n6.) Some of the areas in the castle have had their player maps fixed so the players can more clearly see the areas they are in.\n7.) There is a new NPC in the house called Birdbrain, who may provide more insight on the exact circumstances behind the Doctor's madness.\n8.) Items have been added to most of the bosses. Also, their bodies should remain on the screen until after you loot them.\n9.) Minor visual and graphical fixes also included. This includes a visual effect to indicate that the book has appeared on your bed after you return from the Throne Room. Librarian also has a conversation node that will give you another indication on how to get out if you misinterpreted the journal, and the note. Finally, there is a trigger added in the hallway near the locked door there.\n\n\n(Update 003 is now uploaded)\n\n[new hak required so be sure to delete the other one and replace with the newer version]\n\nA great deal of work has been spent filling in loose ends:\n\nNow there is a optional dialog with Helen in the castle in-between the beginning scenes. Also hidden quest later in the game. New hak required for one so bear that in mind.\n\nThe doctor has more of a presence, and even a quest associated with him.\n\nLuna's dialog is fixed but still require you to wait for the final dialog.\n\nQuests: Player given a better idea on where and how to continue quests.\n\nMinor Flavor text updates to objects and some conversations.\n\nShakeskull can now take you back to your town laboratory from Barovia Castle.\n\nThe game endings have been updated. The true endings still have to be discovered on your own. So take care to explore.\n\nThe dead horse conversation now gives a clear indication as to what item in your inventory to use to resummon the dead horse.\n\nSyntax is still a ongoing project, but I have put a great deal of effort into this and the repaired more noticeable anomalies.\n\n\n(Update 002)\n\nEverything should be fixed that was announced with two exceptions:\n\nSyntax is always subjective, but I did a great deal of refinement and it should be better then it was previously.\n\nThe cutscene black bars do not to be functioning beyond the first conversation, and I'm perplexed as to why. I'm attempting to repair that, but unless I isolate the problem it may have to continue into the final version, so any suggestions on how to repair that is appreciated.\n\nThough not critical, the Helen issue is still being worked, and I should have it in the next update.\n\nThe Beta continues so if you find any other bugs with this main version then please bring them to my attention.\n\n\n\n\n\\","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"383":{"Name":"Rebirth","Author":"Strange One","Submitted":20090824,"Updated":20090915,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dungeon Adventure, Roleplay, Twisted / Dark","Scope":"Large","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"02","Gameplay Length":"01","Categories":"Roleplay, Dark/Twisted, Dungeon Adventure","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"In \"Rebirth\" you find yourself banished to Limbo, a dimension where lost souls with no where else to go gather, with no memory of you former life.

The NPC is a rogue, but this should not stop you playing the same if this suits you.\n\nThe module is very much story driven requiring a small amount of role play. Hack and slash is low, though for many of the combats it is useful to have scrolls and healing potions to hand, especially if you are a spell casting class.\n\nFinally I hope you enjoy this mod, please leave feedback on the forum. In order that I could complete this I have left some story lines open to allow me to extend the story into a part two, your feedback will make this project both more like likely and of a higher quality.\n\nThis module has been created by me and the work and ideas are mine. That is not to say I have not been influenced by things I have played and read so there may be some ideas in there that sound familiar. If so thank you to the broad casters that sowed these seeds.\n\nI would also like to thank the people on the builders forum who have patiently helped me with my questions and specifically UncleFB. All of the custom scripts in this mod were written by FB and his NPC control program breaths life into the market square.\n\nStuff you should know: \n\nThere is one file for the modules folder and one for the the HAK folder in the my docs Neverwinter nights. The file runs as a module not as a campaign.\n\n1.Talk to everyone, at different times of the day as well � the time at which you talk to certain people will affect the way the conversation pans out.\n2.You may choose to be nice to people or not, it does affect the outcome and the helpfulness of some NPC's.\n3.I was not able to create a stable and interesting dice game, therefore don't play that conversation string just in order to win money � you will always loose - sorry lose :-)\n4.In two places the conversations with placeable objects don't fire on the first left click. I don't know why and was not able to fix this. They do fire on the second click so hang in there. These are a shed and a sundial � you will know when you see them. \n\n\nVersion 3 is now up and can be downloaded. I have posted the fix list below. I hope you enjoy playing the mod.\n\nThings you should know. \n\n1.The way I have balanced this module means that your hardest ride will be with a cleric.\n2.The mod ends when you open the inn door. Sometimes it's instant, sometimes there is a second or so delay, but it does fire the ending so just give it time and don't pass through the door. \n\nPlease enjoy sheep and stone, and mind your fingers in those doors.\n\nNew at version 4\n\n\n1. I have created a new start area and cut scene to give your character some more background on the fleecing which is only mentioned in text in the current version.\n2. The start is more open, you can now wander round Lakeside before meeting Samuel the overseer and pick up quests in a different order. This foils some of the linearity of the previous opening.\n3. I have fixed all bugs mentioned in comments accept for the placeable problems. I do not know how to fix these (but you do need SoZ and MoTB to play this with all textures in place).\n4. I have updated to 1.23.\n5. I have overhauled most of the areas to provide continuity into the caravan club and to make them look pretty.\n6. I have been through all the convos again on a typo hunt. \n7. I have toughened up some of the encounters.\n8. I have streamlined some of the dialogue and created options where there were none before. There was always some roleplay, now there's more.\n9. I have added possibilities for skill uses. I counted ten places in previous versions for using dialogue skills. I know have 20 � 30 places where bluff, intimidate, diplomacy, intelligence, perform and apparise can make a difference (ok then, only one place where perform makes a difference).\n10. I have relit all the areas � I have been amazed at the difference it makes (thanks to ciViLiZed for that comment).\n11. I have sorted the seated npc talking issues (by using NWN1 style in some places.\n\nVersion 41\n\n1. I have fixed a bug whereby Ember might not join you if a certain conversation string was followed. Ember is needed or most convos will not progress.\n\nNew at version 5.\n\n1.The mod now plays as a campaign in preparation for the conjoining of this and subsequent modules.\n2.I have created several new areas and improved existing ones.\n3.I have added two new sub quests and several new locations/encounters of interest. \n4.The ending is reworked to make it more interesting and to prevent the running away bug that caused a trigger to fire when it should not have.\n5.I have extended and rescripted one area to add more interest and liven up game play.\n6.In all I have added arouns 45 minutes more to the mod and sufficient exp to ensure your character reaches 4th level.\n\nThis module has been tested with Kaedrins prc pack int he override and works well.\n\nNote that the mod now is packed as a file format and not a module file. Functionaly this makes no difference but please read the instructions carefully for installation.\n\nI hope you enjoy the module, please leave me feedback if you come across any bugs though I hope that does not happen.\n\nThanks for all who have downloaded, please pass on your comments, I appreciate and value them.\n\nPJ\n\n","Rating":8.73,"Votes":71,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"392":{"Name":"Search for the Temple of the Golden Spire","Author":"Clyordes","Submitted":20091021,"Updated":20110430,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Classic PnP Conversion, Dungeon Adventure, Final Version, Forest Adventure","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"03","Gameplay Length":"06","Categories":"Classic P&P Conversions","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"SEARCH FOR THE TEMPLE OF THE GOLDEN SPIRE.\nAs the cool autumn evening draws in, you arrive at the quiet forest village of Greywood.

Little do you suspect what's waiting for you ahead......\n\n\nThis is a conversion of an old (1983) AD&D adventure from White Dwarf Scenarios 2. \n\nI've tried to keep the P&P feel as much as possible, and be aware that this was originally a competition module - some encounters are meant to be too dangerous to survive, so learn to scout & weigh up your chances before charging in sword first. In case you're not playing a class that can scout easily, there are companions of most common classes around the village, along with heavy hitters to help you out.\n\n\nWHO�S IT FOR?\nIts aimed at a party of 1st level characters - either single player with the companions available locally, or a group of real live human players - whichever you prefer.\nWith a high level character you could run through the entire adventure in 30 minutes, but a starting level party will probably take a couple of evenings at least.\n\n\nDEATH:\nThis isn't good for your health!

This requires the NWN2 OC, MoTB expansion, and the SoZ expansion.\n\nThis collection is specifically designed for use with the NWN2 OC.\n\nThe author, Brendan Bellina (aka Kaldor Silverwand in the NWN2 forums and NWN2 Vault), is not in any way responsible for any use of the components in this collection. This collection is provided for free and without warranty. Grateful missives may be directed to bbellina@alumni.nd.edu.\n\nThe makeover can be applied either before beginning or after beginning the Neverwinter Nights 2 campaign. If applied after already beginning a campaign then the recipe books and Campaigner's Guide wlll not be available (these are not required anyway) and NPC's in already loaded modules will not be able to be spoken to except by the main PC.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nStarting with version v20101126 many features can be customized by editing two 2da files included with the Makeover with a text editor such as Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Macintosh). There is no longer a need to use the Toolset to customize the features. See section \"Customizing the Makeover Features\" below to learn how to customize the features.\n\nAdditions to Player Menu:\nOptions to open the Party Editor and the Player Chat are available in the Player Menu.\n\n(The default player menu is condensed. If you prefer a slightly larger menu then navigate to the C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign\\UI folder and rename playermenu_popup.xml to playermenu_popup-small.xml, and rename playermenu_popup-large.xml to playermenu_popup.xml.)\n\nParty Creation:\nSoZ Party Creation is enabled. This allows up to 6 player created party members (one of which is the main PC) in addition to the standard OC companions. Party Members are created via the Party Editor option in the Player Menu. The Party Editor option can be accessed at any time. This is comparable to the guestbooks used in SoZ.\n\n(The number of party members allowed can be altered by altering the Campaign properties using the toolset Campaign plug-in. Unfortunately this cannot be altered except by using the NWN2 Toolset.)\n\nEnhancement of the initial provisioning chest:\nThere is a chest for provisioning in the initial room at the start of Act I. The chest has been enhanced to include the recipe books, a Campaigners Guide that explains features of the Makeover, a few coins of life, and recognizes the player classes introduced in MoTB and SoZ. The chest will provide equipment when opened by the main PC and any created party members.\n\nMulti-classing Companions:\nCompanions in the OC can be multi-classed when leveling up. It is not recommended that you do this with Khelgar since he has special issues in the OC.\n\nNPC Conversation enhancement:\nAll NPC's that have the standard spawn script (most of them) can be conversed with by any member of the party rather than just the main PC. Because most conversations in the OC are designed to be with the main PC only there may be bugs introduced by using party members for important conversations.\n\nDeath and Bleeding System:\nWhen the game is played on Normal or higher difficulty mode the SoZ Death system will be applied to the party members. In addition an XP penalty will be applied to characters when they are killed. Party members will remain dead when killed and will be valid targets for resurrection. One exception to this is Amie who because of her special role in the OC cannot be resurrected once killed. Because the OC requires companions to be alive often during transitions and conversations unexpected behavior may occur if an OC companion is dead at such a time. Death will cause a permanent experience point loss to the character. The Coins of Life used in the SoZ will be available to be used to resurrect dead characters.\n\nPlaying in Easy mode will cause the death system to behave as it does in the unmodified OC except that there will be an XP penalty applied when dying. This XP penalty will not be enough to cause de-leveling.\n\nRest System:\nThe rest system implemented causes the party to rest for 8 hours. When the game is played on Normal or higher difficulty mode resting is restricted to once in an 8 hour period and restricted to natural areas. The Makeover does not implement the rest and wandering monster system used by MotB or SoZ. (Note: Resting is allowed in the final area of the game even though it is a manmade area.)\n\nItem Level Restriction:\nEquippable enchanted weapons and armor can be restricted to use based on the level of enchantment and the level of the person attempting to equip the item. A person must have 2 levels of experience more than the level of enchantment. This is not a feature of SoZ but was added in the Makeover to attempt to keep the OC in balance.\n\nRechargeable staves, wands, and rods:\nStandard staves, wands, and rods can be recharged by making them the target of arcane spells. This is not a feature available in SoZ. Nothing forces you to use this feature, but if you want to make it impossible to use then do not copy the folder Rechargeable Mage Items into the campaign folder.\n\nEnhanced SoZ Crafting and Enchanting:\nAll items that can be crafted in SoZ can also be crafted in the OC using the existing workbenches in the OC. Items that require trade resources in SoZ to craft will require an equivalent wood or ingots found in the OC. Recipes are automatically placed in the Recipe Books, as in SoZ, however the recipe books are no longer cursed and can be given to any party member to carry. Also, unlike SoZ, recipes do not need to be in a recipe book in order to be used. Recipes and components will be randomly available in standard OC stores. The recipes and components are added to the store inventory only the first time a store is opened. Each store has a 66% chance of having recipes and components. There is no guarantee that all recipes and components will be available, but with the high number of stores in the OC it is likely that all recipes will be available somewhere. Items are normally limited to 3 enchantments unless the caster is an epic caster (> 20 levels) in which case 4 enchantments can be applied. Several item properties no longer count against the number of enchantments, including: light, visual effects, racial/class/alignment restrictions, and penalizing properties (curses). Masterwork items (identified by tag ending in _mast) are no longer penalized by having one fewer enchantment allowed. The inherent properties of items based on their material type will no longer count against the number of enchantments on the item (this is based on the standard tag names and is not guaranteed to work with non-standard items).\n\nA few stores are guaranteed to have SoZ items:\n- Branson's Shop in Highcliff will have low level recipes and common crafting components\n- Simmy in Old Owl Well will have healing items, medium level recipes, and common crafting components\n- Nya in Port Llast will have healing items, medium level recipes, and rare crafting components\n- Mage's store in Blacklake will have healing items, high level recipes and rare crafting components\n\nA number of additional items that were intended to be craftable in SoZ but were not due to bugs and/or missing recipes or items can also be crafted. These include:\n- Acid Bomb\n- Fire Bomb\n- Bracers of Armor +4\n- Gauntlets of Dexterity +2\n- Adamantine Breastplate\n- Poison Bolts\n- Darksteel Darts\n- Darksteel Shuriken\n- Darksteel Throwing Axes\n- Cold Iron Halberd\n- Darksteel Halberd\n\nFixed crafted items include:\n- Adamantine arrows (added magical +2 damage)\n- Adamantine bolts (added magical +2 damage)\n\nAll SoZ Enchantments are available. Only enchantments that are available in the OC are available in the Makeover.\n\nClock/time display in the Player Menu:\nThe sun/moon clock is displayed in the Player Menu.\n\nCompanion Conversations updated so that you can take their gear even when they are not currently in the party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nCustomizing the Makeover Features:\n\nThe behavior of the rest system, death system, and Item Level Restriction system can be customized by editing the 2da file \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign\\NWN2 OC Makeover SoZ Edition\\mo_oc_options.2da\".\n\nThe behavior of the crafting system can be customized by editing the 2da file \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign\\NWN2 OC Makeover SoZ Edition\\SoZCraftingPlus\\SoZCraftingPlus_options.2da\".\n\nEach of these files can be edited using a standard text editor such as Windows Notepad (just start Notepad and drag the file to edit into the open Notepad window) or Mac OS X TextEdit (just drag the file to edit onto the TextEdit application icon in the Applications folder or Dock). These files are read when when a module is loaded, so it is recommended that you save your game before editing them and then reload your saved game after editing them. A 2da file is simply a spreadsheet-like text file containing rows and columns. Each row has an integer identifier, starting with value 0, and several columns of data. The columns are delimited by spaces. While they can be edited using the toolset, the author does not recommend that.\n\nIn each file the columns are:\n- Row ID (For NWN2 2da's the ID column has no column header)\n- LABEL - this is the name of the feature. These must not be edited.\n- ENABLED - This indicates whether a feature is enabled (\"1\") or not (\"0\") or enablement is not relevant (\"****\").\n- VALUE - An integer value that is relevant to the feature. If no value is relevant then the column will contain \"****\".\n- DESCRIPTION - A complete explanation of the feature, its allowed range of values, and its effect on game play.\n\nThe rows in the default mo_oc_options.2da file are:\n\n LABEL ENABLED VALUE DESCRIPTION\n0 GAMEDIFF 0 0 \"GAMEDIFF adjustment: 1 for knockout death and no death penalty and no rest restrictions; 2 for knockout death and no rest restrictions)\"\n1 MIN_HR_BETWEEN_REST 1 8 \"Minimum number of hours required between resting (ignored in very easy or easy Game Difficulty Mode or when GAMEDIFF = 1 or 2)\"\n2 NATURAL_RESTING_ONLY 1 **** \"Restrict resting to natural areas (ignored in very easy or easy Game Difficulty Mode or when GAMEDIFF = 1 or 2)\"\n3 KNOCKOUT_DEATH 0 **** \"Use knockout death system (automatic when Game Difficulty Mode is set to very easy or easy or when GAMEDIFF = 1 or 2)\"\n4 XP_DEATHPENALTY 1 **** \"Apply an xp death penalty when a party member dies (ignored in very easy or easy Game Difficulty Mode or when GAMEDIFF = 1)\"\n5 ILR_NWN 0 **** \"Enforce Item Level Restriction for all equipped items based on NWN value table (which is based on item cost)\"\n6 ILR_NWN_ADJ **** 0 \"Integer adjustment (positive or negative) to item value when using ILR_NWN\"\n7 ILR_NWN_DIV **** 0 \"Divide the required level by this integer when using ILR_NWN (0 is treated as 1)\"\n8 ILR_ENHBONUS 1 **** \"Use Item Level Restriction on Enhanced Weapons where minimum level required to use is Weapon Enhancement Bonus plus 2\"\n9 ILR_ENHBONUS_MULT2 0 **** \"Require 2*Enh Bonus levels rather than 2+Enh Bonus levels when using ILR_ENHBONUS\"\n10 ILR_ACBONUS 1 **** \"Use Item Level Restriction on Enhanced Armor where minimum level required to wear is Armor AC Bonus plus 2\n11 ILR_ACBONUS_MULT2 0 **** \"Require 2*AC Bonus rather than 2+AC Bonus when using ILR_ACBONUS\"\n\nThe most common user requests have been to disable the SoZ death/dying system, disable the XP death penalty, disable the rest restrictions, and disable the Item Level Restriction feature. By default these features are all enabled. The rows in the 2da file allow control over each of these settings.\n\nGAMEDIFF (row 0) if enabled (ENABLED set to 1) and set to value 1 will replace the SoZ Death/Dying sysem with the Knockout system used by the unmodified OC, eliminate the XP death penalty, and remove the rest restrictions. If enabled (ENABLED set to 1) and set to value 2 it will use the Knockout system and remove the rest restrictions but leave in place the XP death penalty. If ENABLED is 0 then any value is ignored.\n\nMIN_HR_BETWEEN_REST (row 1) and NATURAL_RESTING_ONLY (row 2) allow specific control over the rest system. If you wish to only disable the rest restrictions then change the value in the enabled column of these rows to 0. These rows are ignored if GAMEDIFF is enabled and set to value 1 or 2.\n\nKNOCKOUT_DEATH (row 3) and XP_DEATHPENALTY (row 4) allow specific control over the death system. To use the OC death system enable KNOCKOUT_DEATH (ignored if GAMEDIFF is enabled and set to value 1 or 2). To disable the XP Death Penalty set the ENABLED column of the XP_DEATHPENALTY row to 0 (ignored if GAMEDIFF is enabled and set to value 1).\n\nThe remaining rows (5-11) affect the Item Level Restriction feature. If ILR_NWN (row 5) is enabled then ILR_NWN_ADJ (row 6) and ILR_NWN_DIV (row 7) can optionally have values, otherwise they are ignored. To completely disable Item Level Restriction set the ENABLED column to 0 for ILR_NWN (row 5), ILR_ENHBONUS (row 8), and ILR_ACBONUS (row 10).\n\nThe rows in the default SoZCraftingPlus_options.2da file are:\n\n LABEL ENABLED VALUE DESCRIPTION\n0 CONVERT_GOODS 1 **** \"Convert SoZ goods requirements to standard goods\"\n1 CONVERT_RARERES 1 **** \"Convert SoZ rare resource requirements to standard resources\"\n2 ENCH_ALLOW_SATCHEL 0 **** \"Allow satchel to be used for enchanting in place of mage bench\"\n3 CFT_ALLOW_SATCHEL 0 **** \"Allow satchel to be used for crafting in place of mage bench\"\n4 CFT_ALLOW_MORTAR 0 **** \"Allow Mortar and Pestle to be used for crafting in place of alchemist bench\"\n5 CFT_ALLOW_HAMMER 0 **** \"Allow smith hammer to be used for crafting in place of craftsman/smith bench\"\n6 XP_CRAFT_PCT 0 10 \"Reduce crafter's xp by specified percentage of gold cost when crafting\"\n7 XP_ENCH_PCT 0 25 \"Reduce enchanter's xp by specified percentage of gold cost when enchanting\"\n8 DESTROY_RECIPES 0 **** \"Allow the possibility of recipes being destroyed when used\"\n9 DESTROY_RECIPE_MIN **** 1 \"Integer minimum percentage risk (0-99) of a recipe being destroyed when DESTROY_RECIPES enabled\"\n10 DESTROY_RECIPE_MULT **** 0 \"Integer multiplier used in calculating risk of a recipe being destroyed. Higher numbers increase risk.\"\n\nWith these default settings:\n- Soz recipes that require SoZ specific goods or rare resources will require appropriate bars and planks;\n- mobile enchanting/crafting using the satchel, mortar and pestle, and smithhammer is not allowed;\n- crafting/enchanting will not consume xp from the crafter/enchanter;\n- and there is no possibility that a recipe will be consumed by its use.\n\n-----------------------\n\nStory alterations:\n\nRibsmasher can become a temporary henchman in several areas of Act II (Riverguard Keep, Temple of Seasons, the Gem Mines, and Shadow West Harbor).\n\nOption to restore Shandra to life following her sacrifice in the Haven.\n\nAll four of Nasher's items may be found in the game, instead of just the boots (found in Highcliff) and ring (which can be purchased from Nya in Port Llast), and as indicated in their descriptions when all four are equipped additional enhancements are applied (both the cloak and gloves may be obtained in Act III: the cloak is in the dragon hoard and the gloves are given by as a reward by Kana for successfully trouncing the bugbears).\n\nRooms can be rented at the Alliance Arms Inn in Port Llast and the Moonstone Mask in Neverwinter.\n\n-----------------------\n\nKnown limitations:\n\nThere is no Overland Map\n\nThere is no SoZ party conversation, although you may use any party member to speak to NPC's.\n\nParty members should not be dropped when transitions occur, but just in case save often.\n\nWhen new party companions are introduced to (or forced into) the party you may need to export player-created party members in order to add the companions to the party and then reimport the player-created companions. Exporting and importing player created party members can be done using the Party Editor.\n\nCompanions may pop back to life or stand when dead if they are involved in cutscenes. This may also affect player created characters. Save often.\n\nYou cannot resurrect Amie. Don't waste a coin of life on her. She's dead, Jim. If you want to play a campaign with Amie try the author's Harvest of Chaos: King's Festival campaign. The MotB Makeover SoZ Edition also allows the possibility of altering Amie's fate and playing her as a party companion.\n\nBefore changing to or from easy game difficulty, save the game. Reload after changing the difficulty setting.\n\n-----------------------\n\nSPECIAL NOTE FOR PREVIOUS USERS OF THE MAKEOVER:\n\nIf you have already installed a version of the Makeover prior to v20101126 then prior to installing v20101126 or later versions you should navigate to the folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign\\UI\" and delete the folder \"Multiclass companions\". Starting with v20101126 it is no longer needed with the Makeover.\n\n-----------------------\n\nPatch History:\n\nAll patches must be applied in the order they were released. \n\n----------------- \n20101126: Release Nov 26, 2010\n- Correct inventory icon display problem when leveling up\n- Correct display of appropriate clothing when leveling up\n- Change party editor display so that created party members are listed rather than companions. This has the side-effect of reordering the party icons when the party editor is opened.\n- Allow module variables controlling rest, death, ILR, and crafting to be modified in 2da files rather than requiring script changes\n- Force campaign spawn script to be defined each time a module is loaded, instead of only once\n- Updated Campaign Adventurers Guide text\n- Added debug items bb_it_varsreport and bb_it_sozcraftingplusreport\n- Changes to k_mod_load, k_mod_player_dying, and k_mod_player_death to support campaign options in the campaign options 2da (mo_oc_options.2da)\n- Provided both condensed and large player menus. The condensed menu is used by default, but the large menu is also installed into the campaign UI folder and can be used by renaming it.\n\n----------------- \nPatch 2011-02-10 - This patch updates the crafting system \n\n----------------- \nPatch 2011-05-29 - This patch corrects a bug in the item crafting system that was blocking the crafting of items that have no spell requirements. \n\n----------------- \nPatch 2011-11-06 - This corrects the blueprints for crafted poison arrows and mild poison arrows. \n\n----------------- \nPatch 2012-04-13 - This patch allows crafting to be done by Warlocks who have the Imbue Item feat and a high enough UMD; changes the calculation of spell caster level when enchanting to use class levels and the Practiced Spellcaster feat; adds scythe recipes to the medium level recipe, and adds meditate, drop unequipped inventory, and character visibility options to the player context menu.\n\n-----------------\nPatch 2012-10-12 - Further enhancements to the crafting system:\nNo longer allows enchanting unidentified items\n\nWhen specifying in a recipe that a bench is required a greater variety of text can be used as follows:\n- Requirement for a mage bench can be indicated by nx2_mage_bench, PLC_MR_MWBench, PLC_MC_CBENCH03, magical_bench, magical, or any string with \"mage_bench\" in it.\n- Requirement for an alchemy bench can be indicated by nx2_alch_bench, PLC_MR_AWBench, PLC_MC_CBENCH01, alchemy_bench, alchemy, or any string with \"alch_bench\" in it.\n- Requirement for a smith bench can be indicated by nx2_smith_bench, PLC_MR_WWBench, PLC_MC_CBENCH02, PLC_MC_WBENCH01, workbench, blacksmith, or any string with \"smith_bench\" in it.\nNote that this does not change the requirement that the actual placeable have a standard bench tag.\n\nCredit to Marc Allard and The Complete Craftsman mod by ChainsawXIV for requesting and inspiring the following enhancements regarding enchantments:\n- The CheckEnchantmentNumber function no longer counts Light, Visual effects, use limitation, inherent material bonuses, and penalizing properties against the maximum enchantment allowed number.\n- Enchantments that do not count against the number of enchantments (light, VFX, use limitation, penalizing properties) can be applied even if an item has the maximum number of properties already.\n- An item being a masterwork item no longer counts against the maximum enchantment allowed number. (masterwork items are determined by tag ending in _mast)\n- Epic casters (> 20 levels) can now add 4 enhancements to an item rather than only 3. (The level check is against the crafter, not all party members.)\n\nSpecial thanks to Marc Allard for significant help testing these modifications.\n\n---------------","Rating":9.79,"Votes":45,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"394":{"Name":"3.5 Multiple Summonings","Author":"bartleby12804","Submitted":20091022,"Updated":20091023,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Module Types":"Other","Scope":"Small","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Nonexistent","Hack & Slash":"Nonexistent","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"1","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Summon up to 10 creatures at a time choosing from a gui listing 4 per spell level.

The peace is not to last, however, as you find yourself caught in between a clash of factions that is linked to your past.\n\n�VERY IMPORTANT NOTES�- YOU MUST READ THESE BEFORE PLAYING THE MODULE, PLEASE.\n\n-RACE/CLASS RESTRICTIONS: Your pc must be one of the THREE RACES allowed (HUMAN, HALF-ORC OR FIRE GENASI) and no other, there is no hardcoded restriction, but the game will not make sense otherwise. \n\nChoosing a Human will make you a Terrian Human.\n\nChoosing a Half-Orc will make you a HALF-GROTH in the world of Yewrun (Groth are hairy, aggressive humanoids that burrow beneath the desert sands. Half-Groth are persons whose ancestry is human and groth).\n\nChoosing a Planetouched, Fire Genasi will make you a REFHRITE in the world of Yewrun (Refhrites are touched by the God of Fire and Chaos, Refhrun.

Companions will disappear from their place in the game world once recruited. Companions can be switched and summoned at ANY time using the �Party Roster� sub-menu in the �Player Menu�. To bring up the �Player Menu� click the button called �Toggle Player Menu� in the bottom-left corner of your screen. It is next to the �Rest� button and is shaped like the NWN-eye logo.

Upon starting the game you have access to a chest and armoire full of items. Just choose the items you need for your pc, as none of it can be sold. Paying attention to the journal and conversation may be important and yield important clues.

If these characters are not directly involved in the main Storyline we don't give them a second thought. Yet, even the most minimal NPC requires a hour or more of the creators time to make and we don't reflect on that as much as we should. I plan to explore the depths for which Characters/NPCs can contribute to the player experience be it: good, unpleasant, bizarre, philosophical, disconcerting etc. For that I need your input!\n\nFor a Web Art I project I'm conducting at Metropolitan State College, I plan to build a digital city(changes overtime) where your character inputs will be the NPCs(non-player-characters) in this world. The NWN2 toolset will be used as the medium to construct this. This will be updated randomly over time until this city is crowded enough that it is no longer feasible to continue. So, send me whatever character you have either: your PC or a NPC you created or planned to create. \n\n\n\nPersonal Time Constraints:\n\nBear in mind my class ends in four weeks:\n-The first module update will be by next Sunday.\n-The following Update will be the following week.\n-Another update around Thanksgiving.\n-Last update will be by December 3rd.\n-Further updates we be more random, but will continue as long as both the:\nsubmissions continue and my patience holds out.\n\nNear Future:\n-A link to the blog is forthcoming. \n-Multiplayer world.\n\n\nContribute:\n\nWhat you can contribute at the present time: (Malleable)\n1.)Send either a .erf, .bic, or screenshot of your character\n\n(Highly Recommended: send your characters as .erf files). \n\nErf Process:\nIn the toolset this is done by: file-export-(grab character and/or conversation)-(export to wherever it convenient and email it to me.)\n\nFor Character Screenshots:\n(Screenshot Key,\n-Imageshack, or Photobucket are recommended in this case.)\n\n\nSend Here:\nSend your input to this Email Address:\nEmail: (user.npc.city.input@gmail.com)\n\nToo Large?:\nOn the off-chance your contribution is too large for the Email then zip it up with: winrar, 7zip or compresser program.\n\n(Optimal but recommended)\n-Include your own Conversations with your characters.\n-You can use whatever scripts(code) that already available in the NWN2 engine for your conversations and on your character's actions provided I don't have to input in any custom scripts(code).\n\n2.) Any character or NPC up to the Storm of Zehir expansion is allowed.\n\n3.) State what location within the city you want them to inhabit (See Locations)\n----They will be placed randomly in that location\n\n///////////////////////\nSubmission Example:\n\n1.)Character Name: Bob\n2.)Location: Tavern\n3.)Description: \"\"\n4.)

I won't filter any character/NPC that you sent to me. Mistakes will happen, and if so then please kindly point them out in a email.\n\nThis module has no particular theme.\n\n\n/////////\n(Disclaimer: For my own Sanity's sake and your own, once a character is inputted as a NPC I won't change it or take it out. Also I'm not liable for whatever experience you should have after exploring this module. Be warned, but have fun regardless.)\n\nComments and criticisms are welcome, but bear in mind that these are user inputs so be civil when you discuss them. Spelling and grammar on character submissions is not a concern, and in fact discouraged as NPCs are prime place for these mistakes to appear in the first place.\n\n//////////\n\nKeep your submissions to email!\nEmail: ( user.npc.city.input@gmail.com )\n\n\nGo Nuts!!!","Rating":8.75,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"401":{"Name":"Legend of the Dragon Isles","Author":"Elizabeth Lestrad","Submitted":20091125,"Updated":20100214,"Category":"Multiplayer (10+ Players)","Module Types":"Epic, Roleplay","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Epic","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Heavy","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"40","Gameplay Length":"60","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"WIP.

Will you be the one to stop him?\n\nSet in the Dalelands region of the Forgotten Realms, Trinity is a party-based, single-player, stand-alone adventure inspired by classic PnP gameplay. For levels 6 to 8, with up to 7 hours of playing time (or more!).\n\nThe story takes place in 1375 DR, in the same general period as the NWN2 official campaigns. It is partly inspired by Ed Greenwood�s PnP module called �Into the Forgotten Realms� (published in Dragon Magazine #85, 1985).\n\n\n============\nREQUIREMENTS\n============\n\n+NWN2 patched up to version 1.23\n+Mask of the Betrayer\n+NOT Required: Storm of Zehir\n\n\n============\nKEY FEATURES\n============\n\n+Story-driven adventure with role-playing focussed on making choices that matter and have an actual impact on gameplay and story.\n\n+Several possible endings, story-linked sidequests and encounters that do not always have to end in combat (but most CAN if you wish).\n\n+Suitable for characters of any race and class (level 6 to 8 recommended).\n\n+Up to 7+ hours of gameplay (some even took 12 hours, not counting pauses or reloads!).\n\n+Four companions, for a complete 5-member adventuring party. Each have their own personalities and motivations, and provide full-party situational banter throughout the module.\n\n+Tons of community-made and module-exclusive custom content, including creatures by Jonny Ree and tilesets by Robinson Workshop.\n\n+Non-standard soundtrack.\n\n+Varied skill checks with XP rewards, in and out of dialogue.\n\n+Realistic secret doors and hidden objects.\n\n+For hardcore players only: limited but flexible resting system.\n\n+Compatible with Kaedrin's PRC pack.\n\n+Text thoroughly spell checked.\n\n\n=========\nTHE STORY\n=========\n\nThe adventure in Trinity begins as you stand before the Lord of Shadowdale. Lord Falconhand, acting on behalf of the Dalelands Council, selected you to lead a party of adventurers on a mission to stop one would-be tyrant from succeeding where another one failed twenty years before. Setting off from the Twisted Tower of Shadowdale by the Ashaba river, you will be taken to a section of the old elven forest of Cormanthor near the ruins of fabled Myth Drannor. From there, you will plunge deep underground into one of the area�s abandoned schools of wizardry on a hunt for magic, and a chase for one man.\n\n\n==========================================\nIS THIS MOD FOR YOU?\nMORE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE DOWNLOADING\n==========================================\n\nI designed and developped Trinity in accordance with what was important to me. Before downloading, you should be aware of the following:\n\nNOT FEATURED in the mod:\n\n+Romances and companion influence system.\n\n+Set good and evil �paths�. All situations are handled individually and there are opportunities to be a �goodie-two-shoes� as much as a \"bastard/bitch�, and places in between.\n\n+Banter-style roleplaying/Flavor dialogue options: player dialogue options are instead focussed on making choices that matter, uncovering the story, lore, setting and quests, and gathering information. Most dialogue options have been kept deliberately terse to allow players to �voice� their characters themselves and streamline gameplay.\n\n+Alignment shifts.\n\n+Crafting.\n\n+Voiceovers.\n\n+Cultural, social, or historical speech. All dialogues are written in contemporary North-American English, while avoiding blatant anachronisms.\n\n+SoZ-style party conversations, overland map or \"permanent\" death.\n\n+Freeform �sandbox-style� gameplay.\n\nIN ADDITION:\n\n+The mod can feel \"story/lore/setting-heavy\" if you choose to read all the dialogue options that are presented to you (especially in the beginning).

The thing is, due to the varied nature of the universe, the level and location variance was nearly perfect. 6 new locations for Samarach and 6 new for the Sword Coast. There's new low level adventures and, yes, even an opponent more powerful than the final boss of SOZ(be ready to die). There's a good amount of content to be played around with, and I, with the support of the NWN2 modding community, hope you enjoy this addition as much as I do.\n\nNOTE:\nAll the new dungeons are visible at the start. You do not need to \"find\" them. This was a conscious decision so that long time players of SOZ would not need to scour the map. This could, possibly, be altered in future additions.\n\nINSTALLATION:\nIncluded within the project are individual instructions. Follow them to the letter--it's for your own good, really.

I highly doubt future problems will occur, but being careful is its own reward.\n\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\nWaypoints will sometimes not display their mapnotes immediately upon finding one of the new dungeons. Upon re-entering the overland map, however, it should appear.\n\nJournals entries for the new areas are not working. This is due to the transfer from individual projects to the whole.

It is based on the board game Zombie Town, but of course has that DnD element that makes it unique.\n\nPlayers begin with minimal equipment based on their class and they are thrown straight into the action without warning (yes, you will be stripped of ALL gear!). While the object of the game is to simply survive long enough to escape, the means are much more involved and vary depending on the players' style.\nThe town is small and laid out very simply (it is based more on function rather than realism). A graveyard sits right in the middle, while twelve buildings surround the town's boundary. Zombies will spawn at the graveyard every game-hour and they will spawn in greater numbers as more players join the fun and as time passes by. Additional undead creatures can spawn in some cases, but I won't spoil the surprise. ;)\nEach building has a specific function and can supply the players with an assortment of goodies. Supplies are generally purchased using Supply Tokens which can be acquired from loot chests and skeleton corpses. Each building also has a narrow point of entry, allowing the players to place barricades using Barricade Tokens to plug the gaps and keep the zombies out. Barricades can be upgraded using additional barricade tokens. Buildings and supply are not enough however, so the players may even summon survivors using Survivor Tokens. Survivors act as party members and can be equipped with whatever gear you happen to find or make for them.\n\nOnce you've bashed your way out of town, you must make your way to the safety of the fort via a dangerous forest path. At the end, you will be able to peacefully finalize your character so that they are ready for the next module.\n\nZombie Fest is a simple module, but the possible functions make for an interesting session. It is a great way of building new characters so that they are ready for higher-level adventures without that horrible sensation of using shortcut modules and cheats to get you there. As a result, it is recommended that you begin play with new level 1 characters. A good Zombie Fest session should last about 30 minutes, but could potentially go on for hours. It is designed with cooperative multiplayer in mind, but singleplayer and PvP are definitely interesting. \n\nI hope at least someone enjoys it; it's been in the making for over a year now.\n\nRegards, \n\n\nDisordah.\n\n----------\n\nUPDATES for v1.1:\n*Fixed the Magicians Workbench, should work as normal.\n\n*Increased the amount of ammo supplied by each building.\n\n*Increased the amount of ingredients supplied at the Alchemist.\n\n*Added many more items to the shop.\n\n*Increased the XP reward for fortifying buildings.\n\n*Decreased the HP of the town gates significantly.\n\n*Cleaned up some of the dialog.\n\n*Adjusted some minor cosmetics.\n\nUPDATES for v1.2:\n*Replaced 'Compound' bows and xbows with more authentic ranged weapons.\n\n*Replaced normal arrows and bolts with fire arrows and bolts.\n\n*Made the module more caster friendly by adding wands and other useful trinkets to the Alchemy loot boxes.\n\n*Fixed a bug were loot boxes were not spawning new loot each game-hour.\n\n*Cleaned up some more dialog.\n\nUPDATES for v1.3:\n\n*Tweaked the lamp shadows so they look a bit better.\n\n*Fixed the issue with fire arrows and bolts being unindentified.\n\n*Added some goodies for Monks in the store.\n\n----------\n\nLeave a comment if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.","Rating":8.25,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"408":{"Name":"Chapters 1+2+3 -  Planescape: The Shaper of  Dreams ","Author":"FFG ","Submitted":20100110,"Updated":20111015,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"City Adventure, Dramatic, Dungeon Adventure, Epic","Forum Thread":"Forum","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"01","Gameplay Length":"07","Categories":"Single Player ","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Translated by: Marcus and Stefan\nAdditional translators chapter 1: Colette and Karacan\nAdditional translators chapter 3: \nMartina and Rosie\n\nGeneral Information:\n�Planescape: The Shaper of Dreams� is the first part of a single-player campaign consisting of six chapters. The first three chapters take place near and in Waterdeep, whereas chapters 4-6 will take the player to several other planes of the multiverse, including the Abyss. This first part will keep you entertained for about four to eight hours and offers several side quests. We recommend you begin the game with a female human or half-elven character (level 1). You may also want to take a look at our readme file which features additional information and solutions to the quests if you get stuck somewhere. \nIn the first chapter we get to know our heroine, her story and the horrible nightmares she has to deal with. In fact, when the player meets her for the first time, she isn't a heroine yet. Therefore, a major part of this chapter is about her everyday life as a lady of the manor near the small city of Holst. The player will help her to find out about her hidden powers and to become a true heroine on her long way to the Abyss. At the end of chapter one - when she has passed her first tests - she will embark on her journey.\nAs we go along, several companions will join her in the chapters to come. The party will have to survive many adventures on their way which will lead them to Sigil and finally to the Abyss.\n\nChapter 1: The manor and the surroundings of the city of Holst\nChapter 2: The Greycloak Mountains\nChapter 3: Waterdeep - Looking for a way to the Outer Planes\nChapter 4: Sigil - The City of Doors\nChapter 5: The Abyss - Pazunia\nChapter 6: The Abyss � Azzagrat\nPlease feel free to use our internet forum (link: see below) if you have any questions or bug reports or simply wish to comment on our module.

Korman, her husband, finally, managed to free her and to have her body and soul restored. However, he had to pay a terrible price. In order to save his wife, Korman had agreed to a pact with a mighty demon prince and he had sworn to serve his new lord in the Abyss for the rest of his life. \nAfter her return from the Realm of Shadows, our heroine has changed as well. She is no longer the person she was before. Whenever she goes to sleep, she is haunted by dreadful nightmares and gradually she begins to understand that something is very wrong with her.\nThere is a violent contrast between her life as a lady of the manor, where she has to deal with the manor�s everyday problems, and the mysterious horrors she has to face in her dreams. Eventually, these changes inside her make her want to change the situation around her as well. She decides to save Korman from his life-long servitude in the Abyss.\nThus, she embarks on a perilous journey through the planes of the multiverse to find her husband and to face her unexpected destiny�\n\nCHAPTER 2: THE HIEROPHANT\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThe campaign Planescape: Shaper of Dreams consists of six parts. This second chapter is relatively short and more combat oriented than the first one. \nHer first companion will join our heroine as she travels to the Greycloak Mountains. There she hopes to find Erir, the mysterious elf she saw in her dream. He promised to tell her more about her hidden powers. Will she be able to find Erir and learn more about her gift? Or is it a curse? Let's find out...\n\nCHAPTER 3: The High Priestess \n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThe third part of this campaign takes our heroine and her companions to\nWaterdeep.

It contains a modified NWN2 combat system and fully custom creature AI.\n\nThe MOD is inspired by such semi turn-based games as Baldurs Gate I & II but also the Final Fantasy series and certainly the contemporary titles Dragon Age: Origins.\n\nRight now it consists of a module and overide which together contain the entire system. Once it's mostly finished these two files will be put into a hak for easy use by builders and players.\n\n========================== About the Turn based Combat System: ======================\n\nSydney Natale is waiting in the TbCS for challengers to defeat her. Are you the one?\n\nSydney Natale:\nLevel: 20\nCR: You can't beat her!\nKnown strategies: Summons as well as Necromancy are only a small part of her arsenal. Energy Immunity as well as various protective spells are always kept at the ready. \nOther info: Sydney has a Chain Contingency spell on her person at all times. It's accompanying spells vary but are usually high level protective abjurations.\n\nPlay Setting Advice: Play on D&D Hardcore for intended behavior (affects contingencies; those have several difficulty options)\n\nAssistance and ideas are appreciated!\n\n\"This\" is the TbCS Demo Beta version. Sydney is supposed to be a lethal opponent!\n\nIf Anyone has any nice spell strategies, give me a holler and I will incorporate them into the AI (new spells are fine too!)\n\n\n\n\n========================= UPDATES LOG: ===================================\n\n---30-12-2010\nCompanions now tested and working thanks to Dorateen. There are also some bug fixes. \n\n---24-12-2010\nHexed the last version, some last minute bugs got overlooked.\nThe new version positively has controllable companions. Known bugs have been removed. Several new spells have been added.\nAlso Summoning has been improved. Some Animate undead spells still need to be done but on the whole it's quite usable.\n\nSpells: Horizikauls Versatile Vibration, Arcane Bolts, Bigby's Helpful Hand, Shadow Spray, Baleful Polymorph, Absolute Immunity, Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magical Weapons, Dorateen's Dynamic Disguise, Sinsabur's Baleful Bolt, Beltyn's Burning Blood and finally --> Simulacrum! (controllable too!) \n\n---23-12-2010\nThe new version should be the smoothest yet. (hex!) Many bugs have been found and removed as well as features added. The Wish spell is finally working properly, although it still has a bug concerning summoning visuals.\n\nSoZ PC-like companions as well as normal companions should now be controllable in combat, whereas henchmen remain on autopilot.\n\nSeveral new spells and feats have been added and coded into the TLK file.\n\nModders beware, the files in the overide folder have been altered. I recommend deleting your old overide. \n\n\n\n============================ TbCS FEATURES: ========================\n\n\n-- Movement\nTurn based Combat System:\nEach creature has one action round per global combat turn. (free actions etc to be implemented)\n\nMovement is object as well as location based. Possible venues are identified through script and selected by the player or AI through conversation / script. It is a level playing field. (I am open to allowing PC's to choose where to move through clicking if you wish)\n\n-- Combat\nA functioning Cover system:\nCreatures can take cover behind placeables and receive an AC bonus (+2 currently). Ranged attacks will fail if there is no clear line of fire. (the arrows will miss or hit the obstacle instead)\n\nDangerous Ranged Combat:\nRanged weapons have been slightly altered. Any ranged attack with a Longbow or any type of crossbow now inflicts accrues maximum ranged bonuses. Target AC is very important in this system as well as flanking. Any creature with an AC over 31 is considered very resistant and accrues the least possible ranged damage boni for the attacker. A creature with an AC of only 10 or less will automaticaly accrue maximum boni for the attacker. Flanking attacks are more damaging while frontal attacks are less so.\n\nFlanking functionality:\nThe system detects attacks from the flanks (such as in Dragon Age: Origins for example) \nCurrently Melee attacks reduce the attackee's AC-Dodge Bonus by 5.\nRanged flanking attacks enhance the penetration damage as described in the \"Dangerous Ranged Combat\" paragraph above.\n\nCombat Poses & Styles:\nCombatants can adjust their pose as the situation demands, gaining various benefits and weaknesses.\n\nCombat Formations:\nTo be Implemented. Looking at Shield Wall, Phalanx, Back to Back etc.\n\nFleeing:\nCreatures can attempt to flee from combat creating distance between themselves and the enemy. Once enough distance is gained combat is concluded. Fleeing creatures run away and thus have their backs exposed to the enemy, this means flanking attacks are likely when you are fleeing. Be careful not to expose yourself to enemy ranged attacks! (implemented)\n\nCharge ability as per SRD:\nCharging gives a character a +2 bonus on Strength and attack but a -2 against AC. The attacker speeds up until he reaches the target. (implemented) I am still looking at potential damage for readied pikes and such weapons on charging creatures. Ideas are welcome!\n\n\n\n-- Spells and Magic\nSpell duration is adapted to the Turn based System through modification of Jaillax' spell system. Spells properly last on a creature for its given turns.\n\nParticipants in a Magical Circe cast spells as one adding half their caster level to circle leader. Only the circle leader actually casts spells. (very strong ones!)\n\nCustom Summoning:\nSummoning now works akin to D&D standard rules. The caster has a chance of summoning a normal creature or 1d3 lower level ones. There are alot of summonable creatures and there is a distinction between Druids, Shamans & rangers (Summon Nature) and everyone else. (Summon Monster)\n\nCasters can summon more than once (max 22 creatures currently)\n\nNew spells such as Wish, Contingency, Aganazar's Scorcher, Chain Contingency, Detect Magic, Spell Turning, Protection from Petrification, Melf's Minute Meteors, Non Detection, Goodberry, Limited Wish, Shambler, Detect Evil, Detect Good, Detect Chaos, Detect Law, Greater Mirror Image, Vocalize, Flame Sword, Spirit Hammer, Energy Blades, Phantom Blade, Mislead, Greater Spell Turning, Strength of the One, Horizikauls Versatile Vibration, Arcane Bolts, Bigby's Helpful Hand, Shadow Spray, Baleful Polymorph, Absolute Immunity, Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magical Weapons, Dorateen's Dynamic Disguise, Sinsabur's Baleful Bolt, Beltyn's Burning Blood, Simulacrum and Summon Nishruu. Scyring is still a work in progress.\n\nSpecial Reactionary Spell Combinations: \n-Grease will explode when hit with fire\n-Sleeping creatures are vulnerable to spells such as phantasms & more.\n\nThe TbCS uses the Advanced Custom Spellframework made by Jaillax and LadyDesire. (version 2.0) This means that all relevant scripts such as psionics, legendary weapons, magical staffs, artefact and much more are easily integrated. (Original can be found here: Link\n\nMagical Sneak attacks per Semi-SRD:\nAll ranged and touch attack spells can be used to sneak attack and act appropriately. Wizard-Rogue is very, very deadly!\n\nOn top of this the TbCS also allows for blood magic and shadow magic.\n-Blood magic casts spells at twice the Caster level but at a cost of the spellcaster's own Health points.\n-Shadow Magic slightly boosts all spells except the Evocation and Transmutation schools nor spells with the 'light' descriptor.\n\n-- Items\nWeapon Switching: Draw and sheath weapons depending on their order in your inventory. In combat there is no time to do a lengthy search of you backpack so you'll have to keep the items (weapons / shields) you plan on using in the front of your inventory. Maximum 5 equipable items with the possibility of switching to the originally equipped weapon as well.\n\nItem usage:\nWands and Potions are usable, included decrementing charges. (AI can use items as well)\n\nWhile not in combat weapons are sheathed and carried on back, belt or in a rucksack. Made possible by Silk's Character VFX Pack now included in the TbCS download. The Original can be found here: Link \n\nUnderhanded Dagger fights:\nInlcuded is the excelent addition of using daggers underhandedly. The Original can be found here: Link\n\n\n\n-- AI\nDeception & Disguises:\nCombat can be avoided in a variety of ways. The most obvious way is to go invisible or sneak past a potential adversary but for those not gifted with arcane talents or an affinity to the shadows there is also the ability to disguise oneself through uniforms as well as shapeshifting into small animals to avoid detection. (rats are a good example of creatures particulary suited to avoiding hostile guards)\n\ncustom scripted Creature AI to suit the turn based system and take advantage of its features. \n\nThe AI is dynamic and weight based meaning that it will value it's options according to the situational picture. If an enemy has spell resistances it will value dispelling or bypassing those far more than simply slinging spells for example. Potions and wands are used and valued as well as innate abilities. There are two dynamic AI's. Caster & Non-Caster thogh there is some overlap in abilities and programming. Non-Casters may still use magic, just not exclusively.\n\nDefault NWN2 AI uses the TbCS:\nNormal AI scripts adjusted to use the TbCS. The scripts are in the module. Once the TbCS custom AI is up to speed an overide version for the OC will be released.\n\n\n\n-- Other\nGrim NWN2 UI:\nIncluded is a darker version of the NWN standard UI, made possible by Wesley. Original can be found here: Link\n\nMore Skins:\nAdditional creature skins from the vault, made possible by Derek_H & PNJ. Original can be found here: Link\n\nApep's magical Miscelaneous & itemsets from Link\n\nThe Fred's wonderfull Health Bar!\n\nSeveral other things I've probably forgotten to mention here, kudos!\n\n\nInstallation of the TbCS:\n\n-Overide files in overide folder\n-D&D.TLK in tlk directory\n-Com_mod.mod in modules folder\n-Ui files in ui folder\n\nFor builders it is advised to copy blueprints, conversations and scripts from the com_mod module into their campaign folders or into a seperate folder within the overide folder. \nThis will ensure you can still update everything easily, neatly.\n\n\n","Rating":9.9,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"418":{"Name":"Lowena","Author":"Jezla9","Submitted":20100318,"Updated":20110509,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dramatic, Mountain Adventure","Scope":"Small","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Light","Min Character Level":"05","Max Character Level":"06","Gameplay Length":"01","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Update 5/9/11: v1.19 - Fixed conversation bug; corrected more spelling/writing errors.\nUpdate 5/2/10: v1.16 - Added a starter area and basic equipment for new characters.

Not much is known in public about that organization, rumor has it that it is run by an old ferocious black dragon who employs the skills of a number of agents to further the company's interests. At least the payments seem to be handsome. With anticipation you eagerly await the job interview...\n\nLittle do you know about the adventure awaiting you.... \n\nDilating dimensions is a huge story-driven single player module that might appeal to everyone with a taste for black humor and an interesting storyline with many unexpected turns, difficult battles, unusual items and charismatic characters.\n\nLength: approx. 6 hours\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe module is designed for a new level 1 male character, melee classes might have a considerable advantage in the battles (especially the exotic weapon feat might be handy). Playing it with a female character is a very bad idea, since the conversations were written for a male one.\nThe alignment should not matter at all and will not be modified in the game. You will also find some items in the game that might help you to fight with a refined strategy instead of using brute force. For some quests there are also often various ways to accomplish an objective, though the design is linear to some extent. Quests don't have to be done in a particular order, but they are usually connected to the storyline and should be completed before the next major development of the plot. There are more battles than in the two other parts of the series, but none of the encounters or bossfights should be particularly difficult.\n\nCONVERSATIONS:\nConversations play an important role in this mod and you will meet many NPCs to converse with. Usually the conversations are rather straightforward and do not offer an abundance of options. I did not include any skillchecks or conditions that depend on the player's class or race, since I believe it's more fun that way. Sometimes your companions might want to say a line or two, so keep them close.\n\nCOMPANIONS/HENCHMEN\nIn the game you will encounter two characters who can be added to your party. One will join you at the beginning, she is one of the series' major characters and you will need her to complete the game. Later you can also recruit another NPC for some time. You will get a special item to resurrect them when they die. \n\nITEMS:\nYou will find plenty of magical items and armors in the game and enough of shops that buy them. Since most enemies drop their equipment you can easily get a lot of gold. If you don't know what to buy, spend it on healing potions. And after you've left the city, shopping will be more difficult with only one shop available. \n\nRESPAWNING:\nRespawning usually takes you back to a respawn point in the city and will not be sanctioned in any other way. After you've gone through the portal, respawning will not allow you to continue, so it's a good idea to save often. Note that there is one conversation after which you will always die. This is part of the storyline and can't be avoided.\nThat's all...\nHave fun\n\nIf you like the game, or not, or just want to tell me your opinion, feel free to drop me a line (You can also write me in German).\n(C) 2006-2010\nseinsvergessen@gmail.com","Rating":8.92,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"426":{"Name":"The Kitchen Boy Modules 6 and 7","Author":"PGB","Submitted":20100419,"Updated":20110630,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Epic","Scope":"Epic","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"10","Max Character Level":"11","Gameplay Length":"07","Categories":"Deleted","Patch":"1.01","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Deleted","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"427":{"Name":"The Kitchen Boy Module 5","Author":"PGB","Submitted":20100419,"Updated":20110630,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Epic","Scope":"Epic","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"08","Max Character Level":"08","Gameplay Length":"07","Patch":"1.01","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Deleted","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"428":{"Name":"The Kitchen Boy Module 4","Author":"PGB","Submitted":20100419,"Updated":20110630,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Epic","Scope":"Epic","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"06","Max Character Level":"07","Gameplay Length":"07","Categories":"Part of a series","Patch":"1.01","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Deleted\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"429":{"Name":"The Kitchen Boy Module 3","Author":"PGB","Submitted":20100419,"Updated":20110630,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Epic","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"04","Max Character Level":"05","Gameplay Length":"05","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Deleted\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"430":{"Name":"The Kitchen Boy Module 2","Author":"PGB","Submitted":20100419,"Updated":20110630,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Epic","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"03","Max Character Level":"04","Gameplay Length":"04","Patch":"1.01","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Deleted","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"431":{"Name":"The Kitchen Boy Module 1","Author":"PGB","Submitted":20100419,"Updated":20110630,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Epic","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"01","Gameplay Length":"07","Patch":"1.01","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Deleted\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"432":{"Name":"The Sinister Series Part II of III - Hail To The King","Author":"Cincinnatus C","Submitted":20100508,"Updated":20100618,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dramatic, Humorous/Parody, Roleplay, Romance","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Heavy","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"14","Max Character Level":"16","Gameplay Length":"08","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"The Sinister Series Part II of III - Hail To The King 2.0\n\n---\n\nDisappointed with your performance on your first mission your boss sent you on an obviously simple assignment which gradually spiraled out of control (again)...\n\n\n\nIn a desperate attempt to conquer some of the market of the Elven Empire, a repressive monarchy with a pervasive military aspect, your company has opened a shop in one of the Empire's bigger cities where all of your competitors are owned by the state. In order to survive your company needs all information on the economic policies of the regime it can get.\n\nWhat at first seems to be a simple search for information soon turns out to be a matter of life and death. You are caught in the middle of an insane struggle for power in a world full of intrigues and quickly end up as a direct enemy of the state. Will you be able to get your head out of the sling or will you only get deeper entangled in a net of inevitable chaos and bureaucratic bungling?\n\n\n\nHail to the King is an immersive single-player module with an emphasis on roleplaying. You will interact with a huge variety of colorful NPC characters, face a chimerical trial about your own execution (Connoisseurs of classical fiction will certainly notice a tinge of Kafka in it), lead an army into a battle of epic dimensions, encounter charismatic villains and rabid butterflies, discover a compelling storyline, and develop a relationship with you henchmen.\n\n\n\nLength: approx. 6 hours\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThis mod is designed for a character around level 14. This will be the approximate level of your character if you've completed 'Dilating Dimensions', but you can also play it if you haven't played Part I without missing anything important. Basically it should be playable with all classes, though melee classes might have a slight advantage in battle.\n\nThe mod is intended for a male character, (Nothing will stop you from choosing a female one, although you will have to live with the fact that some dialogs will seem quite out of place if you decide to play it with a female protagonist.) Alignment doesn't matter and won't be modified. Conversations are more refined than in Part I and you will often have to talk to a NPC several times. The epic battle at the end between two armies might get a little choppy if you are playing on a slow machine.\n\n\n\nCONVERSATIONS:\n\nExpect lengthy conversations with all sorts of colorful characters. Conversations are an important emphasis of this module and I wanted to create them as realistic as possible. Each of the major characters has an unique personality that should be reflected in the conversations. Your companions will also be involved in many dialogs and say a few things, or let you know they want to talk. All conversations (more than 50) together have the length of a book, so this is probably not the mod for you if you prefer to skip dialogs or rush through them. Again, there are no skill checks in the conversations and your options don't depend on your character.\n\n\n\nCOMPANIONS:\n\nApart from two characters that should be familiar from Part I, you can recruit a third companion. All three can be fully controlled and play an important role for the development of the plot. You don't have to take all three of them into your party, but it's highly recommended. You will have an item in your inventory to resurrect them when they die. There's also a simple romance option for the two female companions.\n\n\n\nITEMS:\n\nYou will find a couple of stores available throughout the game. Most enemies drop their equipment, which can be sold for a good price. Some items from Part I won't function in Hail To The King, I removed the Gauntlet of Greater Doom since I found it too overpowered and ridiculous. There's also a place where you can upgrade weapons.\n\n\n\nRESPAWNING:\n\nThere is a respawn point in each of the major cities. Respawning will result in a loss of XP and gold. You will always be able to respawn, except in the final battle.\n\n\n\nSome parts of the story might seem a little gloomy, but this is still largely a humorous module following the style of my first mod.\n\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n(C) 2008-2010\n\nseinsvergessen@gmail.com\n\n\n\nPlease vote if you like my mod, I'd love to hear from you.\n\n\n\nP.S.:The Empire is no allusion to any real or historical regime, regard it as a general metaphor on the use and abuse of power.\n\n","Rating":8.93,"Votes":9,"Awards":[]},"433":{"Name":"The Sinister Series Part III of III - On the Heights of Despair","Author":"Cincinnatus C","Submitted":20100516,"Updated":20130112,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dramatic, Horror/Survival Horror, Humorous/Parody, Roleplay, Romance, Twisted / Dark","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Heavy","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"14","Max Character Level":"17","Gameplay Length":"07","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"The Sinister Series Part III of III - On the Heights of Despair\n\nFor an endless time you have been locked up in a prison cell for a crime you haven't committed. So when a mysterious stranger opens the door to your cell and tells you that she has come to liberate you, you naturally hope for the best. Little do you know of her plans for you... What could be on the other side of the portal she leads you to? Are you prepared for a nightmare exceeding the limits of your imagination?\n\nWill you find your way in a desolate and empty dimension so much unlike your own? Explore the ruins of an ancient civilization and discover the reasons for its downfall. Meet unexpected allies and an unbelievably evil and deranged artificial intelligence. Will your actions result in your freedom or will you even cause more suffering? Or will you be only tormented for eternity?\n\nAfter all, On the Heights of Despair is a little experiment with a well-developed narrative and lengthy dialogs.\nThis mod is probably not the right thing for the faint of heart, but it might appeal to you if you love a complex narrative with emotional depth, long dialogs with realistic characters (each of the major characters has his own personality) and a futuristic setting.\n\nWhat makes this mod experimental is that I tried to create a futuristic scenario. It was not easy to create areas that could be the credible remains of a technologically advanced civilization, since 95% of the game's resources have a distinctly medieval touch.\nNote that not all action takes place in a futuristic setting, you will also travel back to areas and encounter NPCs you might remember from the previous two missions.\n\nLength: approx. 6 hours\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nA character around level 15 is recommended. A male character is highly recommended since the conversations do not support a female protagonist. Most encounters shouldn't be too difficult if you put the different talents of your companions to good use.\n\nCONVERSATIONS:\nConversations are usually long and focused on the main characters. \nI wanted to create them as realistic as possible. Each of the major characters has an unique personality that should be reflected in the conversations. Your companions will also be involved in many dialogs and say a few things, or let you know they want to talk. There are fewer NPCs than in Part II, so conversations are centered on the main characters. Again, there are no skill checks in the conversations and your options don't depend on your character.\n\nCOMPANIONS:\nYou will encounter two new companions and a familiar character from the first two parts. The game should be played with all of them and it is not intended that you recruit only one or two. Each of them can be fully controlled. Their different classes and talents should be quite helpful in most battles. \n\nITEMS:\nOnly very few shops exist in the game which can only be accessed at certain points and you won't find an abundance of magical armors and items to sell. \n\nRESPAWNING:\nRespawning allows you to continue instantly at the point where you died, but you will pay a heavy penalty in gold and XP. The game can be completed without respawning, so try to avoid it since it will weaken your character considerably.\n\nYour comments are always welcome (you can also write me in German). And please vote if you like this mod.\n\nThat's all, have fun!\n(C) 2009-2010\nseinsvergessen@gmail.com","Rating":8.88,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"434":{"Name":"A Dark and Stormy Night","Author":"Kryton213","Submitted":20100518,"Updated":20120728,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dungeon Adventure, Epic, Forest Adventure, Mountain Adventure, Roleplay, Various Settings","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Dependant on Module","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"03","Gameplay Length":"02","Categories":"NWN2 SP Campaigns\nSingle player mods","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Description: Title :: A Dark and Stormy Night\nMod :: P9-A1\nVersion :: 1.05.0\nFor LVs :: 1-3 (New PC's)\nGame play :: about 1-2 hours\n\n\nDaSN\n==============\nNeverwinter Nights 2: A Dark and Stormy Night\n\nA Project 9 Campaign\nThis mod is the first part of a series. \n\n\nA While back ago your parents were killed by an attack on the village. \nTenzin, a high monk has agreed to take can of you until you were able to\ndo so on your own.

The others are:\n\nSheep and Stone.\nThe Caravan Club.\nThe last days of the Raven.\nThese Dark Days of Waiting.\nFrom This Comes Strength.\n\nThe series will be six modules in length, the fifth of which is work in progress. All will appear under the \n\ncampaign title of Tales from the Lake of Sorrows, late in 2012.\n\nPlease enjoy the modules and don't forget to vote :)\n\nThe Caravan Club.\n\nAfter two weeks of kicking your heels in the Masons Rest Inn, Ormin the Cleric finally has some work for you. A farmer and his family, missing, presumed dead, a wayward Mielikki priest, missing, presumed drunk. Both require locating, and you are the person for the job. \n\nShould be simple enough?\n\nBut life for you has been anything but simple over the last few weeks and it's not about to change now. \n\nTwo murders committed miles apart but somehow connected, the evil Samuel still at large and out for vengeance and the little matter of some unfinished business with the smugglers you put down. Your investigations take you from your comfortable room in Lakeside to the fortified Waggoners Inn, through a vast cave system and to the city of splendours itself. What starts as simple quests quickly becomes a dangerous game of cat and mouse with the most challenging enemy you will ever have to face, a superior adventuring party.\n\n******************\n\nThis is the second module in what will become a series under the title Tales from the Lake of Sorrows. The Caravan Club takes place two weeks on from my first module, Sheep and Stone picking up the story where where the first module leaves off. It can however, be played as a stand alone. It will take your character from level 3.5 to around 5.5. It also develops the plot lines which will be the backbone of the third mod in the series, which I hope will be completed by early 2011.\n\nThis is a linear story led mod, there are some side quests and conversations which boost your exp but this is not a sandbox mod by any means.\n\n=======================\nLoading instructions.\n=======================\n\nYou should have:\n\nOne folder titled The_Caravan_Club\nTwo hak files\nseven sound files (in the override folder)\n\nTo install.\n\nPut/copy the *.hak files to you hak folder.\nCopy the sounds files out of the folder I sent them in and place them in your over ride folder.\nCopy the module file The Caravan Club to your modules folder.\n\nThe module will now run from your modules start up screen. \n\n========================\nThings you should know:\n========================\n\nThe mod should be fine for any class though magic users may need the respawn button in the earlier combats. There are no race restrictions but Humans are the order of the day. You can start at any level, there is a little intro section that will take your character to around level 3.5 unless you are higher than this. New characters, and to some extent, less new characters get some money to spend in town. Also in the chest in the bedroom I have placed 1000 gp and a dagger. This is there to reflect your time spent in Sheep and Stone. I expect you to reach around 14000 exp by the end.\n\nYour facilitators are Ormin and Isla (in the first third of the mod). If you find yourself not sure what to do and the journal does not help then you probably need to be talking to Ormin. \n\nTransition are made without a world map. In each outdoor area you will find either a stone, a sign or an area transition that will get you out. For indoor areas, that are not big caves, use the door like everybody else.\n\nYour npc's are Ember and Solace. Solace is optional after the first main quest is complete however, if you don't have a fighter type class I suggest you keep her with you. If you do drop her you can pick her up in the Waggoners as long as you have sufficient influence with her. Once you have done this she is with you till the end. You should be aware that you need to treat her at least moderately well to have her stay with you. Look at the pop up text for clues on what she finds acceptable and what she dislikes.\n\nYou will know how well you are treating the npc's by the way they talk to you. The less well you treat then the less you will get out of them.\n\nThe npc's both have back stories which you can access if you have a good enough relationship with them.\n\n=====\nTime.\n=====\n\nThis mod is very time based. Shops shut at night and certain npc's are not available at certain times. Resting is restricted. You have a room; in this you may rest and pass 8 hours. Many transition points allow you to jump to this directly. All of the innkeepers will allow you to pass up to 4 hours without resting so you should never be stuck waiting. Note however, at night most, if not all, npc's go to one of the inns. If they are not there then they are not plot movers. While the general rule is shops close at night you can always buy potions from Melissa and when you are in desperate need the shops will open. \n\n==================\nWhat the mod has:\n==================\n\nThis is a linear story driven module. There are side quests but limited possibilities for sandbox style play. That said there are places to explore with rewards for doing so. Talk to everyone at different times of the day, there are hidden exp rewards with some of the characters. Hint � Talk to Melissa, while she is studying during dinner, for a chance to use craft alchemy.\n\nThe module has a good degree of npc interaction and the npc's have back stories which will be revealed as the mod plays out.\n\n============================\nWhat this mod does not have:\n============================\n\nSoZ style conversations.\nFlexible npc hiring and firing.\nA romance � however you can develop the relationship with Ember and there are rewards associated with that.\n\n===============\nBig thanks bit:\n===============\n\nThanks go to the following for their parts in the making and testing of the mod.\n\nUncle FB- for the Uncle FB's NPC control.\nLilac soul- for the script generator � all other scripts were written using this.\nJet Truebow- for his play testing input.\nciViLiSed- for his play testing and comments.\nSGK73- for the black skydome Hak.\nGordon Gregory- for his playing of Grien Sluis. This is a piece of Lute music written around 1550 credited to John Dowland, it is a variation on Greensleeves. Gordon plays both the treble and the ground in this piece. (A WORD OF WARNING; I have permission to use this piece not you lot! If he catches you with it his people will come for you in the night and turn you into a frog � probably.)\nJhonen Olains Eberron journal elven translator provided the Elven Language used by Min and others.\nFinally thanks to the forum users who helped me with all the techie bits which I cant do, which frankly is all the techie bits.\n\nI hope you enjoy The Caravan Club and hope also than you can find time to vote and comment.\n\nThanks and enjoy,\n\nPJ\n\n=====\nHint\n=====\n\nIf at some point you find yourself in a big cave and it's a long way to get out.\n\n1.Move to where you can look down on some mushrooms and click there to move to them.\n2.Your character will cross a river on the way, stop there. Look down the line of the river and click as far up stream as the cursor will lets you (past the second waterfall).\n3.When you arrive there you will see the entrance you can click there and travel the rest of the way. If you don't have the dexterity use the side entrance.\n\n=====================================\n Version 1.1\n=====================================\n\nIn this version I have fixed or responded to pretty much every comment that has come up to date, and a few that I have seen or found off line.\n\n1. I have moved some journal triggers and keys to ensure the flow of the module is not easily stalled.\n2. I have changed the CR so creatures appear as tough as they are - You know when to fight and when to run,\n3. I have fixed a few convo probelms with barkstrings appearing as cutscenes.\n4. Some Typo's have been fixed.\n5. I have extended some convo's so that npc's respond appropriatly to a mid game event.\n6. I have balanced the fighting so that the ride is not so difficult if you choose not to take Solace I still strongly advise that non combat classes take Solace along","Rating":9.29,"Votes":59,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"436":{"Name":"16 Cygni 1","Author":"Claudius33","Submitted":20100524,"Updated":20120406,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Epic, Roleplay","Scope":"Large","Content":"Adult","Tricks & Traps":"Dependant on Module","Roleplay":"Heavy","Hack & Slash":"Dependant on Module","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"03","Gameplay Length":"16","Categories":"\tSingle Player story driven campaign, a blend of Sci Fi and heroic fantasy.

It is a blend of Sci Fi and heroic fantasy. Expect even more surprises in the 2nd part ...\n\nThe player chooses the language at the very beginning of the first conversation.\n\nAs 16 Cygni I is currently very well rated, I have been advised to submit it as an English module too. The translation has been rated fair and even well done. \n\nBy the author of the also appreciated campaign \"A Slave Destiny\" (French only, quests log and walkthrough available in English).\n\nImportant : The campaign has been designed with MotB and SoZ installed.\n\n\nWARNING : Adult Content. Patch level 1.23.\n\nYoung Lieutenant Junior Grade, you are a new crew member of the Epsilon Eridiani, a frigate class exploration ship, heading toward the 16 Cygni triple star system, about 70 light years from the Solar system. State of the Art vessel, the Epsilon Eridani is one of the first ship of the Fleet manned by a multi racial crew. As a matter of fact the ship belongs to the Orion's Arm Fleet, an organisation which groups different races living relatively close to the Solar system on the Milky Way's spiral arm named Orion's Arm. Around 16 Cygni B, one of the two Sun like yellow dwarves of the system 16 Cygni, orbits a giant planet, 16 Cygni Bb. One of the 16 Cygni Bb moons, of the size of the Earth, might have got an atmosphere and water, hence might support life..\n\nSome of the 16 Cygni features :\n\n* Influence system : Contrary to NWN2, the influence modifications are not displayed. You will get a status from time to time.\n\n* You will be given the opportunity to choose the class and the race of your first companion among a wide range of choices! Contrary to SoZ, your teammate will get a personality. It is initialised at creation time, sometimes randomly depending on the class and the race combination. You will get a more limited choice for the other companions in order to fit the story, with sometimes a slight random distortion. Choose wisely your first companion as s/he will be with you almost all the time. You will be granted a backup opportunity before choosing.\n\n* Social skills : Except for specific cases, the highest level of all the party members is automatically taken into account. So your barbarian going along with a pretty bard will automatically become a skilled diplomat ...\n\n* Crafting : Again the highest skill level of the party is taken into account. Just try to combine two objects in a workshop. Learn from the inhabitants or experiment by yourself. Armor creation is less used in the first part, however ... Magic objects creation is not used.\n\n* Romances, infiltration quests and bonuses of XP based on performance.\n\n* Debug scripts included, to quiclky help a player running into a blocking situation. So far only one known situation which might affect a low percentage of players, read here in case : Link\n\nMore details and installation instructions in the presentation file.\n*NEW* Journal's improved English translation by She-Wolf (Dec 4, 2011)\n*NEW* Update 1.04 (Nov 1, 2011)\n* Companions can be multi classed now.\n* Your teammate alignment is now randomised.\n* English translation revision by ralebeau (Huge thanks to him)\n* Several minor bugs corrected.\n* Campaign folder is now totally compatible for all 3 Parts. It the same for all Parts.\nTo totally benefit from the new version, please reinstall the campagne folder et the modules archives of each 3 Parts.\n\nUpdate 1.01 (Sept 12th, 2010)\n* Fixed the bug in the Ondolisse Morne which prevented a convo to fire, had the player read the riddle before using the control box.\n* Fixed blueprints : it is now possible to choose a gray orc medic as your teammate.\n* Reduced likelihood of convo not firing, safeties added (finding of a clue in Canas Eryn, painting in Tinwerontar, examination at the Narag-zaram...)\n* Quest log now includes 16 Cygni 2 quests.\n* Quest log more clearly states the end of the Part 1.\n* Gaining influence with a neutral teammate made less difficult. Activated from your current position.\n* Some typos corrections.\n* The special file to start the campaign without MoTB is no more needed. However it is very unlikely that the campaign could be played without MoTB. Without SoZ, I don't know.\n\nStuck in the mod?

Since most creatures in the further out areas now scale up to the player character, I felt there is no need to reset the characters level to 1 anymore for balance. Although the first bunch of quests may be far too easy if played with anything other than a level 1 to 2 party. I'll leave that for the players to decide.\n\n2. You can now gain XP for disarming all traps and successfully picking all locks.\n\n\n3. A new area has been added, Shivertimber Cave in the Gull Coast SE.\n\n\n4. Halved all of the quest XP, except for the first quests.\n\n\nWulverheim Demo Update version 1.4: \n\n1. Most hostile creatures should no longer spawn unless the PC is more than 30 meters away. This of course may differ in small areas. This should prevent spawn camping, ambushes on the PC and being effected by the instant respawn bug.\n\n2. Guardsmen conversations are more useful. They provide general information, skill training and will arrest convicted thieves as well as murderers. \n\n3. Made the Silver Daggers 'Bounty items' for weightlessness. \n\n4. There are now NPC's scattered around Wulverheim that provide training services. They temporarily boost your characters skills for a price. \n\n5. With except of normal animals, most NPC's will scale to the PC when they spawn. They will level up to the Player Characters and have appropriate enhancements/AC bonuses applied to their equipment. Only problem is CR cannot be set correctly. However I have added an alternative XP reward system that rewards 4XP for every on damaged dealt. I have removed the CR on all creatures, as this will not apply anymore. All creatures will say they are effortless when examined, however this is rarely true, so ignore that.\n6. Created Thief criminal record system for when players are caught pickpocketing an NPC. \n\n7. Beggars are now pottering around the streets. You can be kind to them or be mean.\n\n8. There is now a more detailed hint in Vestar's Maze to help players understand how the combination lever puzzle works.\n\n\nWulverheim Demo Update version 1.3: \n\n1. Fixed a problem with the AI heartbeat functions that were happening during conversations and combat. For example NPC's will no longer sit in mid air during a conversation or walk away from a fight for no apparent reason.\n\n2. Since Vestar's Maze is virtually impossible to get through using the Character Mode, I have added another tip at the beginning regarding the use of Exploration mode and useful camera controls for those who don't know, to help them get through it easier. \n\n\nWulverheim Demo Update version 1.2: \n\n1. Added a new universal treasure key that opens any locked chest. These will only be dropped by bosses and can only be used once per key found. \n\n2. Lowered the overall open lock DC's on loot containers and made more of a range of different DC's.\n\n3. Equipped mercenaries with only basic gear and created scripts to apply and scale AC and Enhancement bonuses to it depending on your character level. This should make them more effective across all levels.\n\n4. If a mercenary forgets to equip their shield after using a ranged weapon, then talk to them to tell them to use melee and they will re-equip their shield.\n\n5. Placed the bosses on spawn triggers, so that they don't respawn with all the other NPCs. This should reduce overwhelming spawn situations when you have only just killed a boss once.\n\n6. Made essential doors un-trappable by the random trap generator.\n\n7. Vestar's Maze: Extended the auto close time on one of the doors that was likely to separate party members. \n\n8. Made a criminal record system for when you kill a hostile guard while trespassing. This will effect what happens when you speak to certain characters, especially guards and sovereign rulers who will attempt to arrest you. You can either pay the fine or serve your time, which means you lose XP and get teleported to an unlocked jail. \n\n\nWulverheim Demo Update version 1.1: \n\n1. When importing pre-configured characters, they should be reduced to level 1 without the default package being applied.\n\n2. Added clues to Vestar's Maze.\n\n3. The statue no longer references PW Action server category.

It is intended for Wizards. It is possible for a Sorcerer or a Bard to finish the module, but it may be necessary to start at a level higher than first due to the difficulty of combat. Other classes are strongly discouraged as they will not be able to complete the module. If you choose to multi-class it will likely make the module more difficult, but if you take at least one level in the aforementioned spellcasting classes, it will be possible, although very difficult, to finish the module.\n\nAny of the races will fit well with the plot. Due to the difficulty of combat, if you choose a race with a level adjustment you may not be able to complete the module. \n\n\nConversations and journal entries will guide you as you proceed through the game. While there is a central plot, There are several side quests which you can complete at your leisure. Some are more difficult than others. If you are not powerful enough to complete a particular quest, I recommend you leave it be and return when you have reached a higher level.\n\nYou must proceed with caution in The Wizard's Apprentice or you will die. A lot. Keep your defensive spells at the ready and save frequently as there is no respawning. Explore all areas thoroughly and talk to everyone to complete quests and learn more about your surroundings. There are ample items, potions, scrolls, and other things to assist you. They are there for a reason, to keep you alive.\n\nThis module is the first in a series. Questions are raised which will not be answered in this module. You will receive items which do not appear to be immediately useful.\n\nThe sequel can be found here:\n\nThe Wizard's Apprentice Chapter II\n\n_______________________\nInstallation instructions:\n\nYou must have both Mask of the Betrayer (XP1) and Storm of Zehir (XP2) installed in order to play this module. \n\n1) Place the .mod file entitled \"TWA Prologue\" in the \"modules\" folder in the Neverwinter Nights 2\nfolder in your \"My Documents\" folder.\n\n2) Place the folder entitled \"The Wizard's Apprentice\" in the \"campaigns\" folder in the Neverwinter Nights 2 folder in your \"My Documents\" folder.\n\n3) Look in the folder titled \"The Wizard's Apprentice\" and copy the file \"giant_ant.hak\" into your hak folder which is found in the Neverwinter Nights 2 folder in your \"My Documents\" folder. \n\n***IMPORTANT NOTE****\nIt has been brought to my attention that the ending cutscene of the game will occasionally not play. If you get to what seems like the end of the game, but don't get a cutscene that tells you that you are finished, then reload your last save and do it again and it should work the next time. I am working on releasing version 1.2 which will contain the fix.

The gameworld, or sandbox, is theirs to uncover as they wish. The aim of this was not to create a epic adventure with a tightly woven character centric plot, so please bear that in mind before and during play. The game is intended to provide a framework for sandbox adventuring, albeit with more environment interactivity through skill use.\n \nWhat is a 'treasure hunt' sandbox?\n'Treasure hunt sandbox' is a term I've coined for LoWPM to reflect the fact that whilst the gameworld is a non-linear sandbox that players can explore in any order they wish, within that sandbox there is a 'hidden treasure', to which the players are given a 'map' or plot hook at the start. But how the players use this knowledge, if at all, is up to them. The idea is that a single player, or group in multiplay, can choose to explore the sandbox for as much time as they want, or dive straight into the hidden core plot.\n \nSo what is this 'hidden treasure'?\nIn LoWPM, the hidden treasure is White Plume Mountain itself, and the more linear plot-driven dungeon crawl that lies therein. This set of adventures are based on the original D&D modules of S2: White Plume Mountain (by Lawrence Schick, 1979, and revised for 3rd edition in 2005 by Andy Collins, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, and James Wyatt), Return to White Plume Mountain (by Bruce Cordell, released in 1999 to mark D&D's 25th anniversary), and Ex Keraptis Cum Amore, a final White Plume Mountain adventure in the series (published in Dungeon 77, 1999, by Andy Miller).\n \nWhere is the campaign set?\nOriginally, White Plume Mountain was set in the Greyhawk universe, but to reflect the NWN2 toolset, I have revised this to reflect a Forgotten Realms setting, and reimagined the plot to tie in with FR lore. The sandbox that the players can explore is covered by the High Moor and Serpent Hills in the Western Heartlands region of Faerun. The players will start in Soubar, a small tent city nestled in the Serpent Hills. This will also act as a place to stock up on equipment between forays into the region.\n \nWhat does the campaign offer?\nMy take on SoZ style play; exploration, an overland map, party dynamics, skill checks, crafting (OC and SoZ style), a wide range of locations and enemies. Resting restrictions. Multiplayer compatibility. A tour-de-force of the community custom content. Drop-in, drop-out gameplay allows you to tackle as much or as little as your time allows in a simple modular fashion, within a total gameplay time of over 15 hours. Challenges for parties of levels 7 to 16+.\n \nWhat does the campaign NOT offer?\nStrong story driven adventure, developed romancable influencable companions, PC-driven plot with cinematic cutscenes and lots of dialogue. Alignment can be altered in game but has little bearing and there is no alignment based roleplaying. No Voiceovers. Player class/race will have no story impact. No Pickpocket/Sleight of Hand use (this may change).\n \n \n \nIs there anything else I need to know?\n- SAVE EARLY AND SAVE OFTEN. It can't be said enough\n- LoWPM was designed with a party of 4 7-th level PCs in mind. I suggest using a character builder mod to select suitable PCs. Additional party members up to a total of 6 can be introduced using the inn guestbook in Soubar (the starting area) or by using the party editor from the menu at any time during play. New characters created in / entering Soubar will gain xp for 7th level (but you may need to use the debug tool to give them starting gold). In the party editor, there is the option to increase your party size by up to 6. Custom NPCs are also offered at the inn guestbook in Soubar.\n- THERE ARE RUST MONSTERS - PROTECT YOUR WEAPONS AND ARMOUR! Note however, that they only make an appearance in one area out of nearly 100, so losing precious items is not an ever present risk\n- SoZ death/bleeding system is used\n- Skill checks have use in dialogues but also to add flavour when exploring. Spot, Survival, Lore, Listen in approximate order of use. Other skills are used but for less common scenarios, particularly when a skill already has a developed use in other situations e.g. crafting, tumble etc. Race and class may effect the skill check result. An XP award is given to the specific character who passes the check, not to the whole party - 'scouts' may benefit more from this.\n- Searching will reveal hidden doors and items. Search checks are automatic (no need for search mode to be on), but if Search Mode is turned on, there is a bonus to the check. An XP award is given to the character who passes the search check.\n- XP is awarded for disarming traps and unlocking objects. \n- Tracking will provide clues to the monsters that inhabit the terrain. XP is awarded to the character uncovering this information.\n- You can create your own party (at inn, or via player menu), use pregenerated companions (guest stars form the Dark Avenger series, with some but little dialogue). Some henchmen are available, but only for specific sidequests.\n- Rangers should find most favoured enemies accounted for. Undead, humans, yuan-ti and gnomes are probably slightly over-represented.\n- Most enemies you combat are neutral/evil, and only very few are good. Blackguards/smiters of good take note. \n- Tithe boxes are provided at the start to allow the PC to convert gold into useful items whilst dungeoneering, and also as a mechanism to handle any alignment shifts that may be desired/required.\n- Support for Kaedrin's PrC work - but you must download the alternative hak for this to be compatible. NOTE TO KAEDRIN PRC USERS - you should delete the sub folder named 'SoZ' from the override version of Kaedrin's work to prevent bugs on the overland map.\n \n \n \nInstallation Instructions\n- Place contents of HAK in your Neverwinter Nights 2 hak directory under My Documents\n- Place contents of MODULES in your Neverwinter Nights 2 modules directory under My Documents\n- Place contents of CAMPAIGN in your Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign directory under My Documents\n \nSpecial Thanks to the NWN2 Custom Content Contributors without whom a project like this would not have been possible!\nTilesets\nRWS - Deep Chasms, Sewers, Deep Halls\nPrefab areas/lighting\nPhd_Zaius -Mine + Cave, Kal-ahn'dur\nKrusings - Roddenaughlye\nSGK - Underdark Bazaar, Ritual sites, Pestilent lands, Tombwatch pass, Dwarven Stronghold, Swamp paths, Plains, Quarry\nTiclaDesign - Snow Pass, Cavern Below\nMaerduin - Castle Joyous\nNagual_nwn - Drow city and temple, dragon cemetary\nGremlin - Sanctuary of Sacred Strife, Unhallowed Ruins\nEsluin - Lost Ruins of Zartoff 1 and 2\nJayalne - Desert Pyramid\nChanceyBillups - G_Hopeless, G_WizardLab, G_Mines\nAnduraga - DayNight Settings\nMagicalWisps - Mountain tombs\nSanjuro - Haunted Ruin, Mine Camp\nJEMcKellar - Cavern prefab\nMarcus 'Wayne' Schlegel - Svirfneblin Mine\nAmstradHero - Hills of War\nAmraphael - The Great Petrified Serpent, Keleidsa Estate\nBoozehoundBlue - Mountain Summit\nPrefab items\nApep - Magical Miscellanea\nKaldor Silverwand - Apothecary and Miscellanea\nSeryn - Potions and Drinks of the Forgotten Realms\nCreatures\nBouncyRock/JohnnyRee - Beholder, Drider\nRWS - Creature Conversion Project (Manticore, Purple Worm, Sharks, Naga, Ooze, Gelatinous Cube)\nEvilEdison - Efreeti, Hill Giants and Giant Weapons\nArpharazon - Basilisk, Rust monster, Snake\nStoryteller - Undead Blueprints, Gnoll blueprints, Lizardfolk blueprints\nQk - Goblin Worg Riders\nGPS - Packhorse\nSgtWhy - Barghest\nShaughn - Rock-hurling giants\nArmour/weapon models\nVPJ - Trident pack\nDaggerKnight - Elven Armour\nMisterBritish - Glacier's Edge\nMWMDragon - Warhammer pack, Ultima BlackSword\nDMCB - Yeoman of the Guard\nAlban and Qk - Rurual Pack\nWild Bill - Cloaks\nPlaceable weapons\nFX\nHellcow - Cobwebs\nCamb - splatter and vines\nAmraphael - circling birds\nMisc.\nMSpytkowski - New Speed Trees and Mushrooms\n \nAnd thanks to the playtesters:\nTanlaus, dunniteowl, Quixal, nicethugbert, civilized, Damien Jnr, GilradtheGreat\n \nTo anyone I've missed, thank you, and let me know and I'll update the list","Rating":9.55,"Votes":37,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"455":{"Name":"Fallen House Celofraie","Author":"Sanjuro","Submitted":20100906,"Updated":20120219,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Final Version, Temple / Crypt Adventure, Various Settings","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"07","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"07","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Fallen House Celofraie by Sanjuro\nTHIS REQUIRES 1.23 AND MOTB\n=====================\n\nStats at a Glance:\n\n- Designed for a Drow male character � You can play as other races but you will be talked to as if you are male Drow. This for plot reasons if the PC was a female Drow it would drastically change the plot. \n\n-This is a predominately linear module, and roleplaying is pretty limited. There are several side quests and some quests have several different outcomes. \n\n- There are no alignment changes. Most of the situations you will be in are ambiguous in terms of there being evil or not. You have opportunities for better or worse actions but on the whole I leave it up to you to decide whether an action is moral or immoral.\n\n- For classes I would avoid Rogues, you can play as one but there are no traps or locked doors/chests. The next mod I have in mind will be designed for a rogue but I decided to leave these skills out of this module. \n\n-Most of the items are designed for Fighters, Barbarians, Clerics, Rangers, Druids, Bards and perhaps Wizards and Sorcerers but they will have a harder time. If you play as a caster I would suggest being level 8. \n\n- Starting level of 9, you will be leveled to 7 as a Drow and 9 if you are other races. \n\n- Ending level of 10-11\n- 6-8 hours of play\n\n- 4 potential companions, 2 are forced for story reasons you can choose which one you have. \n\n- There is no respawn, so save frequently. Resting is limited to specific areas of the map, most of these have a map pin. Be aware that combat can occur often from dialogue choices with NPC�s. Also the majority of mod is set in the Underdark and it is dark. There are torches and colored light rings in the beginning area. Alternately use Dark vision to navigate. Most of the areas of interest are partially lit, so don�t worry about important items being placed in pitch black areas. \n\n========================================\nImportant Notes:\n\n1) This is my first module. I attempted to root out the bugs in the mod but chances are that I missed some. If you find any issues let me know through comments\n\n2) The mod is fairly dialogue heavy. The majority of it is focused on fleshing out the character relationships and detailing the setting. The majority is also optional. Some areas are pretty combat intensive.\n\n3) The story of this mod takes place around the events in the War of the Spider Queen series of books. Few of the characters in this series appear in the mod. I may have taken liberties with some of the specific lore and some characters. I think of the mod as a what if, scenario based around the events in the series.\n\n4) The custom music is from several sources. The majority is from Fallout 1 composed by Mark Morgan, also there is one clip from Planescape also composed by Mark Morgan and a short track from the Bioshock orchestral score.\n\n5) My scripting skills consist of using Lilacs script generator and plugging in variables in the pre made scripts. So there aren�t many custom scripts. \n\n6) There are four possible companions, 2 are major characters and 1 of them has to be in the party. Depending on your dialog choices you can choose one or eliminate one of them leading to the other. Depending on which major companion you have you will gain access to one of the optional companions but one of the others will not be available. \n\nThe mod is designed for two playthroughs, once with each of the major character. The major companions have large parts to play in the overall story.\n\n\n7) Majority of skills used are Diplomacy and Bluff, Intimidate is used less often . There are no traps or locked doors so Rogues are not very useful. There is no crafting use. \n\n10) There are several NPC in the game that will be much more powerful then your pc and will kill you if you fight them. If these npc�s die the quest string will break for the mod. I have these powerful npc to reflect that you aren�t a high status member of Drow society. If you insult, say a Matron, you would be killed. \n\n========================================\nInstallation:\n\n1) Make sure you remove the files from their respective folders! For instance, DO NOT place the downloaded 'modules' folder into the modules folder on your hard drive. You must instead open the downloaded module folder and place �FallenHouse.mod� into the hard drive (MyDocuments) modules folder.\n\n2) Place �FallanHouse.mod into your MyDocuments/Neverwinter Nights 2/Modules folder.\n\n3) Place all the hack files into your MyDocuments/Neverwinter Nights 2/Hak folder.\n\n4) Place all the music (.bmu) files into your Music folder (once again, under MyDocuments). \n\n5) Place the portrait files in you�re MyDocuments/Neverwinter Nights 2/Portraits folder\n\n6) This is all you need to do for the file aspect. To run the module, load Neverwinter Nights 2 MoTB and select New Game. Then, you must pick New Module and select Fallen House Celofraie. \n========================================\nMusic:\n\nPlanescape:Torment � Mark Morgan and Richard Band\n\nFallout 1 � Mark Morgan\n\nBioshock - Garry Schyman\n\nPlease post any bugs, feedback, questions, concerns or hate mail here in the comment section.\n\nFeedback is very helpful and voting for this module and other modulesis a great way to encourage future projects. \n\n==================================\n\nThanks to the following creators for their great custom content. \n\nRWS Deep Chasms \nAcme Assault Hattery\nChaos Wielder Mind Flayer Cthulhu caves \nAdonnays Elven Weaponry\nNytir�s Aribeth Valsharess Armor\nJonny Ree Beholder\nD15SCORD Enchanted Eyes\nAr Pharazon Drow long sword\nFemale Outfits Aleanne\nFenril Heads\nBriesence Male Elf Heads\nMiss O�s Elf head\nAntenni Lineage 2 armor and weapons\nAzenn Black Wolf Forest\nKomuro Scum Villainy \nTeam Advent Clothes\nStorytellers Blueprints\n\nUpdates notes 1.1 9/9/10\n\n-Erased several conversation links that had been used for testing.\n-Added conversation option for quest\n-Added map notes to make quest item locations more clear.\n\n\nUpdate Notes 1.2 9/18/10\n\nMostly smaller fixes\n\n-Fixed conversation node where items could be taken multiple times\n-Fixed issue with quest not running because conversation node set to once per conversation.\n-Cleaned up one more left test option.\n-fixed several grammar and spelling issues.\n-fixed some naming issues for several creatures and items.\n","Rating":8.79,"Votes":14,"Awards":[]},"456":{"Name":"Edinmoor","Author":"Dorateen","Submitted":20100909,"Updated":20101126,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dungeon Adventure, Final Version, Hardcore Rules","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"07","Max Character Level":"09","Gameplay Length":"09","Patch":"1.21","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Edinmoor Court holds a sinister secret. For as far back as Men can remember, the keep has stood as a utopian beacon of peace, where artisans flock to share their skills, creativity, and imagination. But now the unthinkable has happened, and murder is committed inside these walls. \n\nBlood on the stones of the citadel.\n\nWill your party have the courage to seek the source of the evil that has taken place? Will you help or hinder the investigation...\n\n*This is a party-based adventure designed for 5 characters of 7th level. Click on the White Stallion\nand choose the option to Gather your Party, which will bring up the Party Editor Menu\n\n*This campaign uses the Storm of Zehir Party Chat style conversations throughout. I have tried to\nspread a broad selection of class, alignment, stats, skill ranks, race, deity, and even gender \nattributes throughout the various dialogue options, which will give those party members a chance \nto make their voice heard. I would say that Bards, Clerics, Wizards, Rogues, and Druids are well \nrepresented. Paladins should be a welcome addition to the Party. And also intelligent or charatcers with high wisdom. Diplomacy will come into play in many conversations.\n\n*The campaign is designed for characters of Good or Neutral alignment.\n\n*This campaign uses the Storm of Zehir death system. Characters will start bleeding\nif they drop below 0 hitpoints, and will die when they exceed negative half their total\nhitpoints. There is no Respawn. When a character dies, you will need to use a Raise Dead \nscroll to bring them back. There are 2 NPC priests who have such scrolls for sale. \nUse the members of the party tactically. Save early and save often.\n\n*This campaign uses restricted resting. You will find campfires scattered about the various areas.\nClicking on the campfire will bring up the option to Rest.\n\n*Click on the White Stallion to travel between wilderness areas, once those paths have opened up.\n\n*There is one companion available to join the Party.\n\nKnown issue: The companion has a deity of Hoar. The first time you get to level him up, the game \nwill force you choose a Nature deity, due to his class. One option is to level the companion as \na new class such as Fighter, and keep Hoar as the deity. However, if you do select another deity,\nKelemvor might make a good choice.\n\nKnown issue: I had hoped to make use of the crafting system from the NWN2 Origianl Campaign. Unfortunately, \ndue to conflicts with the SoZ scripts, I have not been able to get the crafting items and workbenches to \nfunction properly. \n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nplace the \"Edinmoor\" folder in the following directory:\nNeverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\n\nplace the .mod file in the following directory:\nNeverwinter Nights 2\\modules\n\nplace the Edinmoor.hak file in the following directory:\nNeverwinter Nights 2\\hak\n\nStart the adventure by selecting a New Campaign.\n\nCREDITS\n\nThis Campaign uses the following Custom Content:\n\nJasonNH's \"Empath Abbey\" pre-fab.\n\nRWS \"Deep Halls\" tilesets and Ceature pack.\n\nShaugn78's \"Boulder Toss\" Giants.\n\nUgly_Duck's \"Forest\" pre-fab.\n\nJezla9's \"Sharpstone Village\" pre-fab.\n\nIn addition, I would like to thank the following members of the community for their assistance:\n\n*Jason NH, besides the \"Empath Abbey\", which is stunning, also combined all the haks and overrides\nint the single .hak file.\n\n*PJ156 for a thorough playtesting of this module and giving me much needed feedback on combat balance.\nAny remaining issues or questionable design decisions are me own fault, either through stubborness\nor oversight.\n\n*Kaldor Silverwand for his scripts granting XP for picking locks and disabling traps.\n\n*Nicethugbert for background information about the Forgotten Realms deities Garagos and Hoar.

Your memories are gone, yet there is no sense of urgency or burning desire to discover your past. You are pulled into an epic journey and battle that extends throughout the realm. You will rise to become a powerful hero against an unknown and growing evil that threatens all. \n\nThis is a single player game for a new starting character at level 1.\n\nRisen Hero is a story driven linear game. Side quest are provided to allow for character development and deviation from the linear plot line. Some choices made on side quest will have effects on the main plot. The player will find themselves without any equipment in the wake of a army. They must scavenge for weapons and armor while trying to stay alive. \n\nKey Points about Game Play: ---Please Read---\n\n*The game uses Lance Botelle's Fog of War. \n-Area maps will often be hidden by the fog of war (black), the areas must be explored and mapped to remove the fog. To map, the area map must be opened. Mapping is not possible during combat. \n-At level three a feat is avaliable to allow the player to map an area (remove the fog) with the area map closed. It requires 4 ranks in spot and 2 ranks in survival. The player or companion can obtain this to feat and does not need to be player controlled to use. A provided companion will meet all the requirements for the feat at level 3.\n-The minimmap represents the players line of sight and can no longer be zoomed in/out. It is often disabled in interior areas.\nFor more information on the Fog of War:\nLink\nLink\n\n*The game uses Tonk_K improved monster and companion AI. There are additional behavior options on their character sheet and by right clicking on weapons and shields they can be set to be used by the AI. For the description see his vault page.\n Link\n\n*Game used kaedrin's PCR. This includes new base and prestige classes, feats, cleric domains and spells. Visit his vault page for all the new features. This is required to play the game.\nLink\n\n*Due to the survival aspect of this game often the player will be unable to backtrack. The player should fully explore areas before moving on with the plot line. Most side quest are only accessible in certain areas and once the player leaves these areas those side quests will be inaccessible.\n\n*Risen Hero is meant to be a challenging game: -SAVE OFTEN-\n -Though there is a progression of easy to more difficult monsters there are several very challenging creatures and battles created to challenge the player. These battles are generally optional and do not block plot points. Players who can defeat these battles are rewarded with loot while those who know to run away are rewarded with their lives.\n -Races with a greater than +1 level adjustment will have a much greater difficulty\n -Some battles can be avoided through the use of skills or companions. While some companions may help you avoid the battle, others will provoke it.\n\n*Secret passages are secret and must be found with a search check, subtle hints have been placed near them. They can be found out of search mode, but with a higher check. Static placeables (items that won't highlight) and lighting changes have been placed at some passages to provide hints of their presence. \n\n*Companions are spread throughout the campaign. Only 3 will approach the player and offer to join. The others must be found. The 3 evil companions will require a skill check to convince them to join the party. All companions are optional and the game can be completed with no companions, but the challenge will be much higher. 1 companion is forced for the kobold caves but can removed after.\n\n*A system has been created to allow the player to sneak past encounters and earn increasing experience points for each encounter avoided. This system is used in the kobold cave and the surrounding forest. The player controlled character (either PC or companion) must be in stealth mode, companions not is stealth mode will apply penalties and companions that are in stealth mode and make either a spot or listen check within 5 meters of the player will provide a bonus to hide check.\n\n*The campaign uses the Forgotten Realm as it's setting, but is far from 100% true to the lore. It is loosely set several years after Icewind Dale II. The story itself doesn't actually fit into any time line and aspects are drawn from the various times and much of the lore has been altered to fit the story or by my own interpretations.\n\n*The campaign is mainly designed for a good or neutral aligned character. Several side quest allow for an �evil� completion path. Generally if your character is a jerk, the NPCs will be less receptive or even hostile towards you. Some items and quests may not be offered to jerks as well. \n\n*This is part one to a series that is still incomplete. There is a definite ending to this chapter and I plan on completing the story.\n\nWhat is included:\n-Eight companions all with unique conversations and numerous interjects and banter\n-MotB influence system that effects all companions\n-A new relationship system that tracks how companions feel about each other. A positive relationship will provide benefits while a toxic relationship will apply penalties\n-Fully compatible and requires Kaedrin's PrC Pack\n-Uses Tony K companion and Monster AI improvements\n-Lots of custom content created by the Neverwinter Nights 2 community\n-Use of multiple cutscenes and lip flappers\n-SOZ death and bleeding\n-Limited resting system and wandering monsters\n-Allows players in stealth mode to avoid placed encounters (in specific areas, see above)\n-Custom load screens and load hints\n-Very few placed +something items. Most every item placed has a name and unique description\n-New companion race, Half-Fiend, +4 level adjustment and new racial feats applied during level up.\n-New taunt feats provided available to Half-Orc companion. Combines taunt checks with other skills to have increased effects on opponents. Two feats can be unlocked during game play.\n\n*Taunt: Desecrate Corpse\nUnique Ability\nJarogniew has perfected the taunt ability.\n\n\nWhat is Not Included:\n-Open ended free play\n-Romanceable Companions\n-The more exotic races will not be recognized except for maybe several very specific points in conversations (Genasi, Yuan-Ti, Grey Orcs)\n-Overland map area or world map\n\nKnown Issues:\n-Several cave textures do not match. Some of the SOZ textures don't apply to all tiles.\n-Sneak path of Dor'Gallon Fort. When loading a saved game in the fort often the script will fire before the player has a chance to hide and will be caught. It is safe to save game in slave pen half-way through.\n-Companion Jarogniew doesn't use melee weapons. To avoid entering loops of AI equipping and unequipping weapons either do not have him carry extra weapons or disable the auto weapon swapping on his behavior tab.\n\nInstructions for Installation: Download the 5 files: everything is needed to play is included\nAll files should be placed in the c:\\Documents and Settings\\<YoUR NAME>\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\ \n\nTo remove the main menu change.

When you open your eyes, all you see is shadow, unable to differentiate yourself from the multitude of voices you wander. You may have once been a great hero, a powerful arcanist, or merely a lowly thief, but no matter what you were before, you are a Asper. So shall you remain until you discover the reason behind your cursed state, and more importantly, how you may escape it. \n\n--------------------------------------\nSetting: \n\nYou can play your own role, that of another, or mix them up, all is open to an Asper. Though it takes place in it's own world, it can be incorporated into most other medieval fantasy settings, which allows about anybody's character to fit in. \n\n--------------------------------------\nLevel Requirement: \n\nNote that the first area of this module checks if your level 5 and above, if your not it will give you the necessary amount of experience to get to that level, but note that Races with ECLs of +1 or greater will start at lower levels. \n\n--------------------------------------\nInstallation:\n\nStep 1 \nUse Winrar(Choose one of the first two; depending on if you have 32 bit or 64 bit, on the top of the list) or 7zip or other extractor to extract the Nihil Trilogy Folder.

This bug concerned the fact that lights lose their tags after the game is reloaded, and the only solution is to use the SetLocalObject and GetLocalObject to repair it. For this I give true commendations as it finally allowed a perfect implementation of the end battle scenes for those who want to take a more leisurely pace through the game instead of relying purely on the all at once approach. Though not critical to completing the mod before, it nonetheless was a thorn in my side when it came to scripting the final battle scene, and I'm glad to say it is finally repaired to my satisfaction.\n\n-Second, I learned enough about C++ to make a auto-installer for my mod; also something that has persisted since beta, and that was just released as well with the update, and is available on the link below.\n\n-Third, a new mini-game was added to the Weary Rest Inn.\n\n-Other minor visual changes, mostly to interior areas.\n\n---------------------------------------\nUpdates as of 12/4/2010\n\n-Added a walkthrough of one possible path of the game on Youtube.

They did not ask permission and I certainly did not grant it.\n\nPath of Evil:\n\nStory: Unlike other adventures, you are the villain of the story. This means it's up to you to decide what needs to be done. No Aldanon rambling on, no Nasher to give specific instructions. One companion will provide a very general framework for you, but it's up to you to figure out where to go and what to do. Did anyone tell Ammon Jerro how to defeat the King of Shadows? No, he figured things out himself. You may be told you are looking for an item in a city, and it's up to you to find it.\n\nBecause of this, Path of Evil comes off as being \"story-lite\", that's because you're making the story as you go, becoming the villain. Path of Evil is about the history of a villain before they \"threaten the Realms\". Once you leave Neverwinter, Path of Evil has an open world.\n\nYou are not required to agree with every evil thing in Faerun. For example you can tell people your personal code means people should be free and refuse slaving quests. Similarly, companions can and do have \"non evil\" traits such as caring for their family. They're not all homocidal maniacs, and you don't have to be either.\n\nAfter the first few hours, Path of Evil has an open world like Storn of Zehir where you can explore randomly. You start at level one and should finish between level 15-20, depending on how many things you do. I would not expect anyone to be able to finish with less than a level 13 party. Expect 30+ hours of gameplay. \n\nOh yeah, you can run a stronghold, just like in the OC. \n\nInstallation: Files are in directory format. NWN2 handles this just fine. Copy the contents of the folders to their corresponding folder in your My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder. The folders in the modules.7z go into your modules folder, the folders in the other.7z go into your My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder. This way I can release a small fix of any specific issues that arise rather that requiring you to redownload an entire module.\n\nPreferred race or class: None. For the first 4 levels, you get almost completely different quests depending on whether you are a divine caster, arcane caster, rogue, or fighter type. If you are playing a custom base class such as Thug of Ninja, Kaedrin classes, that is detected and you will be asked in character what \"path\" you want for the first few levels. Races with ECL of higher than 1 will make life very difficult early on. Races and classes can give you access to extra bits of content including different ways to resolve a few quests. I didn't block creating good aligned characters, but the story assumes you are and the game engine gives evil points for killing good aligned npc's, so you soon will be evil.\n\nMagic: +1 is common and virtually all merchants outside slums will have them. +2 are available from a good assortment of merchants. +3 are extremely rare and typically only found as specific treasure. By the end, you will likely have mix of +2 and +3 gear. Official Faerun lore lists the gods as having +5 weapons, so things have been scaled with that in mind. Likewise elemental and other damage has been restricted to a single point or two. \n\nSkill Use: Plenty. Companions skills are checked in conversation.\n\nCombat: Many encounters scale but have min/max difficulty. Your level 15 party is never going to be challenged going into a goblin cave typically intended as a level 6-8 encounter. On the other hand some encounters, especially bosses, are placed and you might find one at a low level. Just as in SoZ, the open world design means you can get in over your head if you're not careful. To reinforce this point, it's possible to pick a fight with two iron golems and a level 18 wizard at level 1, they will of course crush you (unless you cheat, but they have no treasure).\n\nCombat/Dialog/Puzzle balance: plenty of the first two, very few puzzles, and the puzzles can be solved via character skills.\n\nCrafting: OC style. In most cities you must joing a local guild for a nominal fee. There are also crafting stations to be found elsewhere. Essences are relatively rare and typically only found as placed treasure, though the weakest essences are available for sale in some places. You can craft weapons that do 1-6 elemental damage. I did not change the crafting system to keep maximum compatibility (see compatibility note below).\n\nDeath system: In Neverwinter, which covered the first 4 levels or so, Path of Evil uses the OC death system, you're unconscious at 0 hp and pop up after combat. After that it switches to the SoZ death. You get an out of character note ingame when this happens and are given a coin of life.\n\nCompatibility: I kept 2da editing to a minimum and used the default tlk file to minimize possible compatibility problems. Note that because of this one companion has a nonstandard god which does not appear ingame though the companion will often talk about them. Just pick something you think is appropriate for them when they level up :-) I used Kaedrin's classpack myself during all testing.\n\nEnvironments: In Neverwinter it's never quite dark, even underground. After that it is. Go into a cave and away from the entrance it is often pitch black. There are maps where everything is pitch black. Bring a light source or use darkvision. Torches are available in each town. It also tends to be darker outdoors at night and brighter during the day than official campaigns. In a few areas, heavy fog simulates different environmental conditions such as sandstorms and will restrict your visibility.\n\nAI: TonyK's is built in. If you really hate it, it can be removed from the campaign folder.\n\nMusic: Other than in inns and taverns, there is none. It's a design decision. If you hear some, please report it, it's a bug.\n\nVoiceovers, lip flappers, cutscenes, romance options, companion influence systems: Nope, sorry. Path of Evil was a one man show and I concentrated on other things. except for one or two places where I forced a specific camera angle. If you do get some bizarre angle when the game uses the NWN2 conversations, let me know and I'll force a camera (otherwise it's random).\n\nCompanions: There are 11 companions. Party size is 5 max. Two companions are forced for the first module. After that you may dismiss them. No companions are necessary for plot or required after that except for areas specific to their sidequests. If you dismiss a companion, they are gone for good, you can not dismiss a companion that has something in their inventory necessary for the main quest. You can dismiss a companion who has something necessary for a sidequest however. You should have thought about that before dismissing them.\n\nCompanions are joined at level 1 and given your current xp, so you may level them as you wish. Companions may be multiclassed. There are 2 rogues, two fighters, a ranger, 2 wizards, a sorceror, 2 clerics, and a favored soul. They are not all \"stat optimized\" but do have good scores in their typical primary stats and sometimes others. Some have more than a 32 point buy, or extra feats that would make them otherwise \"illegal\", this is on purpose. One has special restrictions which would be a spoiler to reveal, but there in an OOC note put ingame for him to explain (There is a game engine limitation).\n\nEach companion can comment on any quest (with the exception that only Neverwinter companions can be asked about Neverwinter quests), and any other companion, but you must ask them via right-click talk. They have roughly 3,000 words of dialog each. It doesn't matter if they were in the party when the quest was done, presumably you told them about things while \"on the road\".\n\nEach companion except one also has a sidequest or unique way of interacting with the pc. You can ask the companion about themselves and they will fill you in on their quest. Because some areas can only be entered once, it may not be possible to complete their quests depending on where you go and when.\n\nIf you dismiss a companion, except under very limited circumstances, they are gone. They have their own objectives and will not hang around waiting until they are useful to you again. There is no companion influence though, they will not leave if they disapprove of anything you do or have other party members they do not like.\n\nSpecial Note: Your character can gain extra feats and abilities beyond the normal ones from level progression. That will make them register as an \"illegal character\" if you try to use them somewhere else that checks that.\n\nSecond Special Note: I forgot to include Arkalezth (testing) and Apep (item pack) in the endgame credits.

If you do not have a backup then you will have to reinstall the OC, MotB, and SoZ. \n\nBecause of the significant changes to the game behavior introduced with the Makeover it will not be completely compatible with other game modifications that alter the standard module scripts or the UI. \n\n------------------ \nCompatibility with Kaedrin's PrC Pack: \nKaedrin's PrC Pack disables some of the Makeover features: \n- the automatic pausing of Spirit Energy consumption when idle \n- the Item Level restrictions \n- the Resting restrictions \n------------------ \n\nThis collection is specifically designed for use when playing the NWN2 MotB expansion. If properly installed it will not affect the OC, SoZ, or 3rd party modules and campaigns. \n\nThe author, Brendan Bellina (aka Kaldor Silverwand in the NWN2 forums and NWN2 Vault), is not in any way responsible for any use of the components in this collection. This collection is provided for free and without warranty. Grateful missives may be directed to bbellina@alumni.nd.edu. \n\nThe Makeover can be applied either before beginning or after beginning the Neverwinter Nights 2 MotB campaign. If applied after already beginning a campaign then the recipe books and Campaigner's Guide will not be available (these are not required anyway) and spawned NPC's in already loaded modules will not be able to be spoken to except by the main PC. Also depending on where you are in the campaign some optional plot paths and optional items may not be available. \n\nTo get the most from the Makeover and avoid bugs it is recommended that you start a new game using the Makeover, but it is not mandatory that you do so. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\nMany features can be customized by editing two 2da files included with the Makeover with a text editor such as Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Macintosh). There is no longer a need to use the Toolset to customize the features. See section \"Customizing the Makeover Features\" below to learn how to customize the features. \n\nAdditions to Player Menu: \nOptions to open the Party Editor and the Player Chat are available in the Player Menu. \n\n(The default player menu is condensed. If you prefer a slightly larger menu then navigate to the C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\\UI folder (on Mac the Campaigns folder will be in the Applications/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder - if NWN2 was installed from CD - or in Neverwinter Nights 2.app/Contents - if installed from the Mac App Store) and rename playermenu_popup.xml to playermenu_popup-small.xml, and rename playermenu_popup-large.xml to playermenu_popup.xml.) \n\nParty Creation: \nSoZ Party Creation is enabled. This allows up to 6 player created party members (one of which is the main PC) in addition to the standard OC companions. Party Members are created via the Party Editor option in the Player Menu. The Party Editor option can be accessed at any time. This is comparable to the guestbooks used in SoZ. (Note that player-created characters will be excluded from the Dreamscape except in the final battle areas). \n\nPlayer-created party members will start at level 1 unless you have leveled them up elsewhere. Vordan's Hero Creator is a useful training module for creating, leveling up, and outfitting characters that can be imported with the party editor. The recommended minimum level for MotB is level 18. \n\n(The number of party members allowed can be altered by altering the Campaign properties using the toolset Campaign plug-in. Unfortunately this cannot be altered except by using the NWN2 Toolset.) \n\nEnhancement of the initial provisioning: \nWhen the campaign begins the initial player will be provided the recipe books and a few coins of life. \n\nMulti-classing Companions: \nCompanions can be multi-classed when leveling up. \n\nFor multi-classing purposes Gann's favored class is Barbarian. Other non-human companions either have no selectable favored class, or their initial class is their favored class. \n\nMaximum number of companions: \nThe party limit of 5 has been increased to 8 to allow full use of the companions. (The optional OC companions that may join during Act II do not count against this limit.) \n\nNPC Conversation enhancement: \nAll NPC's that have the standard spawn script (most of them) can be conversed with by any member of the party rather than just the main PC. Because most conversations are designed to be with the main PC only there may be bugs introduced by using party members for important conversations. \n\nBecause the final areas in the game are very Spirit Eater centric, in those areas only the main PC can speak to NPCs. \n\nDeath and Bleeding System: \nWhen the game is played on Normal or higher difficulty mode the SoZ Death system will be applied to the party members. In addition an XP penalty will be applied to characters when they are killed. Party members will remain dead when killed and will be valid targets for resurrection. Because the campaign requires companions to be alive often during transitions and conversations unexpected behavior may occur if a companion is dead at such a time. Death will cause a permanent experience point loss to the character. The Coins of Life used in the SoZ will be available to be used to resurrect dead characters. \n\nPlaying in Easy mode will cause the death system to behave as it does in the unmodified OC except that there will be an XP penalty applied when dying. This XP penalty will not be enough to cause de-leveling. \n\nRest System: \nThe rest system implemented causes the party to rest for 8 hours. When the game is played on Normal or higher difficulty mode resting is restricted to once in an 8 hour period and restricted to natural areas. There is a context menu option to allow a single character to meditate, regaining health and spells instantly.\n\nItem Level Restriction: \nEquippable enchanted weapons and armor can be restricted to use based on the level of enchantment and the level of the person attempting to equip the item. A person must have 2 levels of experience more than the level of enchantment. This is not a feature of SoZ but was added in the Makeover to attempt to keep game balance. \n\nRechargeable staves, wands, and rods: \nStandard staves, wands, and rods can be recharged by making them the target of arcane spells. This is not a feature available in SoZ. Nothing forces you to use this feature, but if you want to make it impossible to use then do not copy the folder Rechargeable Mage Items into the campaign folder. \n\nEnhanced SoZ Crafting and Enchanting: \nAll items that can be crafted in SoZ can also be crafted in MotB using the existing workbenches in MotB. Items that require trade resources in SoZ to craft will require an equivalent wood or ingots. Recipes are automatically placed in the Recipe Books, as in SoZ, however the recipe books are no longer cursed and can be given to any party member to carry. Also, unlike SoZ, recipes do not need to be in a recipe book in order to be used. Recipes and components will be randomly available in standard MotB stores. The recipes and components are added to the store inventory only the first time a store is opened. Each store has a 66% chance of having recipes and components. Items are normally limited to 3 enchantments unless the caster is an epic caster (> 20 levels) in which case 4 enchantments can be applied. Several item properties no longer count against the number of enchantments, including: light, visual effects, racial/class/alignment restrictions, and penalizing properties (curses). Masterwork items (identified by tag ending in _mast) are no longer penalized by having one fewer enchantment allowed. The inherent properties of items based on their material type will no longer count against the number of enchantments on the item (this is based on the standard tag names and is not guaranteed to work with non-standard items).\n\nSome merchants are guaranteed to have SoZ items: \n- Feodorra and Magda will have low level recipes and common crafting components \n- Katya and Shelvedar will have healing items, medium level recipes, and common crafting components \n- Azim will have healing items, medium level recipes, and rare crafting components \n- Omaga will have healing items, high level recipes and rare crafting components \n\nA number of additional items that were intended to be craftable in SoZ but were not due to bugs and/or missing recipes or items can also be crafted. These include: \n- Acid Bomb \n- Fire Bomb \n- Bracers of Armor +4 \n- Gauntlets of Dexterity +2 \n- Adamantine Breastplate \n- Poison Bolts \n- Darksteel Darts \n- Darksteel Shuriken \n- Darksteel Throwing Axes \n- Cold Iron Halberd \n- Darksteel Halberd \n\nFixed crafted items include: \n- Adamantine arrows (added magical +2 damage) \n- Adamantine bolts (added magical +2 damage) \n\nAll SoZ Enchantments are available. Only enchantments that are available in the OC are available in the Makeover. \n\nCompanion Conversations updated so that you can take their gear even when they are not currently in the party. \n\nNasher's Items are supported in the game in case they are imported from the OC Makeover \n\nSpirit energy is not lost if standing idly (this will prevent it from being lost while using inventory or leveling up or waiting until dawn/dusk). Spirit energy is still lost when resting. Spirit energy can be regained by consuming Spirit Essences.\n\nDuring Ice Troll combat challenge the player-created party members other than the main PC will be frozen. \n\nBecause the OC Makeover allowed Shandra Jerro to accompany the Knight Captain to the final KOS confrontation, conversations in the MotB Makeover about the OC companions include references to Shandra. \n\n----------------------- \n\nCustomizing the Makeover Features: \n\nThe behavior of the rest system, death system, and Item Level Restriction system can be customized by editing the 2da file \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\\NWN2 MotB Makeover SoZ Edition\\mo_nx1_options.2da\". (On Mac the Campaigns folder will be in the Applications/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder - if NWN2 was installed from CD - or in Neverwinter Nights 2.app/Contents - if installed from the Mac App Store). \n\nThe behavior of the crafting system can be customized by editing the 2da file \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\\NWN2 MotB Makeover SoZ Edition\\SoZCraftingPlus\\SoZCraftingPlus_options.2da\". (On Mac the Campaigns folder will be in the Applications/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder - if NWN2 was installed from CD - or in Neverwinter Nights 2.app/Contents - if installed from the Mac App Store). \n\nEach of these files can be edited using a standard text editor such as Windows Notepad (just start Notepad and drag the file to edit into the open Notepad window) or Mac OS X TextEdit (just drag the file to edit onto the TextEdit application icon in the Applications folder or Dock). These files are read when when a module is loaded, so it is recommended that you save your game before editing them and then reload your saved game after editing them. A 2da file is simply a spreadsheet-like text file containing rows and columns. Each row has an integer identifier, starting with value 0, and several columns of data. The columns are delimited by spaces. While they can be edited using the toolset, the author does not recommend that. \n\nIn each file the columns are: \n- Row ID (For NWN2 2da's the ID column has no column header) \n- LABEL - this is the name of the feature. These must not be edited. \n- ENABLED - This indicates whether a feature is enabled (\"1\") or not (\"0\") or enablement is not relevant (\"****\"). \n- VALUE - An integer value that is relevant to the feature. If no value is relevant then the column will contain \"****\". \n- DESCRIPTION - A complete explanation of the feature, its allowed range of values, and its effect on game play. \n\nThe rows in the default mo_nx1_options.2da file are: \n\nLABEL ENABLED VALUE DESCRIPTION \n0 GAMEDIFF 0 0 \"GAMEDIFF adjustment: 1 for knockout death and no death penalty and no rest restrictions; 2 for knockout death and no rest restrictions)\" \n1 MIN_HR_BETWEEN_REST 1 8 \"Minimum number of hours required between resting (ignored in very easy or easy Game Difficulty Mode or when GAMEDIFF = 1 or 2)\" \n2 NATURAL_RESTING_ONLY 1 **** \"Restrict resting to natural areas (ignored in very easy or easy Game Difficulty Mode or when GAMEDIFF = 1 or 2)\" \n3 KNOCKOUT_DEATH 0 **** \"Use knockout death system (automatic when Game Difficulty Mode is set to very easy or easy or when GAMEDIFF = 1 or 2)\" \n4 XP_DEATHPENALTY 1 **** \"Apply an xp death penalty when a party member dies (ignored in very easy or easy Game Difficulty Mode or when GAMEDIFF = 1)\" \n5 ILR_NWN 0 **** \"Enforce Item Level Restriction for all equipped items based on NWN value table (which is based on item cost)\" \n6 ILR_NWN_ADJ **** 0 \"Integer adjustment (positive or negative) to item value when using ILR_NWN\" \n7 ILR_NWN_DIV **** 0 \"Divide the required level by this integer when using ILR_NWN (0 is treated as 1)\" \n8 ILR_ENHBONUS 1 **** \"Use Item Level Restriction on Enhanced Weapons where minimum level required to use is Weapon Enhancement Bonus plus 2\" \n9 ILR_ENHBONUS_MULT2 0 **** \"Require 2*Enh Bonus levels rather than 2+Enh Bonus levels when using ILR_ENHBONUS\" \n10 ILR_ACBONUS 1 **** \"Use Item Level Restriction on Enhanced Armor where minimum level required to wear is Armor AC Bonus plus 2 \n11 ILR_ACBONUS_MULT2 0 **** \"Require 2*AC Bonus rather than 2+AC Bonus when using ILR_ACBONUS\" \n\nThe most common user requests have been to disable the SoZ death/dying system, disable the XP death penalty, disable the rest restrictions, and disable the Item Level Restriction feature. By default these features are all enabled. The rows in the 2da file allow control over each of these settings. \n\nGAMEDIFF (row 0) if enabled (ENABLED set to 1) and set to value 1 will replace the SoZ Death/Dying sysem with the Knockout system used by the unmodified campaign, eliminate the XP death penalty, and remove the rest restrictions. If enabled (ENABLED set to 1) and set to value 2 it will use the Knockout system and remove the rest restrictions but leave in place the XP death penalty. If ENABLED is 0 then any value is ignored. \n\nMIN_HR_BETWEEN_REST (row 1) and NATURAL_RESTING_ONLY (row 2) allow specific control over the rest system. If you wish to only disable the rest restrictions then change the value in the enabled column of these rows to 0. These rows are ignored if GAMEDIFF is enabled and set to value 1 or 2. \n\nKNOCKOUT_DEATH (row 3) and XP_DEATHPENALTY (row 4) allow specific control over the death system. To use the OC death system enable KNOCKOUT_DEATH (ignored if GAMEDIFF is enabled and set to value 1 or 2). To disable the XP Death Penalty set the ENABLED column of the XP_DEATHPENALTY row to 0 (ignored if GAMEDIFF is enabled and set to value 1). \n\nThe remaining rows (5-11) affect the Item Level Restriction feature. If ILR_NWN (row 5) is enabled then ILR_NWN_ADJ (row 6) and ILR_NWN_DIV (row 7) can optionally have values, otherwise they are ignored. To completely disable Item Level Restriction set the ENABLED column to 0 for ILR_NWN (row 5), ILR_ENHBONUS (row 8), and ILR_ACBONUS (row 10). \n\nThe rows in the default SoZCraftingPlus_options.2da file are: \n\nLABEL ENABLED VALUE DESCRIPTION \n0 CONVERT_GOODS 1 **** \"Convert SoZ goods requirements to standard goods\" \n1 CONVERT_RARERES 1 **** \"Convert SoZ rare resource requirements to standard resources\" \n2 ENCH_ALLOW_SATCHEL 0 **** \"Allow satchel to be used for enchanting in place of mage bench\" \n3 CFT_ALLOW_SATCHEL 0 **** \"Allow satchel to be used for crafting in place of mage bench\" \n4 CFT_ALLOW_MORTAR 0 **** \"Allow Mortar and Pestle to be used for crafting in place of alchemist bench\" \n5 CFT_ALLOW_HAMMER 0 **** \"Allow smith hammer to be used for crafting in place of craftsman/smith bench\" \n6 XP_CRAFT_PCT 0 10 \"Reduce crafter's xp by specified percentage of gold cost when crafting\" \n7 XP_ENCH_PCT 0 25 \"Reduce enchanter's xp by specified percentage of gold cost when enchanting\" \n8 DESTROY_RECIPES 0 **** \"Allow the possibility of recipes being destroyed when used\" \n9 DESTROY_RECIPE_MIN **** 1 \"Integer minimum percentage risk (0-99) of a recipe being destroyed when DESTROY_RECIPES enabled\" \n10 DESTROY_RECIPE_MULT **** 0 \"Integer multiplier used in calculating risk of a recipe being destroyed. Higher numbers increase risk.\" \n\nWith these default settings: \n- Soz recipes that require SoZ specific goods or rare resources will require appropriate bars and planks; \n- mobile enchanting/crafting using the satchel, mortar and pestle, and smithhammer is not allowed; \n- crafting/enchanting will not consume xp from the crafter/enchanter; \n- and there is no possibility that a recipe will be consumed by its use. \n\n----------------------- \n\nStory alterations and MotB bug fixes: \n\nCallous references to the deaths of OC companions made by the gargoyles in the Shadow Theater have been removed. \n\nThe Inarus conversation has been altered to correct the bugs that allowed the creation of multiple elementals and ghouls and repeated influence gains with Okku. Also an alignment shift toward evil has been added if the player consumes a spirit or soul. \n\nInarus will now participate with the other masters in the Red Wizard showdown if not already dealt with. His keyring and robes can be recovered from his corpse. \n\nLamentations of the Dead acquire bug fixed. \n\nTome of Rebirth acquire bug fixed (corrected campaign script name) \n\nThe Dream Weapon longsword bug is fixed and the Dream Weapon enhanced to work with all party members and be able to be transformed to the additional forms: Bastard Sword, Club, Falchion, Handaxe, Katana, Kukri, Light Crossbow, Morningstar, Rapier, Scythe, Short Sword, Spear, and Warhammer. \n\nThe size and appearance of Okku can be changed to make him more manageable as a companion. To alter his size or appearance speak with him. \n\nAn alternate method of recovering Ammon Jerro's soul has been implemented that does not require trading souls. This is intended for good characters and may not be available if the SE has been consuming everyone in sight. \n\nAn alternate method of opening the door to the astral plane is provided that does not require the fusing of souls. \n\nRemoved options to destroy the scribes until Ammon Jerro has been recovered. This was needed to allow the alternate recovery of AJ's soul. \n\nIt is now possible for evil characters to gain the Eternal Rest feat via the Myrkul's Priest conversation. (suggested by puiwaihin) \n\nAdded appropriate locations of broken ring and broken scythe. These were missing in MotB but their descriptions indicated the areas in which they should be found. \n\nAmmon Jerro now functions as a full companion and will level up accordingly. Other optional companions are also available. \n\nThe students in the academy no longer say things that indicate class is continuing if their instructors are absent. (They will stay seated though. They are a very well disciplined group.) \n\nSome of the weapons used by special enemies will now be dropped. (They could use them against you, so it only seems fair that you should be able to use them as well.) \n\n----------------------- \n\nKnown limitations: \n\nThere is no Overland Map \n\nThere is no SoZ party conversation, although you may use any party member to speak to NPC's. \n\nParty members should not be dropped when transitions occur, but just in case save often. \n\nCompanions may pop back to life or stand when dead if they are involved in cutscenes. This may also affect player created characters. Save often. \n\nBefore changing to or from easy game difficulty, save the game. Reload after changing the difficulty setting. \n\nThe ending slides still assume you are playing a male human. \n\n----------------------- \n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\nSPECIAL NOTES FOR STEAM USERS: \n\nIn order to follow the installation instructions for Steam, references below to \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Night 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\\\" and its subfolders would on Steam be folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\neverwinter nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\\\" and its subfolders. \n\nThe Modules folder for Steam is \"C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\neverwinter nights 2\\Modules\". \n\n(The author thanks BlakOrkz for providing the information for the Steam install.) \n\nSPECIAL NOTES FOR MACINTOSH USERS: \n\nIn order to follow the installation instructions on a Macintosh, references to folders and files depend on whether you installed NWN2 from CD or by purchasing it from the Mac App Store. The Campaigns folder will be in the Applications/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder - if NWN2 was installed from CD - or in Neverwinter Nights 2.app/Contents - if installed from the Mac App Store. \n\nSimilarly the Modules folder is in the Applications/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder - if NWN2 was installed from CD - or in Neverwinter Nights 2.app/Contents - if installed from the Mac App Store. \n\nBecause the NWN2 Toolset is not available on the Macintosh it is strongly recommended that you make a backup of the campaign folder before installing any files into it. The simplest way to do this is right-click on \"Applications/Neverwinter Nights 2/Data/Campaigns/Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1/\" and select the option \"Compress Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\". This will create a zip file that can be used to restore the original campaign folder if you want to later uninstall the Makeover. (If you installed from the Mac App Store you will have to copy the Neverwinter Night2 Campaign folder to another location before compressing it.) \n\nSPECIAL NOTE FOR ALL USERS OF THE MAKEOVER: \n\nWARNING: This installation will update the NWN2 MotB campaign folder (Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\\). (It will also add two new modules to the modules folder, but that shouldn't be a cause of alarm). It is strongly recommended that you patch to current before installing the Makeover. It is also very strongly recommended that you make a backup of your NWN2 MotB campaign folder before proceeding with the installation. The best way to do this is to zip it. If you make an uncompressed copy of the campaign folder you must move the copy out of the Campaigns folder. \n\nWARNING: If you do not have a back up of the campaign folder, then uninstalling the Makeover will require reinstallation of NWN2. \n\nIf you have installed the MotB SE Autopause in your override folder then you must uninstall it. It is not compatible with the Makeover and its functionality is built into the Makeover, so the override is not needed and will interfere if in the override folder. \n\nRemove any customizations you have made, if any, to your \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Night 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\\\" folder. \n\nIf you have previously modified your NWN2 MotB campaign file using the Campaign Editor plug-in (added haks for example) and do not want it overlaid then manually apply the following changes to the Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1 using the toolset Campaign Editor plug-in rather than copying over the Campaign.cam file: \n- Set PartyCreation option to true \n- Set PartyCreationSize to 6 \n- Set PartyMemberDying option to true \n- Set AllowUnrestrictedLevelUp to true \n\nNote: These instructions assume you have installed the NWN2 MotB campaign in the default locations for Windows XP. If not then you may need to adjust the target folder locations below. \n\nIt is very strongly recommended that you make a backup of your NWN2 MotB campaign folder before proceeding with the installation. The best way to do this is to zip it. If you make an uncompressed copy of the campaign folder you must move the copy out of the Campaigns folder. \n\nOpen the folder \"\\NWN2 MotB Makeover\\Put content in Campaign folder\" \nCopy all items in this folder into the folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\" \n\nOpen the folder \"\\NWN2 MotB Makeover\\Put content in campaign UI folder\" \nCopy all items in this folder into the folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign_X1\\UI\" \n\nOpen the folder \"\\NWN2 MotB Makeover\\Put content in Modules folder\" \nCopy all items in this folder into the folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Modules\" \n\nFor compatibility it is recommended that you remove all content from your Override folder while using the Makeover. Any mods that remain in your override folder will override the Makeover and may interfere with its features. \n\n----------------------- \n\nUninstall Instructions: \n\nThe only way to uninstall the Makeover is to restore your MotB campaign folder from a backup made prior to installing the Makeover. Otherwise you will need to reinstall NWN2. \n\nYou can also remove the two new X1_Makeover modules from the modules folder, but there isn't really a need as they will not interfere with anything. \n\n------------------ \n\nPatch History:\n\nAll patches must be applied in the order they were released. \n\n----------------- \nPatch 2011-02-10 updates the crafting system \n\n----------------- \nPatch 2011-02-13 corrects a game-breaking bug in the Slumbering Coven Dreamscape \n\n----------------- \nPatch 2011-05-29 corrects a bug in the crafting system that blocked the crafting of items that have no spell requirements. \n\n----------------- \nPatch 2011-11-06 corrects the blueprints for crafted poison arrows and mild poison arrows. \n\n----------------- \nPatch 2012-04-13 - This patch allows crafting to be done by Warlocks who have the Imbue Item feat and a high enough UMD; changes the calculation of spell caster level when enchanting to use class levels and the Practiced Spellcaster feat; adds scythe recipes to the medium level recipes, and adds meditate, drop unequipped inventory, and character visibility options to the player context menu.\n\n----------------- \nPatch 2012-10-12 - Further enhancements to the crafting system:\nNo longer allows enchanting unidentified items\n\nWhen specifying in a recipe that a bench is required a greater variety of text can be used as follows:\n- Requirement for a mage bench can be indicated by nx2_mage_bench, PLC_MR_MWBench, PLC_MC_CBENCH03, magical_bench, magical, or any string with \"mage_bench\" in it.\n- Requirement for an alchemy bench can be indicated by nx2_alch_bench, PLC_MR_AWBench, PLC_MC_CBENCH01, alchemy_bench, alchemy, or any string with \"alch_bench\" in it.\n- Requirement for a smith bench can be indicated by nx2_smith_bench, PLC_MR_WWBench, PLC_MC_CBENCH02, PLC_MC_WBENCH01, workbench, blacksmith, or any string with \"smith_bench\" in it.\nNote that this does not change the requirement that the actual placeable have a standard bench tag.\n\nCredit to Marc Allard and The Complete Craftsman mod by ChainsawXIV for requesting and inspiring the following enhancements regarding enchantments:\n- The CheckEnchantmentNumber function no longer counts Light, Visual effects, use limitation, inherent material bonuses, and penalizing properties against the maximum enchantment allowed number.\n- Enchantments that do not count against the number of enchantments (light, VFX, use limitation, penalizing properties) can be applied even if an item has the maximum number of properties already.\n- An item being a masterwork item no longer counts against the maximum enchantment allowed number. (masterwork items are determined by tag ending in _mast)\n- Epic casters (> 20 levels) can now add 4 enhancements to an item rather than only 3. (The level check is against the crafter, not all party members.)\n\nSpecial thanks to Marc Allard for significant help testing these modifications.\n\n-----------------\nPatch 2012-11-07\n\nChanges Spirit Essences to be consumable to regain Spirit Eater points. Volatile Spirit Essence is worth 5 points. Brilliant Spirit Essence is worth 40 points. Pristine Spirit Essence is worth 100 points.\n\nUpdate to the Makeover Guide to include information about consuming Spirit Essences\n\nRestore the standard ability to consume/destroy the Death God's Vault scribes in the Chief Scribe conversation (b07_chief_scribe.DLG), but only after Ammon Jerro has been restored \n\nMinor fixes to Makeover conversations for Neeshka (remove incorrect reference to Candlekeep, and remove term \"macho\", other minor corrections), Casavir (reword a line), and Startear (typo correction)\n\n-----------------\n","Rating":9.89,"Votes":9,"Awards":[]},"469":{"Name":"Shadows of Amn - Chapter 1 - Prison Break","Author":"Moofin","Submitted":20110201,"Updated":20110203,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dramatic, Roleplay, Twisted / Dark","Scope":"Part of Series","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Dependant on Module","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"05","Gameplay Length":"01","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Shadows of Amn - Chapter 1 - Prison Break\nLevel: 1\nClass: Any (Melee Preferred)\nRequired: Mask of the Betrayer, Storm of Zehir (Built with, may work on the original)\n\nBest to start off with a new character or pre-made one at level 1, be too easy otherwise.\n \nInstallation instructions:\n\nExtract the file into MyDocuments/NWN2/modules folder and play!\n\nknown issues:\n\nCustom items don't have icons (inventory icon image) because the toolset crashes when I open the drop-down menu on icons in the item properties window, if anyone has similar problems or even better a solution please tell me, I'd love to know.\n\nFeel free to edit/use anything in this module for your own purposes.\n\nQuick Note:\n\nThis is the first time I've tried building a module but don't let it put you off, I've thoroughly enjoyed it and there's many custom scripts (50+) which have been frustrating to build sometimes but I loved every minute and learned a hell of alot!

So any \"purists\" that \ndon't believe Barbarians can do fireballs might get upset and shouldn't play this.\n\n So I recommend a Paladin, Blackguard, Fighter, Ranger or Barbarian. This is also \njust about Monk friendly but I would recommend taking the \"good\" path as you're \nlack of armour can lead to accidents, normally fatal. A Rogue is pointless as there\nare no traps etc. I have tested this with all of the above on normal setting and \nlived to tell the tale.\n\n You will have one permanent companion, one that could be and two others are \npossible but not for too long. They are a Bard, Druid, Monk and Swashbuckler.\nThere is good reason for two having magical abilities as you will see. They all \nlike talking and have quite a lot to say for themselves. There is also a horse to \nbe found in the first module and I strongly recommend taking him along, he levels \nup too ( just press recommended and ignore his longsword abilities he's getting \nideas above his station ). Try not to lose him, he also has a part to play.\n\n One of your companions is fully romanceable ( male or female), be nice and patient \nand look out for a large bed as that will really start it ( providing you've \nexpressed an interest). If you choose to have a quick \"fling\" with another one you \nwill find your potential partner is quite understanding and doesn't mind, after all\nyou're only Human.\n\n Be warned there is a big choice in this in the first module, it's quite literally\nstaring you in the face. There is no going back from what you do, it will not make\nyour companions run away and they will change with it. But it does alter your\nconversation options and determines the ending you will get. Just be yourself and \nthink about what it actually is that you're doing. One path is definitely easier\nthan the other, you have been warned.\n\n Gameplay wise.. Conversation skills are not necessary but you will get xp for some\nwise answers. Combat skills are useful along with casting ones for your companions, \nHealing and Track can be good too. Forget the crafting department as there isn't \nany, I think that would have been banned along with the spells and I haven't got \na clue how it works.\n\n It's hard to say how dark some of the caves and dungeons are as when I play this on\nmy laptop they're bright but on my PC they're dark ! So hopefully I've got a happy\nmedium, if this gives you a problem torches are available and you're bard assistant\nis always ready with a light spell. \n\n There is roleplay in this when it matters and not lists of options on every \nconversation and some options will only be available depending on what you have done.\nSo that's why this says light. There is also the role that you play in this that is \nfar more important, all will be revealed. \n\n I think all weapons except for Quarterstaffs are catered for but having a throwing \naxe speciality would be rather silly. You can get the Exotic weapon feat for nothing\nin the second module and medium armour could help your Bard. Favoured enemies, I \nthink the most popular ones would be.. Humans, Undead and Half Orcs.\n\n I'd recommend setting your companions behaviour to.. Defend Master-ON, Follow and \nGuard Distance-NEAR. It stops them going on the rampage and saves some fighting for \nyou. Do the opposite with the horse ( OFF and FAR ) otherwise he'll get scared.\n\n Some merchants will only buy certain things, this has been done to keep prices\nreasonable and is not an attempt at reality. It also prevents you from creating an\nextremely lucrative trading business and spending all your time becoming rich.\n\n You can rest anywhere except for one area ( I had to do it to make it a challenge )\nand just so long as you have dealt with enemies beforehand or found a quiet spot. \nThere is no custom death behaviour. Respawn, reload or give up will be your options\nshould you perish, but try not to you'll upset your friends and leave a land in chaos! \n\nMany thanks for the excellent Hak Paks goes to.\n\nChimneyfish, for making some sexy women happy,\nKomuro, for making my Orcs really Orcish,\nRogue Dao, for stopping the use of telepathy by NPC's,\nDaronas, for making horses proud,\nBadMagic, for variety in women,\nSGK, for keeping Dwarves in the dark\nand Gaming Parent Studios for giving me a horse and a lot of fun with it.\n\nInstallation instructions.\n\nThis is in three parts so it's not such a big download. Unzip all three ( I use WinRar)\nand then..\n\nPart 1. put the \"A Fairy Tale\" folder in your campaign folder.\n put \"fairys.hak\" in your hak folder.\n put \"sgk_skydome_black.hak\" in your hak folder.\n put \"Credits.bik\" in your music folder ( just for end credits, not necessary if \nyou already have one in place ).\n put \"The Beginning\" in your modules folder.\n\nParts 2 and 3 are just modules and go straight in your modules folder.\n\n With regards to your override I think any appearance overrides should be fine, if \nsomeone looks a bit silly then save, take it out and reload. With regards to haks \nthat alter behaviour I haven't got a clue but you could let me know what happens.\n\n\n** For anyone interested ralebeau kindly put some portraits that suit this module on the vault ( follow the link up above ).**\n\n\n\nNow get your handsome/beautiful hero/heroine ready, there's a whole land waiting for you !","Rating":9.59,"Votes":59,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"471":{"Name":"End of legends in kingdom of Algard","Author":"Phybrizo","Submitted":20110313,"Updated":20111230,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dungeon Adventure, Roleplay, Various Settings","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"NA","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"10","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"10","Patch":"1.04","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Once a legendary hero which defeated the Lord of Shadows, King Elehnrik of Algard has died of illness a few days ago.

The village of Orlane is dying. Once a small and thriving community, Orlane has become a maze of locked doors and frightened faces. Strangers are shunned, trade has withered. Rumours flourish, growing wilder with each retelling. Terrified peasants flee their homes, abandoning their farms with no explanation. Others simply disappear...\n\nNo-one seems to know the cause of the decay - why are there no clues? Who skulks through the twisted shadows of the night? Who or what is behind the doom that has overtaken the village? It will take a brave and skillful band of adventurers to solve the dark riddle of Orlane!\n\n\nThis module is a remake of the classic 1982 TSR Dungeons & Dragons module by Douglas Niles, for a party of 4-7 characters level 1-3, ideally new first level adventurers. The odd bit here & there is different due to the limitations of the toolset (& the builder), but on the whole I've tried to keep the feel of the original.\n\n\nWHO'S IT FOR?\nThe adventure is designed for Single or Multi-players, and help is available in the starting town if any is needed to add skills, power and support to the party. \nDepending on your level, experience & play style, you may need more or less of them to help you on your way. If you're struggling, either add more characters using hte Party Editor in the Purple Sloop, add more henchman hanging around in the same place, or use a higher level character. Maximum party size is 4 player made characters + all 4 henchman + another companion from the original P&P adventure you can recruit along the way. This makes a total of 8-9 characters, so no encounter should be too tricky, although you may need to use the pause button every now & then to issue commands.\n\nPlease be aware though, Brother Gareth gets a little excited sometimes & forgets to equip his maul in his enthusiasm to get smiting. I've talked to him many times about this, but he's just too 'enthusiastic' for his own good sometimes. So if you notice in any given encounter that he's waded in bare handed, just give him a nudge & equip his weapon for him - thanks ;-)\n\n\nSTARTING THE ADVENTURE:\nThis adventure is set up as a Campaign rather than a single Module. This enables use of the Party Editor (as seen in Storm of Zehir) which allows you to create your own party (ask at the local taverns where your friends are if you can't find it).\n\nStart the adventure by choosing New & then New Campaign.\n\n\nIMPORTANT - CUSTOM CONTENT REQUIRED:\nBecause the content that comes with the original game, even with the expansion packs, is still a little limited for what I wanted to do here, I've also used various custom content HAKs, combined into a single file to download - see the links in the 'FILES' section. These include extra creatures, scenery, objects and scripts that allow cool things to happen. \n\n\nCAMPAIGN FOLDER:\nAs well as the .mod file that needs to be unzipped into your My Docs/ NWN2/ Modules folder, there's also a Campaign folder that needs to be pasted into your My Docs/ NWN2/ Campaigns folder.\n\n\nDEATH:\nPenalties seem a little harsh for low level characters, so here it doesn't incur any penalty other than a long walk back to wherever you got into trouble, but at least you won't be stuck where you died & you'll have a chance to stock up with new equipment before you head back into the fray. \n\nYour companions don't suffer that fate if they're overcome in combat - they'll merely be out cold for a few rounds, then get up & wander round a bit dazed.\n\n\nSTARTING EQUIPMENT:\nSpeaking of equipment, as this is aimed at beginning, or low level characters, you'll be given a reasonable amount of gold as you enter the adventure to kit yourself out with (maybe represeants your life savings) - spend wisely! \n\n\nCRAFTING:\nI've had a bash at implementing crafting. One of the shops in the starting town specialises in crafting materials & there's a crafting hall to get busy in. Unfortunately its a fair trek back to town if you pick up new materials along the way, so there are workbenches in different areas which should help most crafters.\n\n\nMAPPING:\nI've implemented a slightly edited version of Lance Botelle's fog of war HAK & you have a choice: Use the minimap & you'll see the usual things - namely everything regardless of whether its behind a bush or a castle wall. Use the regular map & you'll only see what's in your line of sight or have already explored. The choice is yours which you use, although the minimap obviously only has a small radius. If you use the big map, you'll also notice its hard to map when you're in combat!\n\nNOT AN MMO:\nI'm sure most players already know, but P&P style NWN2 is not an MMO, and a different approach is often useful for encounters. Running into an unknown area & hoping for the best may be fairly safe in most MMOs, but here its often a good way to get killed. If nothing else, learn to scout, look for an enemy's weakness, and hit 'pause' at the start of a fight in order to best organise your - very squishy - party.\n\nENCOUNTERS:\nThink tactically. Some opponents may be too tough for your party - before you start any fights, take a good look at the your opponent & make sure you can finish them, and maybe take a look at your environment to find the most advantageous positions to fight. And maybe save often. There's sometimes help available too - remember you're low level - one good hit & a little bad luck & you're out of the adventure!\n\nI used 4 of the available party members, TonyK's AI Override & hard core rules in playtesting & quite a few encounters were tricky, but possible with a bit of thought.\nHowever, one was downright impossible at 1st level. Hopefully this won't be too much of a spoiler, but don't mess with the law in Orlane! \n\n\nOVERRIDES - OPTIONAL, BUT MAKES PLAY BETTER (IMHO):\nI'd really recommend using TonyK's AI as it really does make a big difference in the way everyone (and every monster) behaves - find it here: Link\nAnd if you like that P&P feel - definitely make sure you turn Hard core rules on - there's nothing like seeing your fighters struggling with a bunch of goblins & wondering if they'll survive if you fire off a fireball into the melee!\n\nYou may also want to use the following:\nRearon & Trekari's Spell fixes Link\nKaedrin's PrC pack Link\nAnd if you're like me & hate the hamster ball spell effects for most protection spells, \nClubok's much needed Less obtrusive spell buffs Link\n\nAll are override files, so just unzip them into your MyDocs/Neverwinter2/Override folder & you're good to go.\n\n\nXP:\nYou DON'T get much experience for killing things. What you DO get it for is investigating successfully & discovering useful information that will help you on your quest, and for exploring. This means that whether your approach is to kill everything you come across, or circumvent it by means of charm, hold or sleep magic, or just old fashioned stealth - you'll get the same XP awards - so no class is favoured, and none penalised.\n\nOverall, XP is calculated such that a 1st level party will finish the adventure around 3rd level. This can be influenced by exploring more or less and killing more monsters, although the latter won't influence things that much.\n\n\nCONVERSATIONS:\nAs this module can be a little chat-heavy, I thought about building different communication skills into the conversations, but time constraints stopped me. I may come back to this at some point, but to be honest, I'm quite happy with how the convo's work already, and I'm itching to get cracking on my next project.\n\n\n\nCREDITS FOR CUSTOM CONTENT USED:\nGorgeous as Hochoch is, and several of the interiors of buildings therein, I can't take credit for them - They're pulled from the prefab area of the vault Link\nI'd credit the builders individually, but I've completely lost who they are - really sorry guys, but your work's awesome! \nAlso used:\nRWS all in one HAK \nLink \nThe All Critters, RWS creature convert & Misc creatures packs\nLink\nBTH Shields \nLink\nLance Botelle's Fog of War\nLink\n\n\n\nVERSION HISTORY:\nV1.1 uploaded 10.4.11\nTransition back from the Plains should work now.\nPriestess in Hochoch temple will now heal party members if you ask nicely.\nThe massive sale held by one of the vendors in Hochoch has now ended - sorry folks!\nA few of the encounters have now been weakened a little, although your main approach should be seeing the opposition before they see you & setting up the encounter to give you the advantage - or avoiding it.\nTwo of the companions available have been boosted up to level 2 - should help keep them alive a little longer.\nCaptive in the cage doesn't have an infinite loop in her conversation any more.\n\nV1.2 uploaded 14.4.11\nRemoved the teleport ring from the reptile god's temple.\nVarious other issues resolved that have been mentioned by players.\n\nV1.3 Uploaded 21.4.11\nCREATE YOUR OWN PARTY! The module is now converted to a campaign, so you can use the guest books in the 2 main inns to create your own party (up to 5 characters). If you want to, you can still add in the companions hanging around the Sloop to bolster your party - taking the maximum party size to something approaching a small army - no complaints about the fights being too hard now please :-) There's a slight issue with some messages duplicating if you're not controlling your 'original' character when they're triggered, and for some reason the active character keeps jumping back to your original character on some transitions & the occaisional trigger - which may be a little disorientating, so hope its not annoying while I'm looking for the cause. Happy Easter!\n\nV1.4 Uploaded 26.4.11\nFixed the Fog of War problems some people were reporting - Many thanks to Lance for your help with that - much appreciated!\n\nV1.5 Uploaded 15.7.11\nAdded a 'head' to the main protagonist's inventory - forces the final journal update when you pick it up in case the her death script doesn't fire properly as some players have fed back.\nNerfed the initial encounters a little as some were finding them a little too hard - OK, so maybe an ogre is a little powerful for 1st level, even a party of 8 + the local militia!\n\nV1.6 Uploaded 24.1.13\nFixed most of the few remaining bugs, added a few relatively minor features in line with the other adventures in the series.\n\nMany, many thanks to all the people who've produced the custom content that I've used, and who've helped me solve problems on this project via the vault & bioware social forums - you really are awesome & I don't think it would have all come together without you.\nThanks folks!\n\nFinally, its only my second published module for NWN & I'm still learning how to do things, but hopefully I've managed to keep a good PNP feel throughout the adventure. \nAny feedback or questions are gratefully received, so please let me know anything you liked, didn't like, or just anything at all. If its major, or just easily fixed, I'll sort it. I check in here pretty much every day, so expect a quick response.\n\nKeep rolling 20's!\n\nClyordes.\n\nPS - Next stop: Oasis of the White Palm...........\n","Rating":8.63,"Votes":22,"Awards":[]},"476":{"Name":"The Last Days of the Raven","Author":"PJ156","Submitted":20110403,"Updated":20120830,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dramatic, Various Settings","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"06","Max Character Level":"09","Gameplay Length":"05","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"icebourne\n\nThis module is the third in a series of four available on the Vault.

All that stands between Tysan and the security for his family that he has worked a lifetime to achieve. Now, as illness brings Tysan's days to a close, and Lord Nasher threatens to direct his inheritance to the temple of Lathander, the future and fortune of Tysan's family hangs in the balance. Just one document stands between Lord Tysan and the redemption he needs; a muster confirmation. Sealed with the arms of Lord Nasher himself.\n\nWith the documents long gone the quest to help Lord Tysan seems futile. Not all have lost hope however, Cleric Ormin still holds the belief that his patron can be cleared and the shadow hanging over his family lifted. The proof is there to be found but he cannot find it alone. \n\nNot twenty four hours after your fight with Taneth you are swept up by the events going on around you again.

It is important to follow these carefully as several folders have similar names.\n\nThe module will run from your campaigns start up screen.\n\n===================\nThings you should know:\n===================\n\nThere are no race restrictions and elves and dwarfs are well catered for, but humans are the order of the day.\n\nYou can start at any level, there is a little intro section that will take your character to around level 6 unless you are higher than this. All characters get some money to spend in town to ensure they are adequately equipped. Combat difficulty varies and is tough in places but if you have the NPC's provided with you then you should always prevail, particularly if you use the terrain to your advantage. \n\nYour facilitator is Ormin, if you find yourself not sure what to do and the journal does not help then you probably need to be talking to Ormin. Other npc's are carried along with the story and it is worth visiting principle protagonists as the story develops.\n\nTransitions are made without a world map. In each outdoor area you will find either a stone, a sign or an area transition that will get you out. For indoor areas use the door like everybody else.\n\nYour npc's are Ember(rogue), Honour(Mage) and Harald(fighter). \n\nHarald is optional after the first main quest is complete however, if you don't have a fighter type class I suggest you keep him with you. \n\nHonour may be dropped initially but once she joins she is there to stay. If you do drop her you can pick her up in the Market Tavern but again, once she joins she is with you till the end.\n\nYou will know how well you are treating the npc's by the way they talk to you. The less well you treat then the less you will get out of them.\n\nThe npc's have back stories which you can access as the module progresses if you have a good enough relationship with them.\n\n=======\nRomance\n=======\n\nThere are three romances in the module. Ember for Humans, Belethiel for Elves and Faralla for dwarfs. For the latter two you need to keep talking to them as the module progresses and keep and eye out for special presents :)\n\n====\nTime\n====\n\nThis mod is very time based. Shops shut at night and certain npc's are not available at certain times. Resting is restricted in places but generally you can rest where you need to. All of the innkeepers and the sundial in the market square, will allow you to pass up to 4 hours without resting so you should never be stuck waiting. Note however, at night most, if not all, npc's go to one of the inns. If they are not there then they are not plot movers. \n\nWhile in town you will hear a bell from time to time. This rings on the sixes, giving you a general idea of the time of day.\n\n==============\nWhat the mod has:\n==============\n\nThis is a linear story driven module. There are side quests but limited possibilities for sandbox style play. That said there are places to explore with rewards for doing so. Talking to every one will reveal opportunities to gain exp and the barkstrings of no core npc's will change as the story develops.\n\nThe module has a good degree of npc interaction and the npc's have back stories which will be revealed as the mod plays out.\n\n======================\nWhat this mod does not have:\n======================\n\nSoZ style conversations.\nFlexible npc hiring and firing.\n\n===========\nBig thanks bit:\n===========\n\nThanks go to the following for their parts in the making and testing of the mod.\n\nM.Reider for all his support in the development, testing and scripting for this module. Without M.R. it would not be the same module.\nQuixal for his support in play testing.\nAlupinu for his play testing support and walk mesh hints.\nAllThatJazz for her dialogue support.\nNicethugbert for his fantastic work on his eroded hills and valleys series. Two of which I use here.\nUncle FB for the Uncle FB's NPC control.\nLilac soul for the script generator � all scripts, not written by Matt, were written using this.\nRWS for the stirges model.\n\nFinally thanks to the forum users especially Chaos Weilder who helped me with all the techie bits which I can't do, which frankly is all the techie bits.\n\n=====\nMusic\n=====\n\nThere is a lot of custom music in this module much of it drawn from my developing interest in medieval music, particularly where played on original instruments. Credit is due to the following persons.\n\nFor the playing of La Manfredina which may be heard in Thunder Bay, Grien Sluis which is played in the afternoon in the market Tavern and the Trotto which in played in the Market Tavern late at night thanks to Susan Sandman and Derwent crocker. This music in played on authentic instruments and, to me, sounds great. If it sounds good to you then you can find these and other tracks on The Medieval Lady, available on Leonarda productions. I payed royalties for these tracks please do not rip them.\n\nFor the playing of The nite watch (Anthony Holborne 1545 � 1629) as played at certain times in the Red Griffin and In this trembling shadow (John Dowland 1563 � 1626) as played in the afternoon in the Market Tavern thanks to Jon Sayles. Check out his website for an enormous free resource and also develop a love for his art.\n\nAll other tracks can be found on freesound, I should credit but I can't remember the original name of the pieces. \n\nI hope you enjoy The Last Days of the Raven and hope also than you can find time to vote and comment.\n\nThanks and enjoy,\n\nPJ\n","Rating":9.63,"Votes":59,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"477":{"Name":"Baltron's Beacon","Author":"Bealzebub","Submitted":20110405,"Updated":20111008,"Category":"Single Player OR Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Module Types":"Classic PnP Conversion, Dungeon Adventure","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"05","Max Character Level":"07","Gameplay Length":"06","Categories":"classic PnP Conversion, Hack and Slash, Greyhawk","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"In 1981, I was 11 years old and in the 6th grade. One afternoon, I went to a classmate�s house after school. In the middle of his dinning room table was a mighty castle. It was about 2�x 2� and made entirely out of glued together sugar cubes. �Wow� I exclaimed! �What�s this?� My friend�s older brother smiled and asked �Have you ever played Dungeons & Dragons?� �Soon, we were whiling away the small town hours, delving into the depths of the earth and conquering the barrier peaks.\nBaltron�s Beacon harkens back to those days. It's not a globe spanning epic, or a ground breaking saga. It�s just a short dungeon crawl, 1985 style.\n\nA strangely delivered advertisement has led you to a sage named Demetrios. He needs a rare component to complete a desperately needed potion. The journy to retrieve it will take you through a large, unexplored swamp to a ruined keep, the former headquarters of a vile cult that once claimed the lives of many innocent youths.\nYou cautiously accept the mission. But who knows what monsters lurk in the vast marsh? Are the old ruins occupied, perhaps by things even more dangerous than the previousl residents? Beware, for the eerie green light shining upward from the central tower, the beacon that guides your way, may attract others as well. To succeed, you must penetrate the keep and find a unique Black Flame worshipped by the old cult. Could those evil ones be lurking about still? You will know soon...\nTo solve the mysteries of Baltron's Beacon, you must excel in handling wilderness, building ruins, dungeons, traps, puzzels, and monsters. \n\n\nPlayer- Single or multi-player.\n\nLevel- 5-7. New players leveled to 6. finish at 8 or 9.\n\nGame play- Hack and slash. Don�t look for any mushy romances, or intellectual orations.\n\nPlay time- About 6 hours.\n\nCompanions- There are 4 possible companions, any 3 selectable at a time. Fighter, rogue, wizard, and Cleric.\n\nResting- You and EACH companion gets one rest every 8 game hours. Use them wisely. (switch characters before resting.)\n\nCrafting- Standard OC crafting is used. \n\nDeath- Companions will revive to 1 hp after the fight. The main PC will have to be revived, so make sure you have some heal kits or a cleric. If the whole party dies, it�s reload time, so save often.\n\nSoZ and MotB are required to play. \n\nThe .hak version of;\nHeed's PC Tools- Link\nInterior Floor Texture Pack 01- Link\nare also required.

At some point you will pick up a henchman who will help you on your way, but later you will \nnot need him. As expected with these types of adventures, you will pick up a few companions who will follow \nyou to the adventures end, and they will be well needed when the time comes. I played around with some of the \ncharacters having sound and trying to deal with lip-syncing. Just take into account that I�m the only voice \ntalent and you can only do so much with software and my low-end audio equipment. Overall I think I did ok \nwith my level of experience, but try not to judge to hard. As stated before you do need to have your sound \non since one of the puzzles involves sound.\n\nKnown Bugs\n\nNear the end of the adventure there are a number of colored doors that are password protected. When you \ngive the right password the door will open. Do not pass into the doorway until you close the dialog box \nby clicking [Continue]. This will help avoid any glitches with triggers and scripts.\n\nThere is a secret door that is hidden by a bookshelf. After a DC check the thief in your party is \nsupposed to start a conversation with the main character. It works about 25% of the time when the DC \ncheck is met. Its not important to the overall adventure and destroying the bookshelf will show the door \nif all else fails.\n\nLip-syncing sometimes times out before the audio. First time trying to add audio and lip-syncing. I think if I\nwould have shortend up some of my conversation lines I would not have had such a problem as I did. Live and learn.\n\nI keep finding typos, but I do not have the time and resorces to fix them all. Try to remember that I'm only a C+\nwriter and have never claimed to have a degree in english.\n\n\nContinued adventure awaits at the conclusion of the module if you wish. I�ve added a file listed as \nNames and Places to Search.txt. These are some of the names of the characters you will meet and some of \nthe places you will visit. If you get a chance, do an online search of the names and see what you learn.\nIts funny what you find when you google some of this stuff. \n\nThanks to:\n\nKrondorl's D&D Monsters Compilation\n\nLilac Soul's Script Generator\n\nFXE Generator Tool by 0100010\n\nTons of advice by members on the NWN2 BioWare forums.

The others are:\n\nSheep and Stone.\nThe Caravan Club.\nThe last days of the Raven.\nThese Dark Days of Waiting.\nFrom This Comes Strength.\n\nThe series will be six modules in length, the fifth of which is work in progress. All will appear under the \n\ncampaign title of Tales from the Lake of Sorrows, late in 2012.\n\nPlease enjoy the modules and don't forget to vote :)\n\nThese Dark Days of Waiting.\n\nThunder Bay has a new Lord and you have a new employer. Despite the promise of rest and recuperation he has one more job for you to do before you can settle down in front of that log fire for a few weeks.\n\nHal Tysans life is in turmoil, just hours ago he was the only child of a dying father and a loving mother. In the intervening time his father has died, his mother has left his side and he has discovered he is not an only child. His elder half brother is dead, killed at the hands of yourself and your party and his younger half sister is living in a small village somewhere on the outskirts of the lands belonging to Crossroads keep.\n\nAnd there, adventurer, is where you come in ... Hal Tysan wants his sister back, preferably alive this time, and you are to go and get her. As ever you have help but with Honour returned to her stepfather, Solace persuing her own goals and Harald facing the justice of Lord Nasher in Neverwinter your friends are looking thin on the ground. \n\nStill; all you have to do is travel a few days to Crossroads Keep, pick up a five year old girl and bring her back. That can't be hard ..... Can it?\n\n\n\nLocation Forgotten realms � in the area of Neverwinter.\n\nSetting The module is set at the same time as SoZ against a backdrop of hard times in Neverwinter brought on by the war with the King of Shadows. It starts two hours after the last module �The last Days of the Raven� concludes.\n\nPlay time 3 - 4 hours\nLevel 9 - 10\nClass Any\nCompanions 2\n\nThis is module four in the series Tales from the lake of sorrows. The story starts just a few hours after the ending in The Last Days of the Raven and carries on with the story threads from that module. \n\nThis is a linear story led mod, there are some side quests and conversations which boost your exp but this is not a sandbox mod by any means. There is some exploring to be done and rewards for doing so.\n\nNote on combat � Unless you are an experienced tactical player keep all the companions with you, the combat is balanced to be challenging at times but with preparation and tactics none of the encounters will be too difficult to manage. Rogues and, to some degree, bards especially should keep plentiful potions to hand and ensure that Alan Baxter is well equipped.\n\nNote on npc's � If you pass time in the keep or Thunder Bay and the npc's do not appear then walk into a building and out and all should be well.\n\n=====================\nLoading instructions.\n=====================\n\nLoading instructions are included in the zipped file. It is important to follow these carefully.\n\nThe module will run from your campaigns start up screen.\n\n=======================\nThings you should know:\n=======================\n\nThere are no race restrictions but humans are the order of the day. Ember may now be romanced by any character and any sex. The opening convo will allow you to define your relationship with Ember as you will see in the conversation nodes.\n\nYou can start at any level, there is a little intro section that will take your character to around level 9 unless you are higher than this. All characters get some money to spend in town to ensure they are adequately equipped. \n\nCombat difficulty varies and is tough in places but if you have the NPC's provided with you then you should always prevail, particularly if you use the terrain to your advantage. \n\nThe story is carried by some of the main npc's but there is no main facilitator as per previous mods. \n\nCheck your journal if you get lost as to what to do. \n\nYou are going to recognise some of the key players if you have played the OC. Talk to the main npc's for a side quest or two. \n\nTransitions are made without a world map. \n\nIn each outdoor area you will find either a stone, a sign or an area transition that will get you out. For indoor areas use the door like everybody else.\n\nYour npc's are Honour(Mage) and Alan(fighter). \n\nHonour may be dropped initially but once she joins she is there to stay.\n\nYou will know how well you are treating the npc's by the way they talk to you. The less well you treat then the less you will get out of them.\n\n=======\nRomance\n=======\n\nThe romance with Ember is developed in the last module. You may pick it up in this module by picking the lilac lines in the opening sequence. \n\nNote: the conversation with the innkeeper is you set up convo for this mod. When you are asked how many rooms you want your answer will set your relationship with Ember for this module. It will be clear what I mean in the module.\n\n====\nTime\n====\n\nThis mod is very time based. Shops shut at night and certain npc's are not available at certain times. Resting is restricted in places but generally you can rest where you need to. All of the innkeepers and the sundial in the market square, will allow you to pass up to 4 hours without resting so you should never be stuck waiting. Note however, at night most, if not all, npc's go to one of the inns. If they are not there then they are not plot movers. \n\nWhile in Thunder Bay you will hear a bell from time to time. This rings on the sixes, giving you a general idea of the time of day.\n\n=================\nWhat the mod has:\n=================\n\nThis is a linear story driven module. There are side quests but limited possibilities for sandbox style play. That said there are places to explore with rewards for doing so. Talking to everyone will reveal opportunities to gain experience. \n\nThe module has a good degree of npc interaction; talk to them and they will talk right back :) Alan Baxter in particular can fill in some blanks on the other npc�s if you raise your standing with him.\n\n============================\nWhat this mod does not have:\n============================\n\nSoZ style conversations.\nFlexible npc hiring and firing.\n\n===============\nBig thanks bit:\n===============\n\nThanks go to the following for their parts in the making and testing of the mod.\n\nM.Reider - for all his support in the development, testing and scripting for this module.\n\nArkalzelth - for his play testing and advice on character builds.\n\nUncle FB - for the Uncle FB's NPC control.\n\nLilac soul - for the script generator � all scripts, not written by M.R, were written using this.\n\nRWS - for the creature models.\n\nFinally thanks to the forum users who helped with my questions, _Knightmare_ and Chaos Wielder in particular.\n\nSorry if I have missed anyone I do not intend to offend.\n\n=====\nMusic\n=====\n\nThere is a lot of custom music in this module. Credit is due to the following persons.\n\nFor the playing of La Manfredina which may be heard in Thunder Bay thanks to Susan Sandman and Derwent crocker. This music in played on authentic instruments and, to me, sounds great. If it sounds good to you then you can find this track on The Medieval Lady, available on Leonarda productions. I payed royalties for these tracks please do not rip them.\n\nFor the playing of the many guitar tracks used in the taverns and inns of my modules thanks to Jon Sayles. Check out his website for an enormous free resource and also develop a love for his art.\n\nAll of the area music may be found on freesound, the composer, in whole or in part, of all the tracks I use is Tillman Sillescu, big thanks to him for his art and for making the music freely available. \n\nI hope you enjoy These Dark Days of Waiting and hope also than you can find time to vote and comment.\n\nThanks and enjoy,\n\nPJ\n","Rating":9.36,"Votes":32,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"496":{"Name":"Online Adventures","Author":"Darin L, various others","Submitted":20111014,"Updated":20111121,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Classic PnP Conversion","Scope":"Small","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"01","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Not finished (but wanted to get out what I had)\n\nThis is a module that was intended as a way for me to learn C++ by writing NWN2 content based on preexisting adventures.\n\nSo I went to:\nLink\n\nAnd began modding.\nSo Far, it starts you off with A dark and Stormy Knight, using the Storm-Peace to allow you to build a party from provided NPCs (Female Elven Wizard, Male Human Fighter, Female Human Cleric of Sune, and a Female Half-Elf Rogue).\n\n\nQuests Coded\n-A Dark and Stormy Knight\n-The Burning Plague\n-Something's cooking\n\nCurrent Notes: Town was found in the prefabs (mountain village)\n\nOriginal Intention was to do the vast majority of them and link them as a campaign, but I'm beginning to lose interest (has been weeks since I worked on it). kept what I had and finished up Something's Cooking because it was mostly done.

You also hear rumours of an ancient tomb newly discovered � could the two be connected? Other adventurers have already ventured to seek the tomb�s treasures - would you care to join them?\n\nThis adventure is a classic aD&D dungeon crawl first published in White Dwarf 9, way back in 1978 and republished in Best of White Dwarf Scenarios 1, written by the late Albie Fiore, converted to NWN2 by Clyordes. According to Wikipedia, it was the first full adventure ever published in White Dwarf, so I guess its kinda historical, but for me it�ll always hold great memories as one of the first adventures I ever ran once I got a copy of this weird new game �Basic D&D� & convinced a group of friends to give it a go�.\n\nWho�s it for? \n2-4 Characters, levels 3-4. Just add more or higher level characters (or companions) if you're struggling. If you�ve played through �Against the Cult of the Reptile God�, this is designed to be a short follow-on adventure for the same characters. Another short adventure will follow, to get characters up to the right level to attempt a remake of �Oasis of the White Palm� which is also buried deep in the toolset at the moment.\n\nHow long will it take? \nUnlike Reptile God, this isn�t that long � its just one dungeon. Allow a good evening of 3-4 hours to play through it. It�ll take more if you�re cautious & less if you run in like a bull in a china shop (assuming you don�t die & have to run back from Hochoch too many times � see �Death�)\n\nExperience: \nAs in my previous adventures, little XP is given for killing monsters � so if your play style is not hack & slash, you won�t be penalised here. Instead, Experience is gained from completing quests, which you can do any way you like, and if you complete them all (there�s one main quest and 3-4 subquests that you can pick up in the local tavern), you�ll be around mid level 4 by the time you finish. \n\nDeath: \nResurrects you back in the starting town. If you don�t like what could be a long walk - remember to save often, or adventure cautiously. Or use the chance to stock up on equipment.\n\nResting: \nUnlimited, apart from when there�s monsters right next door � the denizens of the Lichway hate to give adventurers too much peace.\n\nMapping:\nLance�s mapping hak is implemented here � which only allows you to see where you�ve been on the main (screen filling) map. Although if you want to �overrule� this, the minimap is unaffected.\n\nCustom content: \nThis adventure uses the HAK you�ve already used in Reptile God � there�s not much more to download if you�ve already played that adventure � just the following:\nThe Lichway.mod file\nThe Lichway campaign file\nThe Lichway.hak file\nThe Crystalmist.hak file if you haven't still got it from Reptile God.\nIf you haven�t already played the Reptile God adventure, you really ought to, as it came out really well & is designed as the first adventure for a band of new characters which continue their travels here. All the same, if you haven�t played it, you�ll need all of the files listed below.\n\nMake your own party: \nLike Reptile God, this adventure has been set up as a campaign, allowing you to adventure with a party of your own characters if you wish � just ask at the local inn to find out where the other members of your party are (& remember you need the campaign file below & choose �Start new Campaign� when you start Neverwinter up).\n\nCredits: \nMany thanks to the mighty RWS for their custom tiles, placeables & creatures which I used in the dungeon, and all the other builders of creatures, prefabs (such as the base town I used for Hochoch) out there � you�re a great group & can�t take enough credit!\n\nUpdate history:\n30th December 2011 - New version uploaded, fixes a couple of minor issues that players have noticed - should be a final version now, but shout up if anything's not right.\n\n24th January 2013 - Added a new area between Hochoch and the Lichway, changed a few features in line with the other adventures in the campaign.\n\n\nDedication:\nThis adventure was originally written for White Dwarf magazine by Albie Fiore - one of many things he did in D&D's early days. Accidentally coming across his obituary a couple of months ago was what got me wanting to remake it for NWN. \n\nSo this is for you, Albie - although I never knew you, you sound like a great bloke & you write a great adventure - hope I did it justice.\nLink \n\n\nClyordes.\n","Rating":8.5,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"498":{"Name":"Wulverheim","Author":"Shockwolf","Submitted":20111130,"Updated":20130216,"Category":"Single Player OR Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Module Types":"City Adventure, Combat, Deathmatch Arenas, Dungeon Adventure, Forest Adventure, Humorous/Parody, Mountain Adventure, Persistent Worlds, Roleplay, Temple / Crypt Adventure, Uses Stone of Recall / Town Portal","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Large","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"60","Categories":"Action Roleplay Adventure, Virtual World.","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"REQUIRES EXPANSIONS Mask of The Betrayer and Storm of Zehir OR the Platinum Edition.\n\nVisit the Wulverheim Wiki for most of your gameplay information requirements.

Like the page in order to keep up with news.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nWulverheim is a Neverwinter Nights 2 Campaign Module inspired by The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Experience a beautifully hand crafted Sandbox open world and game play concepts never before seen in Neverwinter Nights. Live another life in another world, create and play any character you can imagine, from the noble knight paladin to the sinister cult blackguard. \n\nExplore the province of Wulverheim, and talk to the locals. See what troubles them and help them for rewards or simply cause whatever mayhem your dark heart desires.\n\nOne thing will lead to the next, but where will it end? \n\nYour Fame and Fortune or Your Doom?\n\n\nAlthough this is a fully released and playable version of Wulverheim, please bare in mind that it is still work in progress. Many more quests and areas do need to be added and you may notice this as you play. Despite not being finished, Wulverheim is considered to be a very well polished game, but still, I cannot guarantee there will not by any bugs and errors. Any problems that you encounter might be able to be fixed in up coming versions, so please raise any issues you find in the forum.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nAdaptive Encounters to challenge any Character level, Crafting, House purchasing, Own a horse to quickly travel between towns, Equipment storage accessible from any bank and player house (KEMO), Diplomacy, Bluff, Intimidate, Party creation, Cohort recruitment, High magic, Joinable Guilds, many quests, skill buffs through paid training, sleep in beds to pass the time and refresh your character, exploration, large dungeon crawls, random loot and Criminal records that have consequences.\n\n\nCoop/Multiplayer\n\nWulverheim should be compatible with multiplayer, ideally as a coop with a small group of friends who are working as a party.\n\nIt is very important that you take the following information into consideration before attempting to play Wulverheim as a multiplayer, else you could get on your fellow players nerves... \n\nFirstly you might be glad to know that playing Wulverheim Online or over a LAN is nothing like playing the OC that way. You will not be forced in to viewing other players Cinematic Conversations and you will not be teleported beside other players when they move from area to area. You can all go your separate ways within limits...\n\nBecause of the limitations of Neverwinter Nights 2 itself, it can only run 1 module at a time and this includes hosting Multiplayer games. Because Wulverheim is so large it needs to be split into multiple modules in order to run in a stable manner, be optimised and speedy. Think of a module as a Zone full of various areas including terrain, towns, interiors and dungeons e.t.c. If you or one of your fellow players leaves a module to go to the next module (This is called Transitioning), NWN2 will unload the current module, load the next module, and will move ALL of the players connected to the game with the player that made the move. That's not to say you can't go back to the previous module, because you can. However it will be very irritating for a player who is trying to turn in a quest for a reward or shopping at the Blacksmith, only to get whisked away from it, because a careless player exited the module to move to the next, wouldn't you agree?\n\nFor this reason I will let you know which Modules or \"Zones\" Wulverheim has been divided into for your information. This way players can consult their map, the list below and can know which Zone they are in before they attempt to cross into another Zone. Ideally you will want agree with your fellow team mates before its time to move on.\n\nWulverheim is split up into 12 Modules or \"Zones\" and they are:\n\nBrockbank Bay\nCounty Gallimere\nJaggatooth Mountains\nKrypdyr Marsh\nCounty Liascelyn\nOaknest Forest\nRiver Burly Griffin\nThe Gull Coast\nThe Slegge Crags\nVeiskille River\nWelwyn Valley\nWulverberg\n\n\nPlease note that I have not tested this version of Wulverheim in multiplayer. If you have any problems, please raise it in the forum.\n\n\nInstallation and Requirements\n\nBefore installing Wulverheim please make sure that any previous versions of Wulverheim have been uninstalled and that the Override folders are empty in both the Neverwinter Nights 2 folders:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override (By default)\n\nAnd\n\nMy Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override\n\nIt is possible that if you have overrides installed that are not a part of Wulverheim, then game crashes, strange in game behaviour and bugs can occur. Wulverheim has a lot of custom content that may conflict with any you have installed your self.\n\nNOTE: If you still wish to keep what is in your override folder for other modules then an easy way around this is to rename the Override folder to something else like; Override(1). Then you can create a new empty Override folder for Wulverheim before you install it. When switching back and playing your other modules you can then rename the new Override folder (for Wulverheim) as Override(2) and then rename Override(1) back to Override. Just like flipping a switch!\n\nTo install Wulverheim simply double click the installer exe file that you downloaded and follow the instructions. It will install all of the necessary files and folders the appropriate destination in the �My Documents� folder. Please do not change the directory otherwise Wulverheim will not work.\n\nWARNING: Some files in your My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder may be overwritten. It would be a good idea to back up any custom content in these folders that you may want to keep. This is just in case any of it gets replaced with a different version included in the Wulverheim package. Saved games, other modules and local vault characters should be safe during this installation.\n\nRequirements And Things To Be Aware Of:\n\nWulverheim works best on Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate Edition and XP Pro 32-bit Edition. However it hates Windows XP 64-bit and Vista 64-bit with a passion. Expect regular transition crashes if you use those two Operating Systems.\n\nWulverheim is also very graphics intensive compared to that of the Original NWN2 Campaigns. I highly recommend a powerful gaming PC. Something above the original recommended specifications of NWN2. \n\nBest advice I can give you is to turn off as many background applications as possible when playing Wulverheim. I can highly recommend that you download and use a free app called G-Boost to help you with this.\n\n\n\n\nNote to other Developers: \n\nI have removed the TRN files from Wulverheim as they are purely toolset files and are not needed to play. This also decreases the overall package size for download. As a result you will not get much if you try to open my areas in the toolset. If you enjoy pilfering prefabs then I will recommend my prefab package, here.\n\n\n\nDo You Have Trouble Downloading Huge Files? \n\nWell now... you best get Free Download Manager then!\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAlthough he has done his best to make sure that this file is malware free and that it installs without destructiveness, Shockwolf the author of Wulverheim takes no responsibility for any data damage or loss, viruses, spyware, hair loss, wart growth or any horrible disease contracted during or after the installation of this campaign module for Neverwinter Nights 2. If you install Wulverheim then you do so at your own risk. Please bear in mind that only good intentions were made during the process of developing Wulverheim. \n\nI really hope you enjoy playing Wulverheim and do so for a very long time. \n\n\n\nUpdate 1.08\n\n*Players with a Murder Record now need to watch out for Bounty Hunters. \n*Changed all barrels to contain food only.\n*Changed the perception range on all enemies. The Default setting is bugged and behaves like long range and they seemed to have X-Ray vision. Now enemies should only attack when within an acceptable distance from the player and no longer see and hear through walls. Animals will only attack if you get very close.\n*Added more areas for later quests.\n\n\nUpdate 1.07\n\n*Increased the minutes per Game Hour from 3 to 6 minutes. So, 6 minutes now = 1 in Game Hour.\n*Created a Gnomish invention, a fascinating contraption full of complex cogs and springs, called a Clock. It has the amazing ability to tell you what time it is during the day. \nUsing this clock will allow you to wait anywhere (Pass time by). They are now available at all General Goods Stores.\n* Changed the Sequence Lever Puzzles. They are no longer randomly generated, they now have clues nearby and flaming consequences for pulling the levers in the wrong order. \n*Lowered the treasure class on big locked chests as they were giving out too much loot. Boss chests remain the same.\n*Made it possible to join more than one guild at a time. Usual qualifications still apply.\n*Fixed a problem with the Betrayers of the Church quest, where all Werewolf teeth collected would be removed and only one reward given.\n*More areas added for later quests.\n\n\nUpdate 1.06\n\n*Tweaked the Knock spell to work on the indestructible doors that don�t require keys to open.\n*Fixed the Party Quest XP distribution for the Magic Shop Purukian Relic quests.\n*Adjusted access to the mineshaft in Boltwood mine to make it easy to get to by simply clicking on it.\n*Adjusted the triggers in the rental Inn rooms that unlock the doors when you approach them. Some players were getting trapped. \n\n\nUpdate 1.05\n\n*Corrected a few script functions that were causing the Cohorts to duplicate, use lines of conversation at the wrong time and spawn at every Inn when they shouldn't be.\n*Made weapon and armour racks that generate random weapons and armour that are not too overpowered. These have been added to some of the existing dungeon areas.\n*Increased how often random weapons and armour are dropped by human, elf and dwarf enemies.\n*Recreated the mining system. All types of metal can be mined from veins of ore now. One of each special type are placed in the game, but Iron veins will be very common and can be found in nearly every mine. Veins of Ore will now require a Pickaxe to mine, which can be bought from any Blacksmith. Raw Ore can be taken to a contraption called a Smelter to smelt them in to ingots. Smelters can be found outside of every blacksmith building/Chapel of Moradin. \n\nUpdate 1.04\n\n*Fixed the distribution of Damage XP amongst party members when controlling a non party leader member.\n*Fixed some creatures that were not levelling up when they were supposed to.\n*Fixed the scaling scripts on creatures that were not working if the party leader was not selected.\n\nUpdate 1.03\n\n*Prevented the creatures that are not supposed to scale to the players from scaling to the players. This was due to the new changes to heartbeat scripts that double checks that the creatures are levelling up to the player. \n*Decreased the maximum random loot value dropped by regular enemies from 500,000gp back down to 800gp. Boss enemies are the only ones now capable of dropping more valuable loot. \n*Boss enemies should now give more death XP than regular enemies.\n*Hogarth Crypt has been built.\n\n\nUpdate 1.02\n\n*Tweaked the encounters in Blacktooth Cave and Adamantine Caves to speed up the progress. \n*Added a bonus treasure room with a puzzle to Blacktooth Cave. \n*Added a puzzle to the Adamantine Caves and a couple of plot related surprises.\n*Fixed the Veins of Ore so that they respawn instantly and work on all party members. You can now mine them as much as you like, which was the original intention.\n*Added some changes to Rockpoint cave: Reduced the encounters to speed up the pace, added a door that needs a key and added an area related bonus quest to encourage more incentive to kill the Orc chieftain, other than the large gold and XP reward from the Duke that is already in place. \n*When you respawn at the Void of Gates, ALL party members should now resurrect. \n*Decreased how often enemies drop loot from 50% to 25%. \n*Fixed the �Finding the Thieves Guild� quest not firing in the Beggar conversations.\n*Fixed the 'Wulverheim's Most Wanted\" quest not firing in Lieutenant Herstein's Conversation. \n*When starting a new game, new characters should now receive 200 gold pieces and a Gem of Defibrillation.\n\n\nUpdate 1.01\n\n*Fixed the �Neglected Pets� quest from stopping Level 4 and higher characters from turning in the quest.\n*Fixed the �Finding the Thieves Guild� quest not firing in the Shady Looking Characters conversation.\n*Fixed a door transition on the Helmite Monastery in Wulverberg Outskirts NW. \n*Fixed all of the Purukian Relics, so they can be taken from the statues. \n\n\nSpecial thanks and credits to:\n\nJeremy Soule for the Oblivion soundtrack.\nMrs Shockwolf for being an advisor, fountain of useful knowledge and supportive of my time on this project.\nTiclaDesign for adding his personal touch to a few of my areas.\nZylch000 and Aleanne for the Sexy Female Clothing Package overrides.\nRazare for the sittable chairs.\nAshura for the new Visual Effects.\nDaves World for the placeable respawning system.\nTani for the TerraCoppa Toolset plugin and the NWN2packer tool\nSir Elric for the NWN1 Random Respawning Traps.\nDaelos for the script that locks doors at night.\nCharlie for the Item Appearance Changer.\nCdaulepp for the random loot system.\nNeilMC for the detailed high-resolution floorboards.\nLord Badmagic and Serene for the ladies makeup texture.\nSoya and Ren for most of the new Hairstyles.\nBarrel of Monkeys for a few of the longer hair styles.\nBarrel of Monkeys and RunnerDuck for the Shirtless Saga Armor Pack Volume 1 v1.1\nArPharazon for the Angry monster transition script.\nDragoon001 for the Warlock Outfit Fix\nKnightmare, Bioware and various members of the NWN community for the classic NWN icons.\nHellcow/Spajk for the Cobwebs\nLilac Soul for their Script Generator\nNeshke Narovken and co. for NESS (Extendable Spawn System)\nErik Breau of Europa for sharing scripts and ideas.\nAlleyslink for their door lever scripts\nMister_Leebo for his sequence lever puzzle scripts\nKEMO for their storage system\nLink for their accent translation\nBounce for the Beholder, Minotaur and Werewolf models.\nWho ever made the Optimised Spell Buff FX.\n\nIf I have used some work that I have forgotten to mention here then please let me know so I can add them.\n\nWithout the amazing contributions the NWN community has given, Wulverheim may not have been possible.\n","Rating":9.81,"Votes":26,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"499":{"Name":"Nihil Trilogy II: Chains of Misfortune(Beta-Version 006)","Author":"seraphimsage1","Submitted":20111218,"Updated":20120203,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dramatic, Twisted / Dark","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Nonexistent","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Light","Min Character Level":"08","Max Character Level":"14","Gameplay Length":"04","Categories":"Beta Version\nStory\nIdentity\nAnimism","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Beta: Nihil Trilogy Part 2 of 3\nChains of Misfortune (Version 006)\n(Beta Testing Has Ended)\n\n//Beta Has Ended////////////////////\n\nThe Final Version has been released.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////\n------------------------------------\nInstallation:\n\nStep 1\nUse 'Winrar' or '7-zip' or other extractor to extract the '(Beta_Version_006)-Nihil_Trilogy_II_Chains_Of_Misfortune_006beta' Folder from the zip file.\n\nStep 2\nOpen the Extracted Folder\n\nStep 3\nCut and Paste the 'nihilhaks.hak' and place it into the folder under\n'My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/hak'\n\nStep 4\nCut and Paste the '(Beta_Version_006)-Nihil_Trilogy_II_Chains_Of_Misfortune_006beta.mod' module and place it into the folder under\n'My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/modules'\n\nStep 5\nStart up the Neverwinter Nights 2 game and choose the option called New Game Modules, and select the '(Beta_Version_006)-Nihil_Trilogy_II_Chains_Of_Misfortune_006beta.mod' module\n\nStep 6\nPick any character you wish or re-import your character from the last game(some key mementos will remain), then start up the game.\n\nStep 7\nReport back any glitches, bugs, grammatical errors(try to be specific), and anything else you find out of place and I'll attempt to repair those before the release.\n\n\n-------------------------------------\nSetting:\n\nYou can play your own role, that of another, or mix them up, all is open to an Asper.

Invocations mostly use CHA, but some use INT as additional. Arcane spells mostly INT, but certain spells use CHA to determine their damage. Divine and Nature spells use WIS, but certain Spells use CHA, even INT to determine their effectiveness.\n\n- Crafting:\n\nCrafting is done by interacting with certain objects like forge, anvil, sawhorse, etc. Certain skills are required to be able to craft items successfully except for cooking and baking which are TfG. Certain crafting objects require fuels to operate, for example, forge requires coals to operate, anvil is located adjacent to forge, to be able to use anvil, the forge has to be activated first, using forge to smelt ores into ingot deactivates it and makes anvil unusable so the forge has to be reactivated to have the anvil usable, but using anvil to craft weapons doesn't deactivate the forge, you can use anvil anytime as long as the forge is active. Cooking and baking don't need skills but they need firewood(faggot, or is it fagot? sorry I don't speak english) to activate.\n\n- Class:\n\nAdded new spells and 3 more levels to Warlock's spellbook so warlock has 7 instead of only 4, with limited choice of arcane/divine spells at the last 3 levels, sorcerers and warlock can learn more spells, warlock gain spells faster, gain EB at every level and maxed at 14 instead of 20.\n\n- Weapon:\n\nSling is not supposed to be exist, it is replaced with revolver, but uses the same ammo as sling.\n\n\nCREDITS\n-------\n\nThanks to many of them who have provided custom contents, I may forget somebody here, but I'm trying to credit all of them with all respect.\n\n - Aleanne\n - Aleph\n - Amraphael\n - ArPharazon\n - Art E Choke\n - Arsan\n - Alban\n - Argyl \n - Antenni\n - ACME Team\n - AP\n - Adonnay\n - Alupinu\n - Bad Magic\n - Barrel of Monkey\n - Baron\n - Barry the Hatchet\n - BehNoosh\n - Bounce Studios\n - Casa\n - Camb\n - Chimneyfish\n - CacySunLee\n - Daughter of Guns\n - Dr. Steam\n - Dobbs\n - EltuurKomChatka\n - Ephraellia\n - Escrimator\n - Evil Edison\n - Fenril\n - Gaming Parents Studio\n - Glee\n - Heed\n - Honey Mill\n - Hellcow\n - Hellfire\n - Human_Male\n - IdKrr\n - Jester\n - Jhonny Rhee\n - John McA\n - Kaedrin\n - Kemo\n - Krighaur\n - Kurogo\n - Loki1234\n - Mae Be\n - MWM Dragon\n - Mr. British\n - NavetSea\n - Necrolord\n - Noah\n - Nytir\n - Orlondow\n - Paladin3333\n - P-Tow\n - Ren\n - Robinson workshop\n - Rogue Dao\n - RB\n - Schazzwozzer\n - SDJ\n - Shtoss\n - Shaughn78\n - Serenity Frost\n - Soya\n - Somebody/All of them I missed here\n - Tarim\n - Tony K\n - Tupoun\n - Ugly Duck\n - Uncle FB\n - Viola\n - V3Par\n - VPJ\n - Whatbrick\n - Xaltar\n - Yaddaman\n - Zpirit\n - Zylch\n\n\n - Music Tracks:\n - Motoi Sakuraba - Valkyrie Profile OST.\n - Kenji Ito, Tsuyoshi Sekito - Romancing Saga OST.\n\n\nHINT & TIPS\n------------\n\nSPOILER but IMPORTANT!!\n\n - Whatever, it is important to do what your neighbor asks first once you're outside, doing this quest later could prevent you from advancing the plot if you're greedy type, you know what I mean.\n\nPOLYMORPH SPELLS BEWARE!!\n\n - Polymorph spell like Word of Changing DESTROYS your currently equipped item EXCEPT accessories(rings and amulets), weapons and ammo, it has to be made like this since unequip command doesn't work on polymorph, due to its limitation(probably) it appears that the engine keep your last CURRENT appearance permanently as your default appearance (have no idea why) instead of returning to the original default appearance, it happens when the polymorph form is the same type with the default appearance of the character but in different variations, the word of changing in this mod actually tranforms you to a \"she-hulk\" version, if you don't want to lose your items, make sure to unequip them first before polymorphing.\n \n\n=====================================================================\n\nNKT88\n\n\n\n == MERRY X-MAS & HAPPY NEW YEAR ==\n \n====================================================================== \n\n ","Rating":7.08,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"501":{"Name":"North of the Moonsea","Author":"Hilltop2012","Submitted":20111230,"Updated":20120214,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"","Scope":"NA","Content":"Everyone","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"07","Gameplay Length":"08","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"Motb and Soz expansions are Required.\n\n The land north of the Moonsea is a treacherous place.

Multi-classing will also work and there are a few items which a \nSpellsword or Eldrich Knight may find useful.\n\n\nTHIS IS A SEQUEL:\n\nThis is a sequel to The Wizard's Apprentice. If you have not played The Wizard's Apprentice, I recommend that you do so before starting The Wizard's Apprentice Chapter II. \n\nThe Wizard's Apprentice Page\n\nCHARACTER SELECTION:\nIt is ideal that you still have your character that you exported at the end of the first chapter. I recognize that this was some time ago, so there is an option in the game lobby to level a new character up to the appropriate level. You also will receive some important items from the first chapter to bring along for the second. If you do have to level up your character, it is important that you put the scrolls provided in your spellbook, or you may find the first few areas more difficulty than they are intended to be. \n\nLEVELING:\n\nThe starting level is intended at midway through level 4. If you complete all quests and maximize your experience points, you will end at level 12. It is possible that if you do not completely explore all areas and complete all siedquests you will end at level 11. \n\nDIFFICULTY SETTINGS:\n\nI received many comments that The Wizard's Apprentice Chapter I was too difficult. I have tried to remedy this by providing companions and ample items to assist you in your quests. I recommend that players who are not confident in their wizarding abilities or who have little experience with playing a spellcasting class should play on easy or normal setting. More experienced players will probably find Hardcore setting more challenging and fun. During development, I balanced combat to be challenging on Hardcore settings, so if you find normal settings to be too easy, you may consider changing them. \n\nTACTICS:\n\nI have set up terrain and encounters so that tactics can make battles much easier. Spellcasters have access to spells which allow them to move unseen and approach enemies without their knowledge. Use these abilities as well as the terrain and anything you find in your environment to your advantage. Some battles may be very difficult to win if you do not use good tactics. A clever wizard always looks for an easier way to win a battle. There are several instances where there are assets that a clever wizard could use to his or her advantage. Of course there is always the hard way for you fireball-slingers out there. \n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTION\n\nI have taken great pains to make the environment more interactive. You will interact with your environment in ways you never have in NWN2. Pay close attention and you will find some pleasant and and very useful surprises. \n\n**NOTE** Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm and Isaac's Greater Missile Storm will not damage placeables and will not work with the environmental objects the way other spells will. This is due to the way the spells were scripted, which is very complex and I decided it was too dangerous to modify the script as it could create bizarre bugs.\n\nSPELL TARGETING\n\nYou can target a spell at your currently selected target only if your currently selected target is a creature, but not if it an inanimate object like a rock or a tree. To target a spell at an inanimate object you must select the spell first, then cast it at the object.\n\nLOOT\n\nDue to the nature of the plot, there will be times when you find an overwhelming amount of loot and other times in which it is more scarce. I recommend you hoarde your treasures for later use. Careful adventurers will find items to assist in carrying their treasures.\n\nGRAPHICS SETTINGS:\n\nThere are two very large battles. If your machine bogs down during these battles, return to a prior save game and change your game settings to reduce the load on your processor. I recommend turning off all shadows, reducing textures, and reducing screen resolution. This should only be necessary for these two battles, if at all. \n\n\nMAGIC USE:\n\nI have developed several systems to make magic have a wider use:\n\n-All conversation triggers take into account whether or not you are invisible or hidden. IF you are invisible you can usually choose to pass by, have the conversation, or attack with the advantage of surprise. There are a few plot-vital conversations which you will not be able to dodge this way, but there aren't many. With that said, invisibility is a very powerful spell in this module. \n\n- Look for objects that are useable and on fire. You can cast grease on them for a minor fireball effect.\n\n-Charm person, charm monster, dominate person will be useable in many conversations and will give you different outcomes. Try and have some of these scrolls on hand or spells memorized for use in conversations.\n\n- If you dominate or charm an opponent, you can talk to them and get information from them. I recommend you try this if you like roleplay as it deepens your understanding of the plot. It will also reveal map points and give extra XP.\n\n- There are puzzles and little extra tidbits that can be solved by magic. Be creative with your spell use and you should have some fun.\n\n- Clairvoyance/Clairaudience has widended utility. It can be cast to give you very valuable insight into the area around you and on specific plot related things as well. If you prefer to play a school that is in opposition to divination, you can still acquire an item that allows you to cast the spell.\n\nPLOT AND ROLEPLAY:\n\nI have spent a lot of time going heavier on roleplay and plot for TWA2. There dozens of books, points of intest, and notes which will deepen your understanding of the plot. There are also lots of placeables to look at and read about which will deepen the plot for you.\n\nAREA EXPLORATION:\n\nI have included secrets and other points of interest in many of the areas. Some of them pertain to side-quests and some of them are just for fun. Dilligent explorers will be rewarded with experience points and loot. It is not necessary to explore every bit of every mat to successfully complete the game, however.\n\nCRAFTING:\n\nAs with The Wizard's Apprentice Chapter I, there is minor crafting in Chapter II as long as you kept the components you found in Chapter I. If you are starting a new character, you will be provided with an appropriate set of components.\n\n\nCOMPANIONS:\n\nThere are three main companions that you will travel with throughout your journey and 8 minor companions that will accompany you on only a few quests. Try to keep them alive. They have important things to say. There are plenty of raise dead scrolls, so if a companion goes down, revive him, her, or it (you'll see) before moving on or you will miss content. How you treat your main companions influences their reputation toward you. Earning the loyalty of your companions will provide rewards and additional experience points along the course of your adventures.\n\nTwo companions are fully romanceable with conventional gender restrictions. Romance options in dialogue will be marked with lavender text. There is also a separate friendship reputation system. Romance and friendship will be tracked separately, therefore you can have a more dynamic relationship with your compaions. Romancing options are for roleplay purposes and will have little impact on other areas of gameplay other than dialogue. Reputation, however can bestow benefits. If you reach certain levels of reputation with your companions they may teach you additional skills or bestow useful gifts upon you. \n\nWORLD MAP/AREA TRANSITIONING:\n\nThere isn't one, however after certain quests, you will be given the option to return to certain central areas to speed travel. I do not recommend that you take these options too frequently as you will probably miss content. However, if you are on your second or third play-through, if you are in a hurry, or if you grow impatient with the great distances of the northern wastelands, you may use these options for your comfort and convenience.\n\nDEATH:\n\nIf you die, you say something clever, then fall to the ground. No respawn. If your companions are still alive, they can use a raise dead scroll on you or cast raise dead, if you all die, game over. Save a lot and be very cautious. Always have a final trick up your sleeve for sticky situations.\n\nThere are situations in which characters or companions will be spontaneously resurrected. This is to allow plot-critical conversations or important content to be experienced. \n\n**NOTE: In some rare instances, the death screen may appear even though you still have party members alive. I have tried to correct this, but suspect it may still occur due to some unknown reason. If this happens, press ESC, then save your game under a new name (do not save over an old game, just in case) and then reload to that game. That will get rid of the death screen and allow you to continue adventuring. \n\nSKILLS:\n\nI recommend you max out your wizarding skills for maximum enjoyment. Also add in some conversation skills as much as possible for additional conversation options. Survival, spot, and listen skills are also important. \n\nRESTING:\n\nYour ability to rest in the wilderness without interruption is based on the highest survival skill in your party, so your character does not need to have a high survival skill, but one character in the party should. Resting in other areas is fairly intuitive with appropriate restrictions applied. Careful explorers will find safe havens to rest and refresh their spells in. There are also items that can refresh your spells withou resting, if you find them.\n\nROLEPLAY CHOICES:\n\nFighting is not always the best option. If you fight with everyone you meet, you will miss out on some very interesting and useful items. If you are carful with your decisions, you may find allies in unexpected places as well.\n\nFOG OF WAR:\n\nYou have the option of using the fog of war in TWA2. Fog of war will black out any area of the map that has not yet been explored. TWA2 was made with fog of war in mind and the first part, where you have no map, will only make sense if you have fog of war installed. However, if you don't like it, you don't have to use it. Simply install the no_fow_twa2_hak instead of the standard one and you will have no fog of war.\n\nFEEDBACK:\n\nThe Wizard's Apprentice Chapter II was a monumental effort that took well over one thousand hours of work. If you enjoyed it, please provide positive feedback. It was the positive feedback from The Wizard's Apprentice Chapter I that made it possible for me to finish this sequel. I have the third and final chapter planned and your feedback will help a great deal with my ability to finish it. \n\nYou can discuss the module and ask for help on the Bioware Social Forum Discussion Boards\nCUSTOM CONTENT:\n\nRWS Swimming\nRWS Pocket Ship Interiors\nRWS Grand Citadel\nRWS Pocket Cathedral\nRWS creatures\nZarathustra217 - Walkmesh helpers\nArpharazon - Arpharazon's Custom Creature Conversion Project\nLance Botelle :henchman crash fix, Fog of War,(Althéa Blog:&#56256;&#56320;http://worldofalthea.blogspot.com/&#56256;&#56320; (Althéa Campaign Blog.)&#56256;&#56320;)\nblack skydome\nEguintir Eligard - ice elemental skin and playtesting\nArtemisJ - Toril Globe VFX\nZpirit - zpirit's mushroom pack\nMSpytkowski - EOC new speed trees.\nbotumys - botu_waterfall\nEvil Edison - Evil Edison's Hill Giants and Gray Render\nPain's Monster Pack\nVPJ - tridents pack\nDann J - Dragon breath and scripts\njestemwlodzimierz - mutant model\nHellfire - Skyring Placeables\n\nCUSTOM MUSIC:\n\nAll of the music in The Wizard's Apprentice Chapter II is custom. \n\nMUSIC CREDITS:\nThe Final Battle - Alexandre Guiraud Wizart\nBlade of Blood - Alexandre Guiraud Wizart\nFairy Tale - Alexandre Guiraud Wizart\nIrish Dance - Alexandre Guiraud Wizart\nChevalier - Alexandre Guiraud Wizart\nAn Hero is Born - Alexandre Guiraud Wizart\nTitan - Alexandre Guiraud Wizart\n\nHarp and Cello Fantasy No. 1 - Pal Zoltan Illes\nWinter's Teeth - Pal Zoltan Illes \nBad Foresense - Pal Zoltan Illes\nTainted Vision - Pal Zoltan Illes\nSolitude - Pal Zoltan Illes\n\nGremlins - Pierre Langer\nSouth Sea - Pierre Langer\nPirate's Nest - Pierre Langer, Scott P.

However, there are functions I have put in the game that can get you going again. They are as follows:\n\n**SPOILIER WARNING**\n\nI) There is one bug that a few people get after killing the arctic fell troll. A conversation is not firing and you will find yourself stuck in the cave. If this happens, do thi following:\n\n1)Posess your character\n2)Right-click your character\n3)Open the console with the ` button\n4)Type debugmode 1\n5)Type rs debug_start_convo(2027_killed_arct_fell_troll)\n6)Type debugmode 0 to turn off debug mode\n7) Press the ` key to exit the console.\nThis should start a convo to get you going. If not, then type:\n\nrs debug_start_convo(2027_resting_in_cave)\n\n\nII) Some players have reported that the conversation with the devil doesn't start when you release it. I have been unable to reproduce this bug. Here is a solution:\n\n1)Posess your character\n2)Right-click your character\n3)Open the console with the ` button\n4)Type debugmode 1\n5)Type rs debug_start_convo(2021_veloraxanath)\n6)Type debugmode 0 to turn off debug mode\n7) Press the ` key to exit the console.\n\n\nIII) One player reported that they are in the slaver ship and nothing is happening. If this happens to you:\n\n1)Posess your character\n2)Right-click your character\n3)Open the console with the ` button\n4)Type debugmode 1\n5)Type rs debug_start_convo(2015_slaver_ambush)\n6)Type debugmode 0 to turn off debug mode\n7) Press the ` key to exit the console.\n\n\nPATCH BUG FIXES:\nPatch 1.1 fixes\n-In the conversation with the devil veloraxinath, there was a mis-assigned node which could have caused bugs.\n\nPatch 1.2 fixes\n-Burlak fellaxe used to talk about finishing with barricades while in your party, now he says something more appropriate.\n-If you missed the trigger for the convo before entering dragon's lair, sometimes the convo would fire on the way back out which was odd. Now the trigger is deleted in the convo where you meet the dragon.\n-In eguintir eligard's convo about the familiar, made each node to give him an egg contain the name of what egg you were giving him.\n-You could ask Heldag Lyngstad at the blacksmith about a ship even after you had been to the ship. This has been fixed.\n-Beldarnak could not be leveled up as a barbarian, now he can.\n-Fixed bug where sometimes the devil in the first dungeon would not start a convo with you when released.\n-Attempted to fix bug where the arctic fell troll convo wouldn't fire after you killed it.\n-Fixed a bug that allowed you to notice the ancient door in the cave without activating the dialogue options for the barbarians in the barbarian camp. Now it automatically activates the dialogue options without you having to click on the door.\n\nPatch 1.3 fixes\n-In some cases, if you failed your diplomacy check in the conversation after killing the Arctic Fell Troll, the conversation would break. Fixed this.\n-In some cases if you used charm monster or dominate person scrolls in conversations, the scrolls were not consumed. This has been fixed.\n-If you dominated the Weapon Master in the tower, every time you talked to her, you lost a dominate person scroll. This has been fixed.\n-You could break the plot by using the rod of teleportation to teleport from the lower balcony of the tower of the dark seeker to the courtyard. Now you cannot.\n-Added code to make sure the whole party is resurrected after encounter with slavers in area 205 so that the conversation fires properly.\n-Added autosave after tournament.\n-If you did not pick up the golem parts in the tower of the dark seeker, when the wizard Adolphus Findlepockets gives you the golem, it wan't leveled up. Now it is.\n\nPatch 1.4 fixes\n-You could break the plot by teleporting past a certain boulder in a certain cave. Now you cannot.\n\nPatch 1.41 fixes\n-If your inventory was full in the final battle, some items from the final boss were dropped on the ground and could not be recovered. Now if this happens, they are given to you in the final lobby area for export.\n\nPatch 1.42 fixes\n-If you reached level 13, the staff \"The Winding River\" or the dagger \"The Winding River\" did not operate properly. This has been fixed.\n-The notes on the unfinished golem indicated a recipe for completing the golem. The instructions were misleading and had nothing to do with creating the golem. This was because during development I changed my mind about how you got the golem and forgot to change the notes in the notebook. It has been fixed now. \n\nPatch 1.43 fixes\n-The spellgem is a spell sequencer that you received in the tower for releasing the creatures Nardul and Facade. The spell sequencer never worked very well and would not accept certain spells. This patch removes it because it does not work. \n\nPatch 1.44 fixes\n-In the last patch, I removed the spellgem but some players mentioned that they liked it, so I put it back in.

You are certain though that your road will take you well beyond these farms.\n\nNot much is happening at North Bank Landing. They were barely getting back on their feet after the Charwood Conflict, and now the trolls and hill giants are destroying their farms. However, North Bank does have a very large marketplace that you might be able to spend a whole day in. If you shop �til you drop there, you might not have to drop on the battlefield.

The need to pay back the people who destroyed yours, and your fathers, life is the only thing that has kept you sane these past four years. Now, with Samuel dead, you can see an ending to this, one way or another. \n\nReece is now your target, the man who stole your fathers property and position, the man who now has the ear of Hal Tysan, newly appointed to the Tysan estate since the death of his father just a few short days ago.\n\nFor weeks now you have been living in the wilds, camped in the Neverwinter Wood with only the woodland creatures for company. Watching for a chance to get to Reece, to find a way to discredit him ... to destroy him; but the chance has not come.\n\nNow it seems you position is compromised. Reece knows you are out there and your target is him; he is as keen to see you buried beneath the soil of the sword coast as you are him.\n\nHe has resources: men, money, the ear of powerful allies; you have your sword, your wits and the continual pain from the wounds you suffered at Samuels hands to remind you of who you are and what you have set out to do.\n\nThe odds are against you but perhaps the answer lies in your new found friends. The adventurer who you helped to track down the bandit, Taneth; or his friend, the rogue Ember. Perhaps you can seek comfort and aid from your past, from the fact that the Tysan household are the closest you have to family beyond your own father.\n\nPerhaps these things will be enough ... perhaps at last, with the help of your friends, you can find peace. \n\nThis module is the fifth in a series of five available on the Vault. The others are:\n\nSheep and Stone.\nThe Caravan Club.\nThe last days of the Raven.\nThese Dark Days of Waiting.\n\nThe series will be six modules in length, the last of which is work in progress. All will appear under the campaign title of Tales from the Lake of Sorrows, late in 2012.\n\n\n==================\nThings you should know.\n==================\n\nLocation: Forgotten realms in the area of Neverwinter.\nSetting: The module is set at the same time as SoZ against a backdrop of hard times in Neverwinter brought on by the war with the King of Shadows.\nPlay time 5+ hours\nLevel 9 - 11\nClass Solace (Ranger)\nCompanions 2 - Sometimes\n\nThis is module five in the series Tales from the lake of Sorrows. The story begins just a few hours after the ending in The Last Days of the Raven and carries on with the story threads from that module. It takes place at the same time as These Dark Days of Waiting, while your PC is away from Thunder Bay. The Module tells the story of what happens in the town and develops the story thread that will form the basis of the last part of the series, The Vault of the Damned.\n\nThis story may be played using any character of ninth level but it is written for Solace, the ranger your PC met in the Caravan Club. The story will make sense who ever you choose to use but I have included a Solace.bic file to give you the character the story was written for and you can use this by copying it to your c/mydocs/neverwinternights2/localvault folder.\n\nSome classes may find this easier, some harder but it is balanced for a 9th level ranger and the tactics you might employ as a ranger (partcularly one dedicated to an archery style) will be useful here.\n\nI do not provide a level up area so which ever character you use must be equiped and ready to play. \n\n******** There is combat right from the outset in this module. *********\n\nYou do not need to play this module to progress the plot in the Tales campaign but much of what goes on here builds on the themes I will use in the last part.\n\nNote on combat ¡V Unless you are an experienced tactical player keep all the companions offered to you with you when you can. Consider the character class you have and remember your animal companion. The combat is balanced to be challenging at times but with preparation and tactics none of the encounters will be too difficult to manage. \n\nNote on npc's ¡V If you pass time in the keep or Thunder Bay and the npc's do not appear then walk into a building and out and all should be well.\n\nNote on loading ¡V Load times on these modules are long, particulalry the first one whihc will hang on area 20 for a minute or so. Keep with it, it has not failed to load on me yet �º\n\n================\nLoading instructions.\n================\n\nLoading instructions are included in the zipped file. It is important to follow these carefully as several folders have similar names.\n\nThe module will run from your campaigns start up screen.\n\n===================\nThings you should know:\n===================\n\nTransitions are sometimes made without a world map. In some outdoor areas you will find either a stone, a sign or an area transition that will get you out. For indoor areas use the door like everybody else.\n\nYour npc's are Ember(fighter/rogue) and Silas(rogue). Npc¡¦s are not always available and in the first part of the mod you are one your own. Even there one of the story thread will allow you to pick up companions for a short while.\n\nThe npc's have back stories which you can access as the module progresses. Ember in particular will develop her romance with your main PC if you choose to keep her with you.\n\nOn two occasions you will tell some of your own story through PC conversation nodes. These are short and allow you to develop Solace in way that suits you.\n\n====\nTime\n====\n\nThis mod is very time based. Shops shut at night and certain npc's are not available at certain times. Resting is restricted in places but generally you can rest where you need to. All of the innkeepers and the sundial in the market square, will allow you to pass up to 4 hours without resting so you should never be stuck waiting. Note however, at night most, if not all, npc's go to one of the inns. If they are not there then they are not plot movers.\n\nWhile in Thunder Bay you will hear a bell from time to time. This rings on the sixes, giving you a general idea of the time of day.\n\n==============\nWhat the mod has:\n==============\n\nThis is a linear story driven module. There are side quests but limited possibilities for sandbox style play. That said there are places to explore with rewards for doing so and in the early part there are several ways to complete the main quest. If this gets a bit mixed up I apologise for that. Talking to every one may reveal opportunities to gain exp. \n\nThe module has a good degree of npc interaction talk to them and they will talk right back :)\n\n======================\nWhat this mod does not have:\n======================\n\nSoZ style conversations.\nFlexible npc hiring and firing.\n\n===========\nBig thanks bit:\n===========\n\nThanks go to the following for their parts in the making and testing of the mod.\n\nM.Reider for all his continued support in the development, testing and scripting for this series of modules.\nArkalzelth for his play testing and advice on character builds.\nOfficerdon for playtesting and advice on lore. \nSeagloom for advice in this and previous mods on lore relating to the cults of the sword coast.\nUncle FB for the Uncle FB's NPC control.\nLilac soul for the script generator ¡V all scripts, not written by Matt, were written using this.\nPains for his moster and apperance compilations.\nSean Caldecott for his Island tower with cave prefab which is the only prfab area I have used in this mod.\nNicethugbert for his excellent eroded hills and valleys area sets. Many of my areas have these at thier core.\n\nAll of the modders who have placed most excellent custom content on the vault in particular RWS for the creatire and tile set mods.\n\nFinally my thanks to the forum users who helped with my questions.\n\n=====\nMusic\n=====\n\nThere is a lot of custom music in this module. Credit is due to the following persons.\n\nFor the playing of La Manfredina which may be heard in Thunder Bay, Grien Sluis which is played in the afternoon in the market Tavern and the Trotto which in played in the Market Tavern late at night thanks to Susan Sandman and Derwent crocker. If these sound good to you then you can find these and other tracks on The Medieval Lady, available on Leonarda productions. I payed royalties for these tracks please do not rip them.\n\nFor the playing of the many guitar tracks used in the taverns and inns of my modules thanks to Jon Sayles. Check out his website for an enormous free resource and also develop a love for his art.\n\nMuch of the area music may be found on freesound, the composer of all the track I use is Tillman Sillescu, big thanks to him for his art and for making the music freely available.\n\nSome area music is the work of the Celestial aeon project again I give my thanks for thier providing thier music for free use.\n\nSorry I have not been more specific about tracks used. If you want to know more PM me one the forums and I will hook you up with any tracks that interest you.\n\nI hope you enjoy From This Comes Strength and hope also than you can find time to vote and comment.\n\nThanks and enjoy,\n\nPJ\n \n\n\n","Rating":9.67,"Votes":30,"Awards":[]},"515":{"Name":"Fanglewood","Author":"Alupinu","Submitted":20120823,"Updated":20121222,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dungeon Adventure, Forest Adventure, Various Settings","Forum Thread":"Link","Scope":"Large","Content":"Teen","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Light","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"03","Gameplay Length":"20","Categories":"Campaign","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Eyeing you questionably, the guild officer starts to explain. �It should only take a couple of days.

You can filter out the spells with a script on login and on level up if you really really want, but I personally don't think it's worth the time it takes to code it.\n2. You'll have to manually pick either smite evil or smite good at character creation (you'll have to click, but you'll be limited to the appropriate choice). Live with it.\n3. Deity selection goes wonky if you are a paladin of an alignment that is not LG. As far as I can tell (aka, after looking for 5 minutes into the problem), it's some weird stuff going on at the engine level. As a result, not all selectable deities will be appropriate for a paladin of the selected alignment.\n\nHave fun, good luck.","Rating":7,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"519":{"Name":"Nesmè","Author":"Torm","Submitted":20121127,"Updated":20121128,"Category":"Multiplayer (10+ Players)","Module Types":"City Adventure, Roleplay","Scope":"Dependant on Module","Content":"NA","Tricks & Traps":"NA","Roleplay":"Dependant on Module","Hack & Slash":"NA","Min Character Level":"Any","Max Character Level":"Any","Gameplay Length":"1","Categories":"Faerun\nTrollmoors\nSilver Marches\nNesme","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"The City of Nesme for NWN2\n\nI made this very meticulously and spent over 500 hours on the city alone.\n\nI am really hoping that someone will use this, add shops, and get a good persistent RP server going again similar to the old Nesme.\n\nBuild around the city and the trollmoors etc...","Rating":9,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"520":{"Name":"Sarmates!","Author":"Claudius33","Submitted":20121201,"Updated":20130323,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Epic, Roleplay, Various Settings","Scope":"Large","Content":"Adult","Tricks & Traps":"Dependant on Module","Roleplay":"Heavy","Hack & Slash":"Dependant on Module","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"03","Gameplay Length":"30","Categories":"Single player story driven campaign.\nBilingual Français / English.\nPeplum and legends.","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Sarmates!

Thus I will not\ncontinue this campaign, but within the next weeks, I will provide some scripts\nsuch that the unique items of the mod can also be used in other mods.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRequired hakpacks:\n\nItem Placeables by Tero Kivinen: Link\nUnzip itemplaceables105.7z and copy itemplaceables.hak to your hak directory.\n\nLB Map functions by Lance Botelle: Link\nUnzip LB_FogOfWar_ActivePassive_110211_v102.rar and copy lbfogofwar.hak to\nyour hak directory.\n\nRWS snowtrees by Robinson Workshop: Link\nUnzip Snow.rar and copy snowtrees.hak to your hak directory. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstallation and Starting the mod:\n\nUnzip the Archiv to My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2. To start the game, \nchoose \"New Campaign\", not \"New Module\".\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGameplay changes:\n\n- XP: You do not get XP for slain enemies (with a few exceptions), but for\nquest progress. The reason for this is that the three different main plots\ninvolve different battles. Moreover, I do not want to disadvantage players who\nprefer to sneak by there enemies, or lure them towards other NPCs, which will\ndo the dirty work for the player.\n\n- Death: There is nothing more final than death. So save often and in\ndifferent slots, because there will be no swift resurrection in the next\ntemple for you.\n\n- Etiquette: Most people are not happy if you face them with a weapon in your\nhand. Before talking to someone, it is better to sheath your weapon, unless\nyou want to rob him. Furthermore, you can get into a lot of trouble if you get\ncaught while picking locks or if you loot everything that you find in someone\nelses house.\n\n- Rest: You can say how long you want to rest. Regenerating feats and spells\nrequires a resting time of at least 8 hours. Health is regenerated\nproportional to the resting time, each hour you regenerate one eighth of your\nmaximal hitpoints.\nIf you ever tried to buy a new sword at 4 am, you will know that also shorter\nresting durations make sense.\n\n- Opponents: Also opponents are healed while you are resting. It does not work\nto bring you enemy down to half of his hitpoints, run away, rest to replenish\nyour spells, and then return to finish him off. Furthermore, your opponents do\nalso heal when you load from a savegame, therefore you should not save during\na battle. Only the dead remain dead - at least most of them...\n\n- Alchemy: I reworked the alchemy system. There is a difference between\nalchemistic and magic potions. To brew an alchemistic potion, put the\ningredients on an alchemist's workbench, and apply your mortar and pestle on\nit. Your Brew-Alchemy skill must be high enough. To create a magical potion,\nplace the ingredients on a magician's workbench, and cast the correct spell on\nit. You do not need the Brew-Alchemy skill for this. Search for recipes in the\ngame, or do your own experiments. But be careful, many unskilled alchemists\nalready lost their lives.\n\n- Forging: Also the forging system was reworked. Nonmagical items are still\ncreated from a mold and the corresponding base ingredients. Put all\ningredients on a blacksmith's workbench, and apply your smith hammer on it. To\nforge a magical item, additionally a magical base item and an essence are\nrequired. Not every base item can be combined with every essence, and some\nbase items can only be used for certain types of weapons or armors. Normally,\nthe magical properties of the base item are just transferred to the armor or\nweapon, but special combinations result in unique weapons. Search for recipes\nin the game, or talk to someone who is skilled in this matter.\n\n- Invisibility: For reasons of game balancing, invisibility is not only ended\nby hostile actions, but also by starting a conversation.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUsed tools and utilities:\n- Grinning Fool's Creature Creator\n- Sunjammers Visual Effect Browser\n- TerraCoppa by Tani\n- Tree Randomization Plugin by Aokis\n- trnpack/trnunpack by Tero Kivinen\n- RWS snow textures by Robinson Workshop\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to:\n- Tero Kivinen, Lance Botelle, Robinson Workshop, Grinning Fool, Sunjammer, \nTani, Aokism for their hakpacks and tools.\n- SGK73 for the invention of deep snow areas.\n- The whole NWN2 community, which always helped me to find a solution, even on\nmy most complicated questions in the forum.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBugs:\nI spent many hours with beta testing and bugfixing, but no software is \nbug-free. There should be nothing gamebraking in it, but there can be some \nminor bugs, and as I am not a native speaker, the english version could \ncontain linguistic bugs.

Deshalb werde ich die Kampagne nicht fortführen, aber in den\nnächsten Wochen noch ein paar Skripte bereitstellen, so dass die neuen\nGegenstände auch in anderen Mods verwendet werden können.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenötigte Hakpacks:\n\nItem Placeables von Tero Kivinen: Link\nEntpacke itemplaceables105.7z und kopiere itemplaceables.hak ins\nhak-Verzeichnis.\n\nLB Map functions von Lance Botelle: Link\nEntpacke LB_FogOfWar_ActivePassive_110211_v102.rar und lege lbfogofwar.hak ins\nhak-Verzeichnis.\n\nRWS snowtrees von Robinson Workshop: Link\nEntpacke Snow.rar und lege snowtrees.hak ins hak-Verueichnis.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstallation und Spielstart:\n\nEntpacke das Archiv in My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2. Zum Starten des \nSpiels \"Neue Kampagne\" auswählen, nicht \"Neues Modul\".\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nÄnderungen am Gameplay:\n\n- Erfahrungspunkte: Es gibt keine Erfahrungspunkte für getötete Gegner (mit \neinigen wenigen Ausnahmen), sondern nur für das Fortschreiten in Questen. \nGrund hierfür ist, dass die drei verschiedenen Haupt-Questlinien \nsehr unterschiedliche Kämpfe enthalten. Ausserdem sollen Spieler nicht \nbenachteiligt werden, wenn sie sich lieber an Gegnern vorbeischleichen oder \ndiese in die Nähe anderer NSCs locken, welche dann die Drecksarbeit für den \nSpieler übernehmen.\n\n- Der Tod: Es gibt wohl nichts endgültigeres als den Tod. Also speicher oft\nund in verschiedenen Slots, eine eilige Wiedergeburt im nächsten Tempel wird\nes für dich nicht geben.\n\n- Allgemeine Benimmregeln: Die meisten Menschen sind nicht sehr erfreut \ndarüber, wenn man ihnen mit gezückter Waffe gegenübertritt. Vor einem Gespräch \nsollte man die Waffe also besser wegstecken, es sei denn, man will seinen \nGegenüber ausrauben. Ausserdem kann man sich eine Menge Ärger einhandeln, wenn \nman sich beim Schlösser knacken erwischen lässt oder in fremden Häusern alles \nmitnimmt, was nicht festgenagelt ist.\n\n- Rasten: Beim Rasten kann man nun die Dauer in Stunden angeben. Fähigkeiten \nund Zaubersprüche werden nur bei einer Rastdauer von mindestens 8 Stunden \nregeneriert. Gesundheit wird anteilig der Rastdauer regeneriert, für jede \nStunde Rast wird ein Achtel der maximalen Gesundheit des Spielers regeneriert.\nWer schon einmal um 4 Uhr morgens versucht hat, ein neues Schwert zu kaufen, \nweiss, dass auch Rastzeiten von nur wenigen Stunden sinnvoll sind.\n\n- Gegner: Auch Gegner heilen sich, während man rastet. Es bringt also nichts, \neinen Gegner halbtot zu schlagen, wegzurennen, nochmals zu rasten um ein paar \nmehr Zaubersprüche zu bekommen, und dann versuchen dem Gegner den Rest zu \ngeben. Gegner heilen übrigens auch beim Neuladen eines Spielstandes, deshalb \nsollte man besser nicht während einer Schlacht abspeichern. Nur Tote sind für\nimmer tot; naja, wenigstens die meisten...\n\n- Tränke brauen: Das Alchemiesystem wurde überarbeitet. Es wird unterschieden \nzwischen alchemistischen und magischen Tränken. Um einen alchemistischen Trank \nzu brauen, müssen alle Zutaten auf einer Alchemisten-Werkbank gelegt werden \nund Mörser und Stössel darauf aktiviert werden. Ausserdem muss die Trank-\nBrauen-Fähigkeit hoch genug sein. Um einen magischen Trank zu brauen, müssen \ndie Zutaten auf eine Magier-Werkbank gelegt werden und der korrekte \nZauberspruch auf die Werkbank gewirkt werden. Hierfür ist keine Trank-Brauen-\nFähigkeit vonnöten. Suche im Spiel nach Rezepten, oder experimentiere selber. \nAber vorsicht, es ist schon manch ungeschickter Alchemist ums Leben gekommen.\n\n- Schmieden: Das Schmiedesystem wurde ebenfalls überarbeitet. Nichtmagische \nGegenstände werden nach wie vor aus einer Form und den benötigten Metallen \ngefertigt. Lege alle Zutaten auf eine Schmiede-Werkbank und aktiviere einen \nSchmiedehammer darauf. Um magische Gegenstände zu erhalten, muss zusätzlich \nein magischer Gegenstand und eine Essenz verwendet werden. Nicht jeder \nGegenstand ist mit jeder Essenz kombinierbar, und er kann auch nicht für jeden \nWaffen- oder Rüstungstyp verwendet werden. Im Normalfall werden nur gewisse \nmagische Eigenschaften auf Waffe oder Rüstung übertragen, aber bestimmte \nKombinationen ergeben einzigartige Gegenstände. Suche im Spiel nach Rezepten, \noder frage jemanden, der sich damit auskennt.\n\n- Unsichtbarkeit: Aus Gründen des Spielbalance wird Unsichtbarkeit nicht nur \ndurch Kampfhandlungen beendet, sondern auch durch das Beginnen einer \nKonversation.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVerwendete Tools und Utilities:\n- Grinning Fool's Creature Creator\n- Sunjammers Visual Effect Browser\n- TerraCoppa von Tani\n- Tree Randomization Plugin von Aokis\n- trnpack/trnunpack von Tero Kivinen\n- RWS snow textures von Robinson Workshop\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDanksagung:\n- Tero Kivinen, Lance Botelle, Robinson Workshop, Grinning Fool, Sunjammer, \nTani, Aokism für ihre Hakpacks und Tools.\n- SGK73 für die geniale Idee der Deepsnow-Areas.\n- Die gesamte NWN2-Community, welche auch bei komplizierteren Fragen im \nForum immer geholfen hat, eine Lösung zu finden.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBugs:\nIch habe sehr viel Zeit mit Betatesting und Bugfixing verbracht, aber keine\nSoftware ist bugfrei. Es sollten zumindest keine Bugs mehr dabei sein, welche\ndas Spiel unspielbar machen, aber kleinere Bugs sind immer möglich.

Now something is once again attacking ships sailing through the islands. \nThe Baron Hochoch - patron of your previous adventures in the area - calls upon your skills once more to investigate the cause - and put an end to it!\n\nLike previous adventures in the series, this is designed for Single or Multi-players, so there are Henchlings available in the starting town if any are needed to add skills to the party. Depending on your level, experience & play style, you may need more or less of them to help you on your way.\n\nDeath - Because of the way this adventure is structured, unlike previous adventures, death is now final - please remember to save often -(remember quick-save is F12 by default).\nYour companions don't suffer that fate if they're overcome in combat - depending on how much damage they took, they'll merely be out cold for a few rounds, then get up & wander round a bit, or they'll be gone for good (although Resurrection or Raise Dead should work fine).\n\nEncounters - Think tactically. Some opponents may be too tough for your party - before you start any fights, make sure you can finish them, and maybe take a look at your environment to find the most advantageous positions to fight. \n\nIts not an MMO - Unlike MMO games, you may benefit from learning to scout, and pausing the game at the start of each encounter so you can best organise your characters. Running in & hoping for the best isn't what will keep you alive.\n And maybe save often.\n\nXP - you DON'T get much experience for killing things. What you DO get it for is exploring and completing both the main quest and the side quests that you may come across as you explore. \nBy the end of this chapter of the Crystalmist Campaign, your character/s should be level 6.\n\nCustom Content - Like the other adventures in this campaign, Sahuagin Heel uses the Crystalmist HAK, plus a smaller HAK file with content just used by this adventure, namely:\nTridents\nLink\n\nFinally, I know NWN2 is getting a little long in the tooth now, although I'm not aware of any other game allowing you to build D&D adventures in such detail (I'm reserving judgement on Neverwinter until I've seen the Foundry, but so far it doesn't look like much of a competitor due to the limitations of the game mechanics). \nTherefore, I'm still building for NWN2 & any feedback is gratefully received, so please let me know anything you liked, didn't like, or just anything at all.

Use skills and rogue abilities as a Shadow Thief in the streets of the Amnian city of Crimmor. \n\nYou may like this module, you may not. Crimmor is experimental and is focused primarily on the urban environment and providing the \"feel\" of a city, as well as rogue focused non-combat gameplay. If you are all about combat, this is probably not the module for you. \n\nCrimmor pushes the NWN2 toolset's hard limit on objects in the external city areas, additionally, there are numerous npcs in the city. I recommend a modern pc. You've been warned.\n\nCrimmor takes many things, from food, street, shop, and npc names, to the unusual relationship of the Shadow Thieves to the city, from Ed Greenwood's article on the city in Dragon Magazine issue 334. Thank you Ed. Some things I had to change in the interest of gameplay.\n\nCharacters without rogue levels are unsupported, though bards will probably work fine as well. You are not required to have levels in the Shadow Thief of Amn prestige class. You are not required to be evil.\n\nMagic levels are low, there are few +2 items. Don't worry about that, Crimmor isn't a module about \"powering up\". You can reach up to level 14 in Crimmor. There are four possible endings, not all of which are good for the pc, and it is possible to end the game via decisions you make before the \"end\".\n\nAmong other things, Crimmor uses a custom lockpicking system (courtesy of RWS), all custom sound in the environment (courtesy freesound.org). It has custom weapon and item classes, and pseudo prestige classes (Crimmor does not change any 2das except for the loadscreens and trees.2das, so it works with any custom content that does not alter these, including class packs). Finally, the thieves speak cant. A pdf guide has been provided that goes over gameplay things, and includes a dictionary of the cant used as well as some background on Crimmor.\n\nThe module is completable without killing anything. There's no secret achievement or bonus for doing so. No xp is awarded for combat, only quest completion and exploration. There are approximately 10 hours of content.\n\nThere's a lot going on behind the scenes with things, and some things are pretty complicated. As with any 1.0 release, there are bound to be some bugs that managed to slip by, but there are two I am aware of:\nLockpicking does not consume lockpicks (yay for you, freebie!). Lights do not affect the hide skill though the DM will tell you it does, as there were seemingly unsolvable problems with this (I hope to get this fixed via patch). These have minimal game effect and were significantly delaying release, so I chose to go ahead and release.\n\nThanks to my testers: Arkalezth, PJ156, GFallen01.","Rating":9.75,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"528":{"Name":"Nightmare: a test module","Author":"coercer_angra","Submitted":20130409,"Updated":20130414,"Category":"Single Player","Module Types":"Dramatic, Dungeon Adventure, Horror/Survival Horror, Puzzles, Twisted / Dark","Scope":"Medium","Content":"Mature","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Roleplay":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Min Character Level":"01","Max Character Level":"05","Gameplay Length":"03","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This is a sample from \"Psycho Soma, Chapter 1\" that I have developed; however, I thought I would release this short section of the game for players to try.

Download helltest.zip, which is contained below, and extract it into your hak folder also. (It makes use of displacer beasts, camb's splatter pack, and scorpions, among a few other things). \n3.

Download \"Hell_mod.zip\", which is the module. Extract it (but not the folder itself) to your mydocuments\\neverwinter nights 2\\modules.\n5. If you have outside materials in your override folder, you may need to relocate that material elsewhere temporarily while playing this module.\n6. Load the game (new game, modules); it will be listed as HELL_TEST.\n///////////////////////////\nThis sample picks up 'in media res' - in the full campaign, you will already have done a few things before coming here, and some of the story will have been set forth already. For the purposes of the story, the game interprets your character as a female, no matter what your gender (sorry, guys out there!).\n\nHelpful Hints:\n(1) It is normal for you to take continuous damage while in this dungeon. Obviously some means of surviving this process are contained inside the dungeon. It is also normal that you will be punished violently for using spells such as light and invisibility. There is no way to avoid this.\n(2) This section of the dungeon mostly requires FIRST PERSON perspective - otherwise, you will see only 'black'. This is on purpose. \n(3) There are two main halves of the dungeon, which largely mirror each other. Very often, making a change on one side of the dungeon alters something on the mirrored half!\n(4) I have made use of occasional illusionary walls - be on the lookout!\n(5) As you receive items, inspect them. Often they will allow passage through previously blockaded areas, and also, tend to have powers that you can use to make your journey easier.\n(6) The Z Key is your friend in dark places - holding it down will highlight any usable objects, like containers or doors.\n(7) The dungeon is designed to be rather difficult, and while there is no technical resting allowed, there are a few spots that you can rest; they require certain items called 'curriculum vitae' which can be used to activate designated areas.\n(8) No FaQ exists at this time, although if there is a need for one, or enough interest, I might prepare one.

Men and women of all classes and backgrounds are invited to present themselves at the town of Littlelake, where they will be taken on on a first come first hired basis.\n\nThat was what the bard had said when he came into the inn on that wet afternoon late in the summer of 1374. That was the day your adventure started and the day your life changed forever.\n\nLocationForgotten realms � in the area of Neverwinter.\nSettingThe module is set at the same time as SoZ against a backdrop of hard times in Neverwinter brought on by the war with the King of Shadows.\nPlay time 25 - 30 hours (plus 6 � 8 hours (see notes)) \nLevel 1 - 13\nClass Any\nCompanions 5 but not all at once\n\nTales from The Lake of Sorrows is an adventure for any class which will take your character from level 1 to level 12 � 13 over 25 � 30 hours of gameplay. The story is set on the Lake of Sorrows, a large glacial lake which I have located to the Southwest of Neverwinter. It takes place at the same time as Storm of Zehir and several locations and people will be recognised from that campaign and the OC.\nIf the player wishes you may also play a sixth part of the series, from this comes strength. This tells part of the story from a different viewpoint, that of Solace the npc. This should be played after chapter 4 and before chapter 6 and adds an additional 6 � 8 hours of gameplay. This additional module must be downloaded from the vault spearately.\n\nThis is a linear story led mod, there are some side quests and conversations which boost your exp but this is not a sandbox mod by any means.\n\nNote on combat � Unless you are an experienced tactical player keep all the companions with you, the combat is balanced to be challenging at times on normal game setting but with preparation and tactics none of the encounters will be too difficult to manage.\n\n===============\nLoading instructions.\n===============\n\nWith the exception of the video file the folders are zipped and named as thier destination folders.\n\nThe modules files 1 and 2 should be unzipped to:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\modules\n\nThe campaign folder file should be unzipped to:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns\n\nThe Hak file should be unzipped to:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Hak\n\nThe music file should be unzipped to:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\music\n\nAnd the file named tlos_open.blk should be placed as it is (it is not compressed) into\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\movies\n\nHaving done this you can launch thegame and you will find the Tales from the Lake of Sorrows camapign in your list of campaigns.\n\nNotes: \n=====\n\n1. You do not need to overwrite any haks you have but it does not matter if you do. \n2. Some of the music files will overwrite if you have any of my stand alone modules on your hard drive. It is okay to allow them to overwrite.\n3. It is useful to read the campaign notes before you start; in particular, note that Ember is faithless. Keep her that way and the story will make more senseTales from the Lake of Sorrows\n\n===================\nThings you should know:\n===================\n\nThere are no race restrictions, but humans are the order of the day.\n\nCombat difficulty varies and is tough in places but if you have the NPC's provided with you then you should always prevail, particularly if you use the terrain to your advantage. I have balanced the game for normal rules setting switching to hardcore will make the game much tougher as will leaving behind any of the npc�s I have given you.\n\nYour facilitator for the first four modules is Ormin, if you find yourself not sure what to do and the journal does not help then you probably need to be talking to Ormin. In Modules five and six the facilitator is Matthias. Other npc's are carried along with the story and it is worth visiting principle protagonists as the story develops.\n\nTransitions are made without a world map. In each outdoor area you will find either a stone, a sign or an area transition that will get you out. For indoor areas use the door like everybody else.\n\n=====\nNPC�s\n=====\n\nYour npc's are: \n\nEmber(see below), Honour(Mage), Solace(ranger), Alan(fighter) and Harald(fighter).\n\nIn each module not all of these will be available to you except Ember. She starts out as a rogue but her stats are such that she can be used as a mage, fighter or other class. For story reasons do not make Ember a cleric and do not give her a god. She is faithless for a reason and you should keep her so to fully enjoy the latter part of the series.\n\nAlways talk to the the npc�s often. Each has at least 8000 words of dialogue, not all of which will be available on any given run through. They will give you hints if you need them and will develop the plot as well. None of these conversation are required to progress however and if you wish to ignore them you may.\n\nYou will know how well you are treating the npc's by the way they talk to you. The less well you treat then the less you will get out of them.\n\nThe npc's have back stories which you can access as the module progresses if you have a good enough relationship with them.\n\n=======\nRomance\n=======\n\nEmber is the only Romance available. It does not kick off properly till the end of Chapter 2 though to get that you need to be in her good books. Thus you need to start wooing her from the very start. There are three other conversations that will launch the romance later in other mods. Once started it cannot be stopped except by talking to one of the working girls in the last major town. She takes a very dim veiw of that. Any race or sex may romance Ember.\n\n====\nTime\n====\n\nThis mod is very time based. Shops shut at night and certain npc's are not available at certain times. Resting is restricted in places but generally you can rest where you need to. All of the innkeepers and the sundial in the market square, will allow you to pass up to 4 hours without resting so you should never be stuck waiting. Note however, at night most, if not all, npc's go to one of the inns. If they are not there then they are not plot movers.\n\nWhile in the main town of thunder bay you will hear a bell from time to time. This rings on the sixes, giving you a general idea of the time of day.\n\n===============\nWhat the mod has:\n===============\n\nThis is a linear story driven module. There are side quests but limited possibilities for sandbox style play. That said there are places to explore with rewards for doing so. Talking to every one will reveal opportunities to gain exp and the barkstrings of no core npc's will change as the story develops.\n\nThe module has a good degree of npc interaction and the npc's have back stories which will be revealed as the mod plays out.\n\n========================\nWhat this mod does not have:\n========================\n\nSoZ style conversations.\nFlexible npc hiring and firing.\n\n===========\nBig thanks bit:\n===========\n\nThanks go to the following for their parts in the making and testing of the mod.\n\nM.Reider - for all his support in the development, testing and scripting for this module. Without M.R. it would not be the same module.\nR. Lebeau - for his help in getting some o the coversations right. R.L. has put many hours of effort into testing and conversation checking, all of which have been much appreciated.\nArkalezth - for his playtesting and help with character builds.\nLance Botelle � for his support and gold tinting for various statues.\nOfficerDon - for playtesting and help with the lore of the sword coast.\nToupon � for the amazeing city Hak\nBTH � for his houses and towers sets.\nRealms of Trinity team � for the placebales set.\nQuixal - for his support in play testing.\nAlupinu - for his play testing support and walk mesh hints.\nAllThatJazz - for her dialogue support.\nUncle FB - for the Uncle FB's NPC control.\nLilac soul for the script generator � all scripts, not written by Matt, were written using this.\nRWS for the stirges model and the dungeon, sewer and circular building tilesets.\n\nFinally thanks to the forum users especially Chaos Weilder who helped me with all the techie bits which I can't do, which frankly is all the techie bits.\n\n=====\nMusic\n=====\n\nThere is a lot of custom music in this module much of it drawn from my developing interest in medieval music, particularly where played on original instruments. Credit is due to the following persons.\n\nFor the playing of La Manfredina which may be heard in Thunder Bay, Grien Sluis which is played in the afternoon in the market Tavern and the Trotto which in played in the Market Tavern late at night thanks to Susan Sandman and Derwent crocker. This music in played on authentic instruments and, to me, sounds great. If it sounds good to you then you can find these and other tracks on The Medieval Lady, available on Leonarda productions. I payed royalties for these tracks please do not rip them.\n\nFor the playing of The nite watch (Anthony Holborne 1545 � 1629) as played at certain times in the Red Griffin and In this trembling shadow (John Dowland 1563 � 1626) as played in the afternoon in the Market Tavern thanks to Jon Sayles. Check out his website for an enormous free resource and also develop a love for his art.\n\nFor other tracks which I shall not list except by exception below, all were written and produced by Tillman Silescu and may be found on the Freesound website.\n\nPortent (used in littlelake) - Todd Galtreau\nEvil King � Peter Calandra.\nKyrie � James Wilson.\nBroken hearted and Black arts � Mike Newport.\n\nIf you consider that all other custom Tracks were written by Tillman Sillescu it goes without saying that I am exceptionally grateful to him for sharing his art.
