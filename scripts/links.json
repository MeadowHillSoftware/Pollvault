A means of creating adventures and even entire campaigns in a fraction of the time it normally takes to build them would be an ideal tool to complement NWN (Neverwinter Nights) experience. Although the Aurora Toolset is an excellent tool for module makers and allows for nearly limitless possibilities, the amount of time required to both learn and use the toolset often proves to be prohibitively taxing in both time and effort for most DMs (Dungeon Masters).\n\nThis project is intended to answer these needs and has done so in a way that does not severely compromise creativity and flexibility.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"265":{"Title":"The Kingdom Of Stratholme - Part of the Valadfar Series","Author":"Rigamortis","Submitted":20070212,"Updated":20070212,"Category":"Miscellaneous","WebLink":"Link","Update Frequency":"Daily","Description":"The World of Valadfar, Books and Modules.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"269":{"Title":"Alazander's Blog Announced","Author":"Alazander","Submitted":20070320,"Updated":20120620,"Category":"News and Info","WebLink":"Link","Update Frequency":"Daily","Description":"Hall of Fame author Alazander is pleased to announce the opening of his new blog.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"270":{"Title":"The Triad Project Forum","Author":"Ramas Obarskyr","Submitted":20070406,"Updated":20070406,"Category":"Total Conversations","Update Frequency":"Daily","Description":"This is the official link to the TRIAD Project Forum.

It is based on the Neverwinter Nights 2 computer roleplaying game developed by Obsidian Entertainment.\n\nThe Neverwinter Nights 2 module of the World of Charun is now in its Fourth Age, after the fall of the Third Age, which happened in the first installment of Neverwinter Nights.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD OF CHARUN\n\nThe World of Charun is first and foremost a roleplay adventure server. If using labels most players of NWN are familiar with, we'd go with a Roleplay server as well as a Hardcore server. Part of the goal with WoC is to create a perfect combination between Pen and Paper roleplay, and what is offered through NWN.\n\nThe world is to inspire and excite!\n\nThe player characters are adventurers by trade, not cobblers or farmers, at least when they head on out and become rogues, wizards and fighters. We believe that the best experiences, the best roleplay and the greatest excitement is found during events that would make good stories, movies or books. Frodo had to leave home, or there wouldn't have been a book. Player characters are encouraged to explore, loot and seek thrills. That is how legends are made. The important thing to keep in mind is that nothing is worth anything without roleplaying during your adventures.\n\nCome join us and see for yourself!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Full Persistency (coming soon)\n- A Completely Unique & Realistic Combat System\n- A Dynamic Housing & Castle System (coming soon)\n- A Dynamic Followers, Henchmen & Hirelings System (coming soon)\n- A Dynamic and Global Reputation & Fame System (coming soon)\n- Extensive & Improved PnP Spells & Ruleset\n- Highly Improved Artificial Creature Intelligence\n- Entirely Custom Weapons, Armors & Items\n- Gorgeous & High-quality Environments\n- 60+ Areas and growing\n- A Dedicated & Friendly Community\n- A Comitted & User-Friendly Staff\n- Regular DM Events\n- And so much more...\n\nYours sincerely,\nThe World of Charun Staff","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"277":{"Title":"NWvisuals - Fantasy Books Visuals","Author":"NWvisuals","Submitted":20080203,"Updated":20080205,"Category":"Miscellaneous","WebLink":"Link","Update Frequency":"Daily","Forums":"Link","Description":"Creating fantasy Books Visuals using Neverwinter Nights!

With customization (including CEP) we have put together a server that tries to capture the flavour of the setting. Some Features of the Server: The People - In an RP setting, the people are as important as anything else. Custom Classes - Altered to fit the flavour of the setting as much as possible. No animal companions or familiars and such. Custom Spell System - Linking, Angreal and Learning through watching have all been implemented. Custom Treasure System - Extremely random, endless possibilities at higher level chests. Setting Based Monsters - Even those that are questionable, such as zombies, are given setting based names, like Diseased Darkfriend, Shadar Logothian and such. CEP Trollocs, Fades, Drahkar, Gholam, as well as some of the Seanchan exotics add to Dragonsworn, bandits and others. Beautiful setting, Factions, Intrigue.
