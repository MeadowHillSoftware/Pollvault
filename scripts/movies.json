I'm not sure if this is a bink Raw or Bink Self Executing (not sure about the difference). I tried to be as proffesional as I could, although in my opinion it is rather poor. But, don't all authors say that? I think they do from time to time. Anyway, expect a highly storyline based game, filled with combat, and intrigue soon! Made an update due to some feedback.

The module is pretty much done � all that is left is implementation of a henchman, teleport stone and a complete test run. Godslayer is inspired by Norse mythology and it contains supernatural locales, creatures and stories that match those that are identified in the myths. During their quest, the players will have an opportunity to battle demonic hordes, complete various puzzles and trials of character and face Norse gods of good and evil. There are also two alternate endings for good and evil characters. The entire module was made using basic NWN tools, so that expansion packs or additional custom HAK files will not be necessary to download.

Sadly, in order to keep the file size manageable, I had to really reduce the quality of this movie, the Flash file was like 2 megs tops, but the AVI was around 80 with little compression... Sad... It still came out rather nice however, and is great for getting people in the mood for the module this movie is intended for. also note that the credits at the end of the film won't be updated... The main differences is that 2 of the hak paks I orriginally was using ended up not meshing with what I wanted properly later on, so they needed to be removed, the two in question are the 100 outdoor placeables (wish I could have kept them without editing .2da's, I loved the trees), and the horse/donkey/wagon hak. I also discovered Lady bloods all in one LOTR hak, and replaced the witchhaven pack, with the all in one. thats about it, otherwise no other changes where made.","Rating":9,"Awards":[]},"337":{"Title":"The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth Intro","Author":"Jhani","Submitted":20030202,"Updated":20030203,"Category":"Trailers","Movie Format":"Bink Raw","Description":"My first attempt at an opening movie for the upcoming PNP conversion The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.

Updated movie coming soon. (6/24/06)\n\nOne of Lynncair�s most well-known legends is that of Nabul Gyrazzi, Hazumar Falarim, and the Shardstaff. It is said that Gyrazzi, an archmage and a specialist at the enchantment of artifacts of power, poured his soul into the creation of an item he called the Shardstaff--in the process, he imbued it with power beyond imagination. The Shardstaff was said to be able to call forth lightning from the heavens, conjure blizzards of biting cold, and invoke swarms of meteors to burn one�s foes to cinders--it was Gyrazzi�s greatest creation, and his last.\n\nThe story goes that upon completing the Shardstaff, Gyrazzi, weak after his great exertion, collapsed to the floor in exhaustion. It is said that Hazumar Falarim, Gyrazzi�s apprentice at the time, entered his master�s study and murdered Gyrazzi while he was weakened and vulnerable--Hazumar took the Shardstaff, and was never heard from again.\n\nLegend has it that Hazumar lives still, sustained by the powers of the Shardstaff--some say that he resides in the maze-like caves beneath the forbidding Amon-Dur Mountains, while others believe that he lives somewhere inside of the Desert of Ash--some go so far as to hypothesize that Hazumar fled to another plane of existence, where he could pursue his magical studies undisturbed.\n\nOne thing is certain; not a single reliable clue, hint or sign has been found that sheds any light on the mystery of what happened to Hazumar or the legendary Shardstaff...Until now.\n\nAny questions or comments should be directed to alex@hugon.com or posted on this page.

The shtrigas' origin is still a mystery, although it seems to be some kind of powerful curse that turns dead females into monsters. Some people say that evil, cruel and wicked women � like witches or murderers � have a chance to become shtrigas. Others claim that the curse affects all prematurely dead children who are a result of adultery or incest. One thing is certain: every full moon, the female undead will rise from the grave to prey on the living. There is also a myth that if some fearless daredevil spends an entire night in a shtriga's tomb, the curse will end and the monster will be turned back into a living woman. But even the most powerful witchers don't dare to do this and simply prefer to kill the monster as quick as possible.
