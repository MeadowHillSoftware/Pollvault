I'm really sick of people taking sewers and turning it into a wild labyrinth/dungeon. It's just not right. The corridors and bridges have some sounds attached to them, mainly at the sludgy water. There are also climbable ladders at some little tabs of ground which are sort of like what you may see today. Light pours through the grate above. I included a script with some basic instructions to make the ladders fully functional. Ladder/Light placeables, script, and the sounds are supported in this version. Change as you see fit.

Combat geared towards approx matching levels, but with enough class, race, and skill variance to make betting a challenge. Both module and import file provided, plus extensive module regarding the product. Large zip file, about 7 meg, but well worth it. Single-User only, multi-user to come in future.

No I haven't added any credit to anyone since I haven't ripped anything. I just added a Read me explaining where I got the sources for em. So if you already made the items, sorry but the credit goes to the source book and not me and not anyone that claims to have invented that unique item or item made from a certain material. So instead of trying to get credit for things give the credit for the D20 people and the people that made the source books. I didn't want any credit why I didn't put any text files. I just wanted people to have access to as many D&D items that exist officially.

The name pops up in a few places, most of which are item descriptions. I placed a few people around as demonstartions of how they look, and I am quite pleased with some of the people. The only NPC with a conversation is the merchant, and I included responses for both intelligent and unintelligent characters. He will sell the equipment that you can currently see on display, as well as a few items you can't. (variants of the 2 wizards' staves, a few rings, and the warriors' helmets.) I included some more info in the attached readme file, and I only wish a little feedback so I can make some more stuff that might be desired. The glowing altar area is intended to be a respawn portal, but I can't script so I left that to the module maker.I used the PC Pack v2 by Redcap, so in order for some of the armor to look right, (female wizard's robe) you will need either the pack, or Lisa's 3 outfits DK. You could always just change the appearance to make it look right if you don't want to download these. I also attached a robe I created as a separate .erf to the .zip file since it doesn't really fit with the theme of the area. I used Redcap's PC-Pack V2 for the Shadow Wizard Robe, so you will need more than just Lisa's hak for this one. Since I don't know exactly what pieces came from what, you'll probably need the PC-Pack to see it correctly. The robe is made up of pieces from the PC-Pack, no custom models from me, and I put more explanation about it in the Readme. There should be 3 files in the .zip, merc_outpost.erf, shadowwizardrobe.erf, and Readme for the Mercenary_Outpost.txt if these are not in the file, it is a very small download.","Rating":9,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"337":{"Title":"Midden & outhouse","Author":"Thameron","Submitted":20021208,"Updated":20021208,"Category":"Areas","Focus":"Areas","Area":"Castles","Description":"What room does every house have but is extremely rare in RP game universes?

It is for use with the PRC Pack, which includes the MMM spell. This replacement requires the CEP 1.50 or higher because all the 'food' placeables come from there (which is one good reason it cannot be included in the PRC Pack itself). It employs (and includes) a slightly modified version of Jacob's Self-Righting Sittable Placeables v1.2. Please be sure to overwrite the jh_sit_onused script if the module already contains one, or the characters may sit backward on one set of chairs. This does not break compatibility with the regular version; it just turns the character around if the chair has a particular variable. I did this because some of Bioware's chair models are backward, including one that I used, and Jacob's chair scripts can't tell otherwise.The beds have 'Restful Bed' objects on them which are specifically for modules that use Supply Based Resting, so characters can sleep without having to use supplies (the PHB states that MMM comes with plenty of food and such). They should do no harm in modules without it, since activating one will just make the character rest without checking for supply kits.

It is hallucinogenic, and mildly toxic to other races. Gnomes, haflings and elves are most resistant to the hallucinogenic effect, then half-elves, then all other races. The wine is of interest to certain sages, because of the implications for the relationships between races: perhaps dwarves aren't the closest relatives of gnomes, as is often claimed?

Nearly everything in the areas can be used by the player character! Take the time to explore and try everything out when you play. Extensive use of the Aurora Editor 'Invisible Object' item has allowed even graphic area-drawn items to be incorporated into game play. Certain area-drawn graphical objects, such as the bookcases and the second floor wardrobe, required their 'trigger' to be placed on the floor in such a way that at least some of the drawn object is covered by their area of influence. Every usable object has an appropriate 'examine' description, as well. The only objects currently unusable are the large corner cabinet on the first floor (there is a barrel in front of it) and, of course, the upstairs beds.Take special note of the process involved in preparing a meal on the first floor, and the 'washing' ritual that can occur on the second floor. UPDATE: 07/23/2003 - This version of the Player House adds a roommate to the mix! Meet Alana; an NPC roommate of the player house. I have instituted some simple, needs-based assessment routines to give her an AI feel to her actions. She will roam the house, eat when she's hungry, wash when she's dirty, and so on. And, if that wasn't enough, Alana has a pet dog, as well, who uses similar scripts and is self-controlled. Each of these characters and their scripts are self-contained, so if you want to use the house without them, all you have to do is delete the characters. Enjoy!

I made this so that other users/modders/DMs with more experience and free time than I have could use it in their modules and have some humorous fun. Anyone can feel free to edit and modify this as much as they want, so long as the original credit comes back to me. Due to time constraints I may never be able to post an update, but I'll try to get custom portaits and some alternative scripts up here soon.Download the .erf, place in your erf folder and then import it into your module to use.

Every builder has their own game world with its own level of magic balance and history. By not having any description/magic properties these items can be used in any game world without the builder having to go through every item and remove things that are inappropriate for their game world. I find it takes more time to make the item look good than it does to build the properties/description. With this prefab you can quickly grab an item with an appearance similar to what you are imagining. Then it is fairly simple to change the properties/descriptions to something appropriate for your world.

This is the default setting for this switch so if you have not changed it, then you shouldn't have to worry about it. The weapon requires specific ammunition in order to utilize its enhanced behavior. The reason for this is because the scripting is executed as an OnHit event for the ammo, since there is no OnHit for the crossbow itself. You don't have to use the special ammo, but if you don't then it will function just like a regular +1 Heavy Crossbow. The ammo could also be used with a normal crossbow, but it will not have its enhanced behavior, so that is kind of an expensive waste.

It reverts to the base item when unequipped. The dagger does not level up while wielded - it does it at the time it is equipped. The base dagger can be wielded by anybody, it just doesn't level up for non-wizards. The erf includes the base dagger (two versions, one normal and one already identified), 9 leveled up versions of the dagger (1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, 30th, 35th, and 40th), and all the scripts I used.\n\nThis item and scripts was created as an experiment that actually worked.

Approach the glowing tree within the mod, and a Fairy will appear and plea for help.\n\nThe basic plot is that the tree, home to the fairies, is dieing, due to a nest of insects under the roots. The insects have bored through the roots and the Fairies are only just holding them back. They can't squeeze through the hole to destroy the nest as they'd damage their wings, and so offer to shrink the player so that he/she can enter the tree and help them.\n\nThe top of the tree has been kept empty to do with as you please, but note you should ensure no takeable items are present except the custom fairy spears, as these are the only items shrunk on leaving the tree.\n\nEncounters are respawnable and the quest has been built with multiple visits from different characters in mind, but this will require the insect nest to be made respawnable in order to be functional, and some way of ensuring there are always Fairies on the roots level to fight the insects. Sorry, this was beyond my skills, but I have placed some Pixies to get the feel across, so it should function as a single player add on with no problem.\n\nIn its current state the Druid/Ranger may not take a party with them.\n\nA big thankyou to rdjparadis for helping me greatly with the spears shrinking if you leave the tree.\n\nThere's a couple of nice touches, including life size fairies to give the illusion of having been shrunk.\nHope you like this offering and put it to good use.

Think that these little pesky creatures are a walk in the park? These little guys don't survive by their good looks and charm, but by cunning and lots of traps.

Filled with lots of good old fashion traps, fortifications, loot, and of course kobolds these caverns will give even a bit more experienced adventurer a bit more challenge than they would expect when they hear the word \"Kobolds\". The lair contains a tourture room and cell block, throne room, quarters naturally, a shrine to Kurtuluk, hatchery for the young, and a surprise awaiting the unsuspecting at the bottom of the caverns. I know the players on my server have enjoyed these caves greatly and I hope perhaps it can help someone else out as well. The download contains 4 areas total.

This module was designed so that builders of all skill levels; ranging from beginners, to experts; can easily start their own playerworld without the hassel of searching for the HCR, and combining it with other commonly used systems.\n\n\nIt has several \"bells and whistles,\" so to speak, tho it is up to the builder to adjust the settings to his or her specification. Simply build your desired areas, add the spawns / conversations / and other desired content and play. Builder Notes, and system ReadMe files are included. \n\nAll credit goes to the below scripts, and their talented authors. This is simply a combinatation of their works.\n\n\nQuestion: What is HCR?\nAnswer: HCR (Hard Core Ruleset) is a set of scripts, items, and placeables that allow Neverwinter Nights to be closer to 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons rules. It makes the game much more realistic in regards to bleeding, eating, drinking, restingï¿½ and dying.\n\n\nRequired Hak(s):\nCEP 1.52\n\n\nCurrent core script contents:\nCEP Crafting (Comes with CEP in an erf.)\nDMFI HotU DM Wand Package v1_07\nHCR V3.04\nPresistance Facade\nPurple Rose Inn V1.2.0\nJasperre's AI 1.3\nNeshke's Extendable Spawning System (NESS) 8.1.3\nLasCivious Area Clean Up\nMerchant Clean 2.0\nAnother Pack Ox\nPersistent Player Item Storage 1.00 - using Bioware campaign database\nUpdated PC Scry\nFRAGILE CONTENTS SYSTEM Version 1.1\n\n\nThis uses NWN with all expansions (SoU, HotU) patch 1.66, along with the default Bioware database. Run as a standalone server, or with NWNX. Can be switched to use MySql. I believe instructions are available on the HCR forums at http://www.neises.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=39\n\nDont let the script list above scare you, it's all fairly simple and effective. Easy to remove/disable unwanted features. \n\nQuestions? Comments? I'd be glad to answer any you may have.\n\n\n(Update: April 5, 06) Overhauled the Prefab Core. Updated scripting to latest versions, added new systems, and added system readme files. Waiting for release of Shayan's Subrace Engine 2.7.\n\n\n(Minor Update: June 16, 05) Added CEP link to above description. Core update planned, deffinate additions includes a script add-in for anti-item duplicating, and the Dynamic Logbook. View the Discussion\n\n\n(Update: June 7, 05) Fixed minor problem with PC Scry. Server wouldnt see the widget in a players inventory. Added prestige class identifiers to PC Scry as well. \nNote - If you dont want players to be able to use the PC Scry widget to jump to the party leader, simply delete the conversation line for it in the c_pcl_activate conversation.\n\n\n(Update: June 4, 05) Removed Alkaia's Deity System. Wouldnt work properly.. problem with persistance? Further detailed included notes. Re-added the Purple Rose Inn area, didnt realize it was deleted. Added latest HCR 3.3b updates.

Installing it will cause a new entry called Killer Secret Object Trigger to be added into the NWN Toolset in the custom trigger palette under the Secret Object Triggers category. It also adds two entries called Killer Secret Object Location and Killer Secret Object Destination into the custom waypoint palette under the Waypoints category. The trigger uses a script called kso_trig_enter which is added to the module's script list.\n\nThis package allows you to easily add pre-scripted secret object detection triggers and waypoints into your module that will simplify the task of creating secret objects that must be detected to be seen or found. It encapsulates the Bioware default secret object triggers, placeables, and waypoints into one easy to use trigger, and two easy to use waypoints. All the scripting is taken care of for you. The trigger allows you to select one of the standard Bioware secret objects to use or you can make your own and easily connect it to the Killer Secret Object Trigger. The trigger is pre-scripted to handle the detection checks, manage the secret placeable (reveal/spawn it and hide/destroy it at the appropriate time), and reset itself for the next guy.\n\nWhen you use Killer Secret Object Triggers instead of the Bioware standard ones, not only can you either select from the standard secret objects or create custom ones of your own, you will also have available some new extensions to Bioware's standard concerning how detections are done and when detection is restricted or impossible. For example, you can easily set hours during the day or night when nobody can detect the object. Basically an inactive period for the trigger based on the game's time-of-day. If you would rather use a skill check other than Search to find the object, or if you want to base the detection on the level attained in a particular class, it takes like 10 seconds to set it up. You can also set up a special Key object requirement that makes the trigger be inactive to anybody that isn't carrying one (a nice feature for making a hidden entrance to a guild area that only members of the guild can detect, or other such ideas). If you want to change your trigger to use a different secret object you won't have to delete the trigger to make a new different one or change a bunch of script names around. Just flip a switch and boom you're hiding a different object.\n\nSee Readme file for instructions on using Killer Secret Objects.\n","Rating":10,"Votes":9,"Awards":["Community Contribution Award 2007"]},"711":{"Title":"Hat of Disguise v2","Author":"The Amethyst Dragon","Submitted":20051020,"Updated":20091203,"Category":"Items","AC":"N/A","Weight":"2","Magical":"Yes","Damage Type":"N/A","Damage":"N/A","Other":"N/A","Cost":"2500 gp","Type":"Helmet/Hat","Focus":"Misc. magical item that anybody can use (3rd level needed if using ILR)","Weapons":"N/A","Armor":"Helmet","Properties":"Changes wearer's appearance","Area":"N/A","Items":"N/A","Forums":"Link","Description":"When donned, this hat allows the wearer to disguise his or her physical appearance (while retaining any other normal qualities) as another humanoid creature.\n\nThe illusion can be ended at any time by the wearer (by using the hat again, by removing it, or by attacking).\n\nBack in late 2005, I didn't see one of these anywhere on the Vault (and I had a use for one in my PW module), so I have created my version of the Hat of Disguise (HOD).\n\nWhen worn, the wearer can use it to select one of many alternate forms to appear as (so long as your PC is one of the 7 standard racial appearances...the hat has to know what to turn you back into, and subraces with custom skins aren't a constant included in the published game).\n\nThe change is purely cosmetic and does not affect abilities, powers, item use, etc. The change lasts until cancelled by using the wearer, until the Hat of Disguise is unequipped, or the wearer attacks another creature (breaking the illusion).\n\nI've found a game use for this by having certain creatures with a generally neutral faction (a kingdom of orcs) instantly turn hostile towards PCs that don't at least appear to be orcs or half-orcs. This is done in a customized onPerception script in my module.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nVersion 2 - August 8, 2008\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the release of the 1.69 patch for NWN came the built-in ability to grab information from the chat bar via the OnPlayerChat event and scripts. I've updated the Hat of Disguise to take advantage of this to reduce the number of scripts needed while expanding on the both the number of forms available and the ease of use of the item (since it no longer needs to be \"activated\", using up a round, then more time finding the right appearance in a conversation).\n\nThis updated version looks for a certain chat-typed command starting with \"hod \", then uses that to control the helm. The one your players should know is \"hod help\", which will tell them how to use the item and find out the appearances possible.\n\nYou can easily modify which appearances are available by changing the \"hod_onchat\" script. I picked forms that are basically humanoid and generic to keep variety with simplicity. Any shape is possible, even the mightiest of dragons if you as a builder/scripter desire, but since I aim for a closer-to-D&D feel, I stuck with humanoids of roughly PC size.\n\nTo use this version, simply download the HatofDisguise_v2 (.rar, .zip, or .7z) file and decompress into you ERF directory, the follow the directions in the readme file.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nVersion 1 - October 20, 2005\n-------------------------------------------------\nThe available forms: orc, kobold, goblin, drow, lizardman, hobgoblin, dwarf, elf, human, gnome, halfling, half-orc, human child, old human, zombie, skeleton, mummy. Some of the forms vary depending on the gender of the wearer.\n\nThis was made with version 1.66 of NWN with both SoU and HotU, it may not be compatible with older versions of the game.\n\nThis .erf contains the HOD item (found under Armor > Helmets), the HOD conversation file, all the HOD scripts, and altered default5 and defaultb (onPhysicalAttacked/onSpellCastAt scripts).

All the famous places are here: the Ishtar Gate, the Hanging Gardens, the great ziggurat known in biblical times as the Tower of Babel, the Royal Palace and much, much more have been faithfully re-created with exacting detail, while only the most necessary of liberties were taken. For instance, whereas the actual city had hundreds of gates, and eight major ones leading into the city, I simplified my Babylon by having the Ishtar Gate being the only main gate into the city, and a more reasonable amout within. Also, I based the layout of the city on a map from the time of Alexander the Great, which I saw in a book I own. Not every area was shown on the map, so I did a great deal of research to make each of the city's districts correct. For the Prison, I wanted to portray something of the ancient Babylonians' reputation for being merciless to their foes. As for the Necropolis, that came from a legend that said how in it's declining years, some parts of Babylon fell into ruins and were sometimes used to house the dead, when not just left to wild beasts. My Necropolis area reflects the legends well, but wild beasts are not included. Lol. Where history is silent I went by archeological information as well as Biblical accounts. All in all, this is a must-have for those who like to build modules set in historical or Biblical times.

Having been inspired by Primogenitor's area map generator, I went out to see if it's possible to create one in a rural area.\n\nThis area is a potential example of a worldmap area that I will use in my DMed campaign and wanted to share. This particular method can only really be used in a DMed campaign, although with clever script-writing, I can assume that it might also be able to be used for a single-player campaign.\n\nThe idea is that the players get a general idea of what the layout of the land is, as well as to how far the party is travelling. A brownie creature is used to represent the party, while placeables denote areas of interest. As was pointed out to me, brownie creatures might also be used to show different groups travelling the land, like small armies. Depending on the party's feedback, the DM possesses the party creature, and moves him towards the new area.\n\nIf a player enters the area, his appearance is changed to null, and reset to his original state upon leaving the area. This is to avoid having characters who seem out of place walking around on the worldmap. No changes are made to a DM.\n\nThe CEP is required to properly show the map.

You can find it by itself, or chop it from dead logs, or cut down trees. \n3) No lighting firewood without being a ranger, druid, or having a torch in your hand. The wind tends to blow out torches earlier than normal...\n4) The campfires will eventually burn out, or you can put them out. Either way, they leave an ash mark. \n5) Druids automatically start with an item called \"Detect Creatures\" which was inspired by a Ranger Tracks script I found in this vault. When used, the Druid will point to the nearest living creature, invisible or not, and be able to identify the basic type (undead, animal, outsider, etc) of all creatures within range (range based on the druid's level) and give a rough direction. Druids cannot detect other druids or rangers. \n6) There is a premade trigger called Ranger Tracks. Anyone besides a druid or ranger who walks through this trigger, will leave tracks for 10 minutes. For the first 5 minutes, those tracks can be identified by rangers (by walking through the trigger). After that, rangers can detect them (by walking through the trigger), but can't ID what sort of creature made them. \n7) The placeable trees, when attacked, fight back through vines and roots that attempt to entangle the attacker and transform them into a tree. \n8) There is also a small creature called a twig ent roaming around stealthfully, protecting the trees as well. \n\nFeel free to give suggestions, and I can tweak it...

I have now created them for NWN just wanted to see what they would look like. ( Decided not to use CEP ).\n\nHammer of Glory\n\nThis potent hammer is the work of the gods, or so thought. The real creator was a one-eyed dwarven metal smith named Cramdor. \n\nCramdor died whilst making the hammer for a dwarven champion who fought to rid their homelands of the giant marauders, that were rampaging throughout the countryside. \n\nHis soul binded with the hammer not wishing to fail his fellow dwarves, and made the weapon you now hold. \n\nThe weapon's magic is so potent it will slay any Giantine creature on contact. It was also said any warrior using the weapon became like the mountain itself. \nTruly a sight to behold...\n\nThe Staff of Maggots \n\nThis artifact was first found by the archmage Promithian The Black. It's creation is however unknown, but surely the work of some dark forgotten god. \n\nThe weapon itself is a horror to look upon, for it writhes with maggots upon it's shaft. Striking oppnents can cause the maggots to dislodge, upon such an event the maggot mutates, and attacks the target. The maggots however die soon after they fall from the staff.\n\nThe staff also has the power to summon the dead, these undead are powerful guardians. For this reason Promithian soon became known only as The Master.\n\nThe Staff's power imbues it bearer with greater arcane knowledge, while also allow him to speak in dead silence.\n\nThe Staff can once a day cast a bolt of devastating power, that will render an opponent to nothing but ahses.\n\nThe Black Bow\n\nThe bow of devastation, created by Lord Dartenell in his campaign against The Krellim. \n\nThe Bow creates arrows of Fire and Lightning ( the only two forms of damage known to harm the Krellim Beasts), it has been told that his faith in the weapon allowed him to see the beasts even after they have vanished from sight.\n\nIn his fight against The Krellim Queen, Lord Dartenell was able to resist the Queen's evil charms and spells, and with the bow manifested a missle of such power it blasted The Queen from exsistence.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"728":{"Title":"Magical Combat Dummy","Author":"hitch","Submitted":20051209,"Updated":20051215,"Category":"Other","Type":"placable","Description":"This is a dummy that records, and reports back what damage has been done to it via a phisical attack.

That splendor has been captured perfectly in the Dreaming\nCity and it's gleaming spires, from out of which the emperors reigned and nobles\nschemed. The Straasha harbor beheld the Dragon Princes sailing to war in their battle barges, as it reached out from the Foreign Quarter, which housed the wealthy merchants of the city as well as visitors who braved many dangers to find themselves guests of their inhuman hosts. Beyond the harbor, lay the Sea Caves... where countless ships of many enemy nations ultimately met their end.\nEncircling the northernmost districts of the city is the vast plain of Imrryr which was home to the rich Melnibonean peasants... whose plantations made them\nno less wealthy than the merchants. And no visit to Melnibone can be complete, without a trip to the Intangible Forest and the spectacular vistas, of the two shorelines... as well as the old Dragon Caves, which were the lair of the Great Dragons which gave the isle it's title: the Dragon Isle. (No NPCs were added)\n \n- Full info on exactly how to reach the Sea Caves, and then travel beyond them, can be found witin the enlcosed Readme file. If you enjoyed Pan Tang then you will love this latest prefab... and if you have never checked out any of my prefabs before, then this is a perfect place to start.

Those familiar with the book of Revelation will be equally pleased to see depicted here the Seven Lampstands, the Rainbow around the Divine Throne, the 24 Seats, and the floor being like unto glass, or crystal, as some Bible translations have it. Compare now the following verses, and see how close:\n\nRevelation 4:1 - \"I looked, and, behold: a door was opened in heaven!\"\n*** The doors I placed at the entrance to the Temple Divine represent this. ***\n \nRevelation 4:3 - \"There was a rainbow round the throne, in colour like unto an emerald in sight of the throne.\"\n*** The colored light shafts and magic sparks produce the effect exactly. ***\n\nRevelation 4:4 - \"Round about the throne were four and twenty seats.\"\n*** You can find all of these spread out before the throne, all usable. ***\n\nRevelation 4:5 - \"Out of the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices: and there were seven lampstands of fire burning before the throne, the seven Spirits of God.\"\n*** I found the perfect sound effects for the lightning, thunder, voices...\nit's set up for magic chants to sound the closer you get to the throne, in fact! Standard candelabra placeables, with flames high above them did the trick for the seven lampstands and the seven Spirits. It looks convincing! ***\n\nRevelation 4:6 - \"And before the throne there was a sea of glass like crystal.\"\n*** The very reason picked the tileset that I did to represent this place was that the Frozen Wastes have the crystal looking walls and floor. But the Wastes have probably never been used for any interior setting like this before! ***\n\nRevelation 5:1 - \"At the right hand of him that sat upon the throne: a book sealed with seven seals.\"\n*** That big book on the pedestal, to the right (your left) of the throne is intended to represent this book. ***\n\nYou can see the accuracy with which I have designed this prefab, and I truly\nhope players and builders alike will appreciate the fine attention to detail\nin even the little things that all make this prefab a place worth visiting.\n\nPackage contains an .erf ready to add into any CEP-compatible module, and a demo module as well, so you can see how everything is set up in-game. \n\n ","Rating":9.7,"Votes":27,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"750":{"Title":"Tropical Island Village","Author":"Tenuei","Submitted":20060116,"Updated":20060119,"Category":"Areas","Type":"Island Village","Description":"A small island village made from the Mines & Caverns tileset and a lot of placeables.

By a miracle she drifted to shore on the edge of the Jarik Glacier. There she was found and rescued by fae from the Winter Court. Once she had healed she was brought before the Queen who asked her what favor she could provide in return for her well being. Having nothing more to offer than her skills, Alriel offered to play for the Queen's court until her debt had been repaid. So impressed was the Queen of the Winter Court with the talents of the young bard that she summoned fabled Frostgaze, an incredibly old dragon, to bring forth a wondrous gift from its lair in the Cliffs of Jamar. Frostgaze collected many musical delights in its hoard for the winds that batter the Jamar coastline to play, but the wind could not play Icesinger and so it brought the flute at the request of the Winter Queen. Alriel returned to her people with the flute, using it to cross the sea with its icy song. Since then, the flute has traveled from one bard's hand to the next, staying upon the Jarik Glacier.\n Crafted from the claw of a white dragon and infused with the spirit of an ice paraelemental, this flute has powers over water and cold. It appears as a bone white flute that glimmers in sunlight with coursing blue waves beneath its surface. When played well it alights with eldritch blue fire and the nearby air becomes noticibly colder. It is glossy smooth and cool to the touch, making it slightly more difficult to play than a normal flute.\"\n-(From World of Sulerin Campagn)\n\n(Song Duration works like standard bard songs, affected by lingering song and lasting inspiration)","Rating":9.67,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"752":{"Title":"A Pair of Potions","Author":"Kilana","Submitted":20060116,"Updated":20060116,"Category":"Items","Magical":"Yes","Cost":"Cold Forge Oil: 750gp\nOil of the Firewalker: 1500gp","Type":"Potions","Description":"Cold Forge Oil\n*excerpt*\n \"Cold Forge Oil was created by the dwarves of Silverstreak for use against the unseelie fey during the Faerie Wars.

There are only two blueprints, one for the deck and another is a template for all cards to be based on. Iï¿½m sorry, but DMs cannot spawn specific cards- no divine intervention in your poker games, Iï¿½m afraid ;)\n- By default modules should run scripts based on item tags, allowing you to import the ERF and start dealing. If you do not have tag-based item scripts and need help, Iï¿½m sure there are threads elsewhere that can help you.\n\n(The items themselves have relevant information in their descriptions.)\n\n- The deck of cards, when incomplete, is Plot and cannot be sold by players, as it stores by variable the cards it possesses, which would be lost in a merchant. Since a deck of cards cannot be sold, neither can individual cards. This cannot be changed. NOTE: \"A Sealed Deck of Cards\" can be sold, and its first use will initialize the deck. When a deck has all 52 cards, it becomes \"A Full Deck of Cards\" and can be sold.\n- Players cannot add more than one instance of a card to a deck.\n\n- A deck can do the following after being initialized:\n-- Target self: Deal a card to yourself.\n-- Target ground: Place a card at the targeted location.\n-- Target player: Deal a card to the target player. ONLY works on players and DMs. Add the module variable \"CARDS_NPC\" (int) and set to 1 to allow dealing to NPCs. This will fire the NPCï¿½s OnDisturbed event, if you want the NPC to do something with the card right away.\n\n- A card, when dealt, is face-down, and can do the following:\n-- Target owner: Look at the card\n-- Target player: Reveal the card to the target player. If you want an NPC to make use of this, use OnSpellCastAt to make the NPC react, using the last item activated and getting the local variables \"SUIT\" (a string) and \"VALUE\" (an int).\n-- Target card (self): Flip the card over, changing its name to either \"A Face-down Card\" or \"A (Value) of (Suit)\".\n-- Target deck: Attempt to add the card to the target deck.\n\nI hope you and your players find it useful, fun and easy to use :)","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"822":{"Title":"Commoner's Clothing","Author":"WeaponD","Submitted":20060622,"Updated":20060625,"Category":"Armor","Type":"Clothing","Description":"9 different custom made outfits for commoners, using the standard game resources and the CEP.

I liked the Fallen vampire system, but wanted something more along the lines of the White Wolf World of Darkness. A world where powerful PCs can Masquerade as humans even to each other. \nIn this PW shell, everyone starts human or humanoid (I'd recommend humans only, actually). Vampires and werewolves are mostly created by other PCs, and gain powers as they go up in levels. PC vampires can create ghouls out of other PCs or NPCs to serve them. All vampire powers are fueled by a Blood Pool, which they can only fill by feeding off others. PC werewolves have 4 different beast forms, and can smell different types of creatures nearby, even invisible ones. Unlike the other horrors, a werewolf can Step Sideways into the Spirit World to seek refuge and gather power. Meanwhile, the civilians of the city are all infected with The Sickness. If they die, they rise as zombies. If you fight a zombie, they could infect your open wounds as well. If you don't find the cure soon...And finally, if you die the True Death, you are sent to the Shadowlands to wander as a Wraith. At night, you might be able to cross back over to the land of the living, completely unseen. You could harvest their dreams for power, create poltergeist effects, spy on them, or perhaps summon enough strength to actually manifest before them. This Prefab contains a few mandatory areas (underground, The ShadowLands, and the SpiritWorld) and two others to demonstrate what all this prefab can do. Spells work differently on PCs who are undead (vampires, zombies or wraiths). Some zombies can appear human only in daylight, but reveal their true nature at dusk (like Pirates of the Carribean). Some Wraiths can manifest forms close enough to real that they actually appear alive, but only throughout the night. Ghouls are humans who can drink blood for power and serve vampires, and all vampires and werewolves look normal too, until they want to appear otherwise... I created this to beta test the scripts for a PW I hope to create in NWN2. It is a shell to create a world designed for role-playing hidden secrets and fighting the beast within... Also, I accidentally uploaded the 'backupmod' the first go round. Now it is just the mod itself... Fixed first bug that kept \"haunts\" from working (Thanks chaos_theocrat!)\n\nUpdated -- Fixed the 2nd bug on \"meld\" and \"step sideways\" (again, thank you Chaos), and, just for you Rapid, I've added a second version. This new version I THINK is now persistent. It is my first go at making a persistent world system, so rather than replacing the first one, I made a second version. That way we can trouble shoot the second without damaging the original. Both versions have the Chaos bugs fixed. \nUpdated 12Sep06 -- Now the zip file ONLY contains the persistent version, which has the meld, step sideways, and haunt issues fixed... \n\nIncidentally, this mod's persistence is built around Knat's Natural Bioware Database Extension 1.0\n\nUpdated 22Sep06 -- NOW 13% more Persistenty! Added a \"limbo\" room that will send you back to your last location if someone resets the module, and also will only allow humans to play (but can be adjusted to allow other races). Up to 5 henchman will reform with you if the module resets as well. If you were a staked vampire before, now you'll stay staked when the module resets. Also, if you are a Wraith in the real world, it will make you ghost-like again after a server reset. If you were a zombie, you'll be one again after a server reset. If you are a vampire melded into the ground, or a vampire in wolf form, you'll be after a server reset. Also, fixed the bug Maerik discovered about fangs getting blood from the floor.

Players are taken to a world map screen that shows the world they are adventuring in, where they can then click on area icons that jump them to the various areas. A world map system is an excellent idea for builders who have many areas to travel between in their module, and wish to give players a better visualization of where they are currently located or how they are progressing across the world.\n\nIncluded in this download are 4 things:\n\n1) A detailed instruction manual written by Brian Watson (aka MadWombat) for getting the world map system working in your mod (includes images).\n\n2) A stand-alone demo module of the world map system (ï¿½Darkness over Daggerfordï¿½ not required).\n\n3) An erf file for importing the necessary world map scripts and blueprints into your mod.\n\n4) A hak containing select demo world map resources from ï¿½Darkness over Daggerford.ï¿½\n\nRequirements: \n1) The 1.67 patch (or greater) must be installed.\n\nWe hope Ossianï¿½s world map system can increase the enjoyment of whatever NWN mod you are working on!\n\n---\nwww.ossianstudios.com\n","Rating":9.99,"Votes":30,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"895":{"Title":"Large Empty Maze","Author":"Aversinia","Submitted":20060917,"Updated":20060917,"Category":"Areas","Type":"Maze - prefab","Description":"16x16 maze.

However, from time to time, I would recommend it nonetheless. To reset the device, cast Flare on it. To see which spells are stored, cast Electric Jolt on it. The item is not usable in combat. It is meant as a time safer, not for cheating.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"899":{"Title":"CEP v2.0 +CTP v1.0 Combined v1.0","Author":"Sharon Tipton","Submitted":20060927,"Updated":20061001,"Category":"Areas","Type":"Combination Module","Forums":"Link","Description":"CTP v1.0+ CEP v2.0 Combined.\n \n \nRequires the following haks:\n \nctp_bio_fix\nctp_common\nctp_loadscreens\nctp_generic_doors\nctp_blk_desert\nctp_brick_int\nctp_cave_ruins\nctp_dungeon_lok\nctp_dwarf_hall\nctp_elf_interior\nctp_exp_elf_city\nctp_goth_estate\nctp_goth_int\nctpr_dungeon\ncep2_top_v1\ncep2_add_phenos2\ncep2_add_phenos1\ncep2_add_tiles\ncep2_add_sb_v1\ncep2_core5\ncep2_core4\ncep2_core3\ncep2_core2\ncep2_core1\n\nThis is the order the haks are in for this module without any issues. \nYou also must have cep2_v1.tlk in your tlk folder.\n \nCTP v1.0 can be found here.\nhttp://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=hakpaks.Detail&id=6992&comment_page=1\n\nCEP v2.0 can be found here.\nhttp://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=hakpaks.Detail&id=7000\n\nThere is one file in this prefab. a .mod file with one area.

After that you can call it back with the horse widget.\n\nThis should give you all you need to easily include CEP 2 Horses in your modules.\n\nI am adding my Saddle bag system and custom persistant storage to the horses as it has been requested many times.\n\nConsider the saddle bags magical storage and the weight + size will not be a RP problem.\n\nAlso included is my flying system, complete with widgets, scripts, and conversation.\n\nFor those of you who have wanted these features, here they are. I will NOT limite the number of horse spawns, however you can easily do that yourself by changing the property on the widget item from infinate to whatever you desire.\n\nThank You All for you votes and for you support -- enjoy!\n\nFeb 2007 I am adding my pack animal system with the saddlebag persistant storage. There is a pack: Camel, Horse, Pony, and Ox. These are full henchmen with Animal companion type interface.\n\nIf you wish both a horse and an pack animal at the same time i suggest adding the single line to module on load that will allow you to add more henchmen -- you can set it to the number desired.\n\nyou can easily add this one line to your on module load script:\n\nSetMaxHenchmen(2);\n\nNote: 2 is the number of henchman currently set in this example script above -- that can be 3 or 4 or? Without that script command, the default is one (1) henchman.\n\n\n5/10/2007\nI made a change to the horse system which make it function far far better. I have removed the henchman horse and destroyed it upon mounting. When you unmount, you will need to use your horse widget to get the unmounted henchman horse\n\nOnce mounted there is no unmounted horse to cause trouble with script conflicts. Upon one unmounting, they use the horse widget to resummon the horse henchman. At least for my system this is working very very well. Noticable differences:\n\n1) No dead horses\n2) No orphined horses from crashes or log off\n3) No script conflicts\n4) No horses wandering about\n5) No restriction to resting while mounted - except you loose horse speed if you do so and need to dismount, remount to regain it.\n6) Party bar not spammed with all the henchmen horses while mounted\n\nTo upgrade just download the one mount script.\n\nI am once again uploading a working full mod with this version.\n\n\n7/12/2007 Tag based scripting integrated with the old system so both systems work nicely together.\n\nPeople keep talking about multiple horse spawn capability which has been addressed several times in past posts so I will put this here:\n\nI created this for MY needs. I require the multiple horse spawns - therefore it is NOT a flaw, it works as I designed it.\n\nIf you wish to limit numbers of horse spawns, you can change that in the widget/item properties. It is set at unlimited per day but you CAN change it to 1 per day, 2 per day, 3 per day, all the way up to 5 times per day -- it you your choice and easy to accomplish. \n\nJust NOTE -- the unlimited spawn is MY choice and is NOT broken or a fault of the system. If you wish something different you can easily change it but I did not make this to everyone's individual specifications, I made it to MY specifications for Annakolia, my PW.","Rating":9.92,"Votes":34,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"905":{"Title":"!!Ancient Forest!!","Author":"Novan TB","Submitted":20061005,"Updated":20061006,"Category":"Areas","Type":"Forest Area","Area":"One Forest Area","Description":"REQUIRES CEP v1.53!\nA Mysterious, Magical Ancient Forest.

This is NOT how the final playable module will be structured, encounter wise. You'll find lots of repetitive loot in the chests and such, as well as some very unique. This is not the way the final playable module will be, either. Loot in the real module will be much more diverse. The final plan was to set this up as part of my larger persistent world I'm building, and this particular part is essential to the drow/Underdark storyline going on in the final product, so you will find parts of plots in conversations that you'll have no way of figuring out or using in this prefab.

Pack horses are notoriously unreliable. They are poorly trained, mean, stubborn old cusses only moderately more useful as haulers as they would be as raw materials for glue. They certainly won't attack an enemy goblin on command, or just stand it's ground on command when it perceives a threat... and anyone who's ever tried to get one in from pasture will tell you they never, Never, NEVER come when you call them.\n\nThis simple system replaces the henchman inventory system with a new container item called an animal pack. Each pack animal can carry one animal pack. Players can take the animal pack from the animal via a conversation, load/unload it from/to their inventory, and then re-pack the animal. \n\nThese pack horses have only two modes: \"Stay here\" and \"Follow me\". They cannot be controlled using henchman commands. \n\nThis pack contains 2 creatures with conversations: A pack horse (STR 16) and a heavy pack horse (STR 18). \n\nIt contains the animal pack item. \n\nIt also contains a trigger that can be used to restrict the pack horse's movements. If the packhorse (identified by a small undroppable item in it's inventory) crosses into this trigger area it will wander off to the nearest \"Horse Grazing\" Waypoint (also included). This serves two functions:\n\n1. It can be used near doors and area transitions to forbid the pack horse from entering. \n\n2. It can be used to make the animal \"wander off\" as pack horses are wont to do from time to time. \n\nYou don't need to overwrite anything. These creatures use the bioware default script sets.

My goal was to make the system as simple as possible. I did very little scripting here. This is just an implementation of the CEP's system. \n\nCEP 2 Required\n\nI never understood why the CEP didn't bundle workable riding horses into their hacks. I've gone ahead and done it for my campaign, so I figured I can post it here for other noobs that want to implement it.\n\nThis erf includes three ridable horses (brown, white, and black). Just click on the horse and you will run up to it and mount it. \n\nIt also includes a script: \"at_cep_dismount\". This script can be placed on doors and other area transitions and will forbid characters from entering on horseback. Just put it in the \"on click\" event.\n\nIt also includes an undropable widget called \"riding skill\". This widget will allow a rider to dismount at will.\n\nLastly it includes a placeable called a \"hitching rail\". Anyone using the hitching rail while mounted will likewise dismount.\n\nNo need to overwrite anything. The creature blueprints use standard bioware scripts.\n\nVersion2: \nIncludes a new trigger called FuguePlaneDismount for use in \"death areas\". If you want to integrate this system into a game with a fugue plane (I use Axe Murderer's Killer Death System, or at least a varient of it) you will need to do some very simple scripting. Open the area properties for your purgatory or fugue plane and add or modify your OnEnter and OnExit scripts. \n\nOn enter you need to set a variable integer on the PC called \"DeathProccess1\" to 1, and you need to set it back to 0 on exit. \n\nNow, place the trigger called \"FuguePlaneDismount\" and place it around your death spawn point. \n\nVoila. Dead characters will be dismounted. If players attempt to mount a horse in the death area the animal will shy away in terror and vanish. \n\nI tried to create a script to destroy the dead horses, but it's going to take a better scripter than me to pull that one off. The dead players can destroy them by speaking with them before respawning. \n\nThis really isn't meant for a PW, but if you want to use it that way you will need to modify the action script in the \"ridablehorse\" conversation to throw some token XP at those willing to release the souls of the fallen steeds. This should keep your death area relatively free of horse droppings. \n______________________________\nJust got an Email from someone that wanted to now how to use the nightmare phenotype form CEP using ridables for dummies. It's wicked simple. Just add the \"ridablehorse\" conversation to the CEP creature. This conversation, the scripts, widgets, and placeable's will work with any of CEP's ridable phenotypes. To determine if a CEP phenotype is ridable just look at the creature properties/Basic/appearance. Ridable phenos are indicated by a *P1* in their appearance name. \n\nI'm not sure if the nightmare is a standard resource. If it is just make sure the appearance is \"Horse: Nightmare *P1*\" and add the \"ridablehorse\" conversation. If it's not obviously you need to create the creature in the creature wizard first. \n\nI'll include blueprints for all ridable horse phenotypes next time.

The delay seems to be on the order of a second or two from the time the conversation starts.

It allows players to buy, stable, and sell mounts. It includes templates for 4 riding horses and 3 warhorses. Stabled horses can also be traded with other players by using tokens. \n\nThis area requires that you have NWN patched to 1.69 and assumes that you have horses enabled in your module. For information on how to do this I recommend Proleric's NEVERWINTER NIGHTS 1.69 BUILDERS GUIDE TO HORSES & CREATURE SCALING available here:\nLink\n\nOverwrite all files. I have not changed any standard scripts. \n\nSaddlebags are enabled on most horses. Metal armored horses cannot carry saddlebags. 150 lbs. of armor and a rider is more than enough weight for the poor beast, don't you think? Of course if you disable saddlebags in your mod that will override the horse templates. \n\nIn the 1.69 default horse templates all barding is AC 3. My templates change this. Different barding has different armor levels. \n\nLeather Ac 2\nChain Ac 3\nPlate Mail Ac 4\n\nYou can't buy barding upgrades. Horses cannot use barding they are not trained in. \n\nThis system only supports one stable area. If you want to have multiple stables in your mod you will need to create 7 new tokens and modify 14 conversation scripts for each instance unless you want the stabled mounts to be persistent between different stables.\n\nTHIS SYSTEM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH STANDARD BIOWARE HORSE BLUEPRINTS.\n\nWhen placing horses for use in your mod use the custom blueprints in this package instead of the standard Bioware ones. \n\nThe custom blueprints already have all the necessary variables on them for the house rules explained above. \n\nIf you intend to import this system into an existing mod you will need to replace all your instances of standard Bioware horses with these custom ones (or at least all the ones that you intend for the players to be able to use with the stable system). \n\nVersion 1 \nurks_169stable.erf\nV1 does not have the placeable horse blueprints included. My bad. I just forgot. If you are using version 1 and you want to add placeable horses to your mod just download and import \"Urk's Placeable Horses\" (urks_placehorses.erf).\n\nThe blueprints called \"Horse\" and \"War Horse\" are not intended for use as in-game placeables.

I'm mostly releasing it simply to justifying the time I've spent on them. I hope someone out there can find use for them in their module(s) or PW perhaps. Included are the following:\n\nThe Village of Meadshire - A small (strongheart) halfling settlement. Includes an inn and tavern, barracks and jail, town hall, traders' markets, schoolhouse, shrine area, mill, and caravans. Tried to keep hin-size in mind and, all in all, its a rather cozy little town I'd say.\n\nTemple of Lathander - Just as it says, a rather serene temple. Includes a large outside area, a detailed main hall, a priest's chamber, and a reliquary chamber with a secret door to an inner sanctum which houses an inquisitorial court, a healing area, the guard's barracks, a storehouse, and a dungeon.\n\nCity of Stonewall - A rather large human city divided into 6 sections being a: Merchants' Quarter, Commoners' Quarter, Nobles' Quarter, Civil Quarter, Clerical Quarter, and Royal Quarter. In the Merchant Quarter is a blacksmithy, bowywery, tailor, and magic shop. In the Commoners' Quarter an inn and tavern, a thieves guild, a junkshop, and a workhouse. In the Nobles' Quarter a library, bank reserve, bathhouse, and gentleman's club. In the Royal Quarter the castle which houses the royal hall, a royal library, the royal guard's quarters, a dungeon and storerooms, and the king's royal quarter. In the Clerical Quarter there is a large park, a smaller chapel, an academy, and a larger temple. Finally, in the Civil Quarter is the fighters' guild, the mages guild, a courthouse, and the regular guard barracks.\n\nCampaign World - As the name implies, this was intended to be for a full campaign setting I was going to try until I realized it wouldn't work in NWN. Still, there's a pretty neat elven tree village, along with a dwarven fortress, a goblin steppe settlement, and a troll sea cave complex. Probably the least complete of all of them.\n\nLastly, a lot of them have some different kind of creatures I've designed, particularly \"Village of Meadshire\" and \"Campaign World\", so take a look around the creature menu as well. Anyway, gain, it'd be great to see them end up somwhere, the first three are rather complete and detailed and ready to go, and if you do use them it'd be nice to let me know about it. :) ","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"1076":{"Title":"k'lyn draco's home","Author":"eldron draco","Submitted":20081107,"Updated":20081108,"Category":"Areas","Type":"erf","Description":"this is just a simple 8x8 area created with the base elements from 1.69.\n\nit is a home module for a character I have on Avermere.\n\nif you like, feel free to use in your mod...I would also appreciate some kudos from the community if you like it.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1077":{"Title":"Ithintal Fortress","Author":"Eldron Draco","Submitted":20081110,"Updated":20081110,"Category":"Areas","Type":"Blank-Base","Description":"This erf is a simple design with only 1.69 elements.

Thermopylae (\"hot gateway\") is a location in Greece where a narrow coastal passage existed in antiquity. It derives its name from several natural hot water springs. The Battle of Thermopylae, as recorded by the ancient historian Herodotus, was fought in August 480 BC, between an alliance of Greek city-states and the invading Persian Empire of Xerxes I, at the pass of Thermopylae in central Greece. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held up the Persian advance for seven days in total (including three days of battle), before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. Now you too can stage your own epic battles there!\n\nAbout the Prefab:\nThermopylae is a large 21x32 map fully detailing the entire Theromopylae pass from the east gate all the way to the Persian encampment in the west. I have worked from actual maps of the area as it looked in ancient times, to capture the exact feeling of this region as it actually was. The Spartan encampment is on both sides of the Phocian wall as recorded historically, while the fleet of Persian warships is anchored north of the Persian encampment. Even the path which wound its' way through the mountains behind Spartan lines is detailed so you can recreate the final surprise attack that brought an end to the Spartans' defence of Thermopylae, through the treachery of Ephialtes.\n\nContains a demo module, an .erf file, a readme file, and the Bioware Water Fix Patch Hak Pak that makes certain official Bioware tilesets run a lot smoother. (To use the patch, place it top-most priority in your own module's custom content list. It uses no .2da files, so it is totally compatible with the CEP and should work with all other types of custom content packs.)","Rating":9.7,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"1092":{"Title":"Starter Module with ready conversations","Author":"kookoo","Submitted":20080330,"Updated":20090127,"Category":"Areas","Type":"Starter module","Description":"\"STARTER MODULE W/CONVERSATIONS\"\n\nThis is a module with some basic conversations and scripts added. There is also a merchant guild area with low level specialized merchants. This module is NOT a playable module, but really a tool for builders that want some of the basics taken care of already.\n\nConversations will be templates more or less. There is a basic commoner conversation, merchant conversations, guard conversations and miscellaneous that can make things a little easier.\n\nThe biggest help will be the conversation templates. These will be basic stripped down conversations that already have scripts attached to them, such as a henchperson conversation that will allow leveling up, tactic adjustments, a generic conversation thread to join the player and that sort of thing.\n\nYou will also find templates for NPCs to check the player's class, race, alignment, gender and that sort of thing. Just copy the necessary threads into the conversation that you wish to create and write what you wish the NPC to say.\n\nThere are also various scripts available for use. Whenever possible I try to use the scripts already in the toolset to accomplish what is needed, however that is not always possible. There are other scripts that will perform various functions that the user may or may not find useful.\n\nSpecialized merchants have also been created for things like dyes and potions and other things. I added a generic merchant's guild with merchants that the builder can use or remove as needed. This will be very useful to beginning module makers. \n \nThere are three henchpersons with conversations that work, you'll have to change the dialogue a little to make them your own.\n\nI referred to Valine's ADWR series quite a few times when making my first module. I used much of that knowledge in the scripting and conversation set up in this module as well. I also grabbed the spell list that the henchpersons can cast from Fester Pot's Almraiven, although he told me that they are from Witches Wake and were made by Rob Bartel of Bioware. In the 8-15-8 update, I made a lot of improvements to the henchperson scripts with massive help from Mistress.\n\nI have learned a lot about scripting and the toolset from people on the forums, such as Mistress, Fester Pot, nereng, Axe Murderer and various others as well as using Lilac Soul's Script Generator and the NWN Lexicon. Much of the scripts I have adjusted to make simpler or work for me.\n\nI am a fair scripter, but I am sure that many of the better scripters out there will be able to make some of this better or more efficient. EDIT****** I have learned more about multiplayer scripting and this will now work with multiplayer modules and PWs. It is not geared toward them, but it won't break them now. With the exception of the 1.68 version. I have not done anything to fix that and many of the scripts are unfriendly to multiplayer. I am not really working on that version anymore and will be removing it soon.\n\nThis module includes:\nOver 50 basic conversations and conversation templates that can be copied from as needed. It includes a basic henchperson conversation with scripts already placed where needed, NPC conversations, shopkeeper conversations, guard conversations, and conversation templates where you can go in and copy threads that already have scripts attached to check the player for things like gender, class, race, skills and other things.\n\nMetal, stone and wooden doors that are locked and/or trapped with experience points given for unlocking/disabling.\n\n10 pre-made henchpersons that can be adjusted as you please.\n\nOne area, a merchant's guild with 9 ready made merchants.\n\nOver 100 scripts, many of which you will find useful and some that you may never use. \n\nI hope this helps beginning module makers or any module makers. Please note that this was made with the help of the Neverwinter Nights community without which this module and many others could never have been created.\n\nIf anyone finds anything wrong, or would like something added, just ask and I will do what I can. If you scripters out there see a way that something could be different, please feel free to straighten me out ;)\n\nUpdate 1-27-9 \n\n1.

Also, few of them have any conversation at all, and those that do are because I needed to include a script in the first line that keeps them from standing up when they talk. The module uses five simple scripts that control sitting and not getting up in a few places. You can always remove them if you don't want anyone sitting, but otherwise you shouldn't have to do anything with them. All of the containers are set to static, so if you want any of them to be useable, you'll have to set that yourself.

On the other hand, it may well prove very usefull, perhaps even to a lot of people.\nSo what is it exactly? Basically, it's a collection of ERFs that add different elemnts of the CEP ERF to your module. You can choose creatures, items, placeables, scripts or items; eac of these has it's own ERF.\n\nBUT WHY?\n\nI found that when I imported the original ERF, my module became far bigger and saved very slowly. Most of the content was stuff I didn't even want. I reakised that most of the lag and weight was causedd bny creatures, and thought, \"Why isn't there an ERF that only adds placeables?\". Well, this is the result.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nUsing 7-Zip, extract the \"erf\" folder in the archive to your NWN directory -- usually C:\\NWN. It might ask you if you'd like to merge directories; say yes. And you're done!\n\nUSAGE\n\nIn the toolset, go into File->Import. Your ERF folder should open. Navigate to the folder called \"The Modular CEP\", and choose which parts you want to use. Click \"Open\" when you're ready. I reccomend you always import the scripts. If you're going to use the creatures, you'd better use the items too.\n\nFINAL WORDS\n\nI didn't create any of the content, it's all from the CEP. If you use it, you really ought to comment and vote. That's my only rule. If some CEP guys come here and don't like it, please don't take it down.

One at a time of course. Mainly I made this as an expedient method for players to have access to multiple damage types using just a single weapon. When fighting the frost giants your sword of cold won't do much good, and carrying around a half-dozen weapons or so always seemed unrealistic to me. \n\nThese weapons, in part, address those issues. I consider them semi intelligent, moderate artifacts, as you can change the damage type to suit the situation. I made them only for the standard fighting classes and only one each, but you can make more if you wish by using the provided template scripts. Just insert whatever class you want in place of the existing one, and change the name of the script. All the weapons access the same conversation file to set the damage type local int and use individual tag based scripts. To make additional weapons for the same class just change the name and the resref of the weapon, but leave the tag the same. You may want to make 3 or 4 weapons for the fighter class for instance, fewer additional weapons for the other classes.\n\nSimply activate the item and start the conversation. Then the next time you equip the weapon the requested damage type will occur. Length of damage effect and amount of damage is based on the levels the player has in the particular class of weapon they are using. The weapon is activatable 2/day. Much more than that would defeat the purpose of the limited duration of the effect, which is quite long.\n\nCheers! ffbj\n\nIncluded is Knat's combat dummy so you have something to bash a bit, as you test out the weapons.\n\nPlaytester: Blasco Yang\n\nUpdated to delete the current local int on the weapon if you reactivate the weapon before the original expires.

The trigger is available on your custom trigger palette in the Special Custom 1 category after installation. Paint them down to prevent creatures from being able to use spells while standing inside the trigger zone. This includes the use of potions, items, etc. Anything that gets spell hooked will be blocked. It does not block item properties like enhancements to attack or damage or bonus feats and stuff like that, they will remain active -- its only the spells that get blocked.\nEach trigger can be separately configured, via a variable set on the trigger, to affect both PCs and NPCs, or just PCs only. By default only PCs are affected. Note \"NPCs\" includes a PC's associates (hench, summon, companion, familiar, follower, etc).\nNote also that \"spell blockage\" does not mean the caster is prevented from casting the spell, using the item, drinking the potion, etc. Rather, it means that the magic always fails to fire off. No projectile. No impact. No effects or damage. The caster will still go thru the casting or drinking or reading etc motions, and will lose one of his per/day uses or item charges or the potion or scroll, it will just be wasted and inneffective.\n\nThe triggers are compatible with all modules that do not use a spellhooking script, as well as with all modules that do use one -- except those that dynamically change the spellhook script variable X2_S_UD_SPELLSCRIPT on the fly during play. If you do that you'll have to tweak my scripts. Basically if you do the standard common recommended spellhook setup procedure, added in the toolset module variables or in code from OnModuleLoad, then you're safe.\n\nTesting of this package was minimal, but it seemed to worked ok in single player mode.\n\nThese triggers are meant to be paint-and-play. You shouldn't need to do anything to them property wise after painting them down except maybe to change that \"PC_Only\" variable if you want it to affect NPCs too.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\nKAMZ v1.0 requires the original game only (no expansion paks SOU, HOTU, although it should work fine with any combination of them), however you must be updated to v1.69 or later. KAMZ is completely independent of all hak paks that do not employ dynamically designating a spellhook script, which is probably 99.99999% of haks you can find if not all of them. Therefore it is seamlessly compatible with virtually every hak pak combination possible.\n","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":["Community Contribution Award 2007"]},"1158":{"Title":"Standalone PRC Spells v. 1.0","Author":"Slasher, Gerder, ShaDoOoW","Submitted":20100527,"Updated":20100527,"Category":"Other","Type":"Spells","Forums":"Link","Description":"Instalation:\n\n1) Add content of spells.2da to your spells.2da, save and reopen in some great 2da editor which rename the lines.\n2) Import erf into your module\n3) Add PRC tlk (included in this release, but dunno version) into your module.

Well, to celebrate the upcoming Evil Dead remake movie, I\nhave built an Evil Dead Cabin prefab based on the design of it from the\noriginal movies. Details from Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 have been added to\ncreate the perfect atmosphere for your adventures against Kandarian demons,\nzombies, and anything else you want to have inhabit the place. Just add\nboomstick (using your favorite firearms hak pak), Ash, and monsters... and\nyou'll be ready to rock and roll! I think there are even some chainsaw hak\npaks out there if you really want to re-create Evil Dead in a way that will\nmake players say: \"Groovy\". At least now, you have the right cabin for it!\n\nNote: Both the cabin and its' cellar have been faithfully re-created, with\nworking trap door and everything you've seen in the movies. I worked from\nmaps I found online, while also re-watching the films as I built this. I\nwas able to re-create such items as modern-looking lamps, lights, and even\nthe projector in the cellar using absolutely no modern hak paks whatosever\nand only CEP for hak paks at all! So, this was quite the monumental effort\nwith a lot of creative placeable work invovled. It was worth it, however,\nsince it looks incredible in-game and will greatly please fans of Evil Dead!\n\n\nComes with a demo module and .erf file for easy importing into your world.\n\nAs a bonus, I am including .jpg files of the maps I worked from so you can\nsee the basic plan of the cabin and how closely I was able to re-create it.","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"1236":{"Title":"Orc Fort","Author":"Chaos_Theocrat","Submitted":20130303,"Updated":20130303,"Category":"Areas","Type":".rar File","Description":"Requirements: Nwnv1.69, SoU, and HoTU plus CEPv2.4a\nNote: This prefab makes use of the cep2_add_skies hak pak.\n\nOn a small, rugged peninsula there sits a mighty Orcish fort where the army\nof the local Orc kings gather to plot the conquest of neighboring lands.
