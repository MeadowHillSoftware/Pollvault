As this is my favourite soundset from any game, I thought it might be a good idea to make it available for Neverwinter Nights characters. It would be suitable for a good or neutral character to whom faith is not unimportant, and who keeps a cool and reasoned head most of the time. The soundset has been tested in both games and shows up as \"Harper Scout\" in character creation.\n\nI have come across other Grace conversions, but I wasn't completely happy about using them, because they included PS:T specific references (e.g. \"The brothel was a learning experience...\") that wouldn't fit in with my NWN characters. This soundset is reasonably devoid of Sensate references, and as a result is quite versatile. \n\nThere is a separate download for NWN1 and NWN2, because soundsets work slightly differently between the games. In NWN1 you need a custom talk table to make the soundset work for PCs (this way, it displays the character's utterances in text over the PC's head), but in NWN2 you don't (however, the soundset.2da for NWN2 is significantly expanded). So, if you want this soundset for NWN1, download GraceNWN1.7z - and, if you want it for NWN2, download GraceNWN2.7z. If you want it for both games, download both (it's just easier). Or, if you want it for both games and are on slow dialup, you can download GraceCombo.7z and convert the NWN1 version to usability NWN2 by following my instructions in a text file.\n\nThe NWN1 version contains a small demo module, which is associated with the hakpak and the custom talk table. The demo module was made with toolset version HotU 1.69 Beta 2. The NWN2 version does not have a demo module, because I don't think it's really necessary (custom voicesets are much easier to add to NWN2).\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I'm putting this up in 7Z only, but you don't need 7Zip to decrypt 7Z files. WinRAR opens them as well, and most people who download things from the Vault will have WinRAR. If anyone who doesn't have WinRAR desperately wants a plain ZIP version, just ask. But, honestly, for the sake of a small download for WinRAR, you'll save yourself a lot of time later being able to download better compressed files in RAR and 7Z format.","Rating":9.66,"Votes":10,"Awards":[]},"669":{"Title":"Zaliczenie","Author":"Doc","Submitted":20080215,"Updated":20080215,"Category":"Music - Eerie","Format":"MP3","Description":"Its just some polish swedish music I find kinda nice.

The set includes Fall-from-Grace, Drow Matron, MoW companions plus additional voices from BG, PST and others. See credits for details. In addition, I included Non-Prophetï¿½s modifications to unlock some companion and NPC voices to be used by PCs. \n- NWN OC: Boddyknock, Daelan, Grimgnaw, Linu, Sharwyn, Tomi.\n- SoU: Deekin, Dorna, Female Elf Noble, Katriana, Male Blackguard, Male Desert Warrior, Mischa Waymeet, Xanos.\n- HotU: Aribeth (Paladin and Blackguard), Daelan, Deekin, Linu, Nathyrra, Sharwyn, Tomi, Valen.\n- NWN2 OC: Ammon Jerro, Bishop, Casavir, Elanee, Grobnar, Khelgar, Qara, Sand, Shandra, Zhjaeve.\n- MotB: Gann, Kaelyn, Okku, Safiya, Araman, Kaji.\n- SoZ: Belueth, Chir, Finch, Grykk, Inshula, Lastri, Quarrel, Ribsmasher, Septimund, Soraevora, Umoja.\n- MoW: Charissa, Mantides, Rinara.\n\n\nUpdate 08-10\n\n- Added Hak-version for NWN1\n- Updated the soundset.2da files to include 14 more voicesets\n- Changed SerenityFrostï¿½s Jon Irenicus soundset so it is not mute anymore\n\n\nInstructions:\n- Download SerenityFrost's and Gilrad's voicesets (see below for the links)\n- Download the JonIrenicus.rar file from here.\n- If you already have the 33 previous voicesets installed, there is no need to re-download the voicesets.rar file from here, it is not changed! If you have a new installation, download this one as well. If you only want the 33 voicesets, you don't need to download JonIrenicus.rar, SerenityFrost's and Gilrad's voicesets.\n- Extract all sound files and the .ssf files into the Voicesets folder in your override folder (i.e. C:\\Documents and Settings\\[User Name]\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override). For the sake of organization, I put the files into various folders wrapped in the Voicesets folder. Create it if it doesn't exist. Further subfolders are tolerated.\n- Do *not* add any soundset.2da file possibly included in any of these downloads!\n- Download the separate Voicesets_2DA.rar file from here. Depending on your NWN2 installation, drop the correct soundset.2da file into the Voicesets folder in your override folder, replacing any possibly present existing soundset.2da file in your override folder. There are .da files for 33 voicesets of for 47.\n- You may want the separate readme file as well. It contains additional information on the voices.\n\nThe voicesets are now available during character creation. In multiplayer games, these voicesets will not be heard by other players unless they have them also installed in their own override directories. \nRemove any other soundset.2da file from your override directory, or these voicesets will not work properly! Because there is only one voiceset.2da file loaded by the game engine, this voiceset is not directly compatible with any other voiceset. If you have already another voiceset installed you wish to keep, you will have to customize the soundset.2da file. All changes I made to the soundset.2da are documented in the readme.\nYou can reorganize the files and folders at your will, as long as they remain within the override folder.\nI could not test the soundset.2da file for MotB, use it at your own peril!\nIf something isnï¿½t working, make sure you have exactly one, and only one, soundset.2da file in your override folder!\n\nAll 12 Voicesets by SerenityFrost. Download the voicesets from the links below. IMPORTANT: you do *not* need any of the .2da files from there. Use *only* the ones included here from this voiceset here if you want to use all voicesets simultaneously! (If I sound repetitive: this canï¿½t be stressed enough.)\n\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\nLink\n\n2 Voicesets by Gilrad, w8chaotic.rar and w8eccf1.rar. Download from Link \n\n\nHak-version for NWN1\n\nThis hak includes all voices mentioned here (including SerenityFrostï¿½s and Gilradï¿½s) *plus* the requested Neeshka-Voiceset from NWN2! \n\nHow to use: \nDrop the VoiceSets_BlueS.hak file into the hak-folder. \nLink the hak-file to your module. \nCreate a matching soundset.2da file (see separately available readme for everything I changed in the NWN2 soundset.2da file, so you can match the files). Drop it either in the override folder or pack into a hak file and link it as well to your module. The voices should be available at character creation. If the hak-file is not linked to the module, the PC will remain silent.\nI did not include a soundset.2da file into the VoiceSets_BlueS.hak because I only have an outdated installation of NWN1 which I havenï¿½t used for years. (In a quick and dirty test with the NWN2 soundset.2da file in the override folder, it worked, but really, donï¿½t use this to play!) \nTo create your own soundset.2da file is fairly simple, in principle. Merge the appropriate lines from the NWN2-soundset.2da file with your current one from NWN1 in a simple texteditor like notepad. Further help can be found in the readme, or look at e.g. SerenityFrostï¿½s guide Link \n\nThe small print: \nI made this compilation for my own use, and Iï¿½m sharing it so other people can enjoy it as well. That said, these files are offered as-is without any liability. \nI changed the original soundset.2da files and tweaked some .ssf files. The MoW companion sounds were extracted from the original .hak file so they work from the override directory. The other voicesets used were made as stated in the credits. \n\nCredits: \nEstelindisï¿½ Fall-from-Grace Soundset: Link\nMoW Companion Soundset: Link\nNon-Prophetï¿½s Full Voiceset: Link\nSander Phillipseï¿½s Soundset (partially redundant with Toroï¿½s): Link\nToroï¿½s Custom Voiceset (partially redundant with Sanderï¿½s): Link\nTygr10ï¿½s Drow Matron Voiceset: Link\nSerenityFrostï¿½s Voicesets: Link\nGilradï¿½s Voicesets: Link\nJon Irenicus soundset originally uploaded by SerenityFrost.

I have also provided nwn2 sound blueprints for each sound. This is roughly 10x the number of sounds nwn2 includes via the toolset. This pack is complete with blueprints organized into categories based on default nwn2 sound organization. Sounds from freesound.org are licensed under one of four Creative Commons licenses, see the credits for specifics. The filenames had to be shortened for nwn2, so the initial number matches the number of the file on freesound.org (the numbers are unique).\n\nSounds have been grouped into 4 groups of approximately equal number of files. You probably want to download all four groups, and select the sounds that work for your module or campaign, removing the rest. The sounds should be copied to your module or campaign folder. The blueprints go in the same location, and will appear in the toolset under the freesound.org category.\n\nBlueprint categories, all are under the Freesound.org category:\nBackground and Ambient: similar to the default Background category, plus sounds that make for good area wide ambient sound\nCave: sounds most likely to be found in caves, things like rubble.\nChatter: Same as default, sound for groups of people, crowds etc\nCity & Town: same as default, most useful for placing in cities/towns, generally the sound of work being done\nCreatures: same as default, creatures, animals, birds, vermin\nDungeon or Creepy Sound: sounds most likely to be used for dungeons or creepy effects.\nEnvironmental: same as default, sounds of water, fire etc.\nHuman Vocalization: individuals speaking, coughing, etc.\nInstruments and music: both single notes being played, and melodies\nModern Day House: sounds from real life, lawnmowers, microwaves and such\nSci-Fi sounding SFX: hopefully self explanatory\nShort SFX like clicks or beeps: brief sounds for use as button presses or the like.\n\nI categorized the sounds by listening to them, so things are likely not perfectly categorized.\n\nNot sure if these will work in NWN1, as I do not build for that game.\n\nIf someone was going to make a \"curated\" pack, as had been suggested, the prime places to look for extraneous sounds would be the Sci-Fi, Modern Day House (both these categories could be removed with little effect for most builders), Creature sounds (there are tons of bird sounds), Environmental water (lots of water sounds), Instruments (lots of single note sounds) and the Background and Chatter categories (these two categories have many of the larger files).\n\nCredit to Tchos for working out how to batch convert sounds for use in nwn2.
