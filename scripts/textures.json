I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\n\nv2 I use Helvene's tree override but this still looks good without it.\n\nNovember 12th, 2012\n--------------------\nShadow issues fixed thanks to OMB's CM3.\n\nAll textures that overwrite an existing Bioware resource have remained in TGA format.\nIf you intend to integrate this into a hak, I recommend converting all the tga's into dds,I use this:\nLink\nI used a couple of tiles from Helvene's tree override as a base where pplicable.\nUsed a tree stump and dead tree from NWN2 extracted from CEP.\nAlso thanks to Arbedaios for a fix to grass02 texture.\nDue to the way Bio trees were mapped, expect some variances in appearance.\nThere have been no changes to woks but I've decided to include them because I ran them through CM3 and it fixed many errors.\n\nFebruary 12 ,2013\n-----------------\nThis is my biggest update yet and there are bound to a few bugs, just let me know and I'll see to them.\n\nCredit where credit is due:\n---------------------------\nZwerkules graciously donated \"no seethrough\"/retextured houses. This is an update in and of itself folks!\nBig thanks to _Six for letting me use the cloak tower and evil temple from his CC city exterior.\nI'd also like to thank the PW \"The Vast\" for putting up with my testing. \n\nI have taken very little artistic leeway and 99.9% kept true to the original tile. Any changes/if any/ are purely cosmetic and unobtrusive. Some woks have been redone completely. This was greatly aided and made easy using maxscript called TimScripts conform wrap. Thanks to OldTimeRadio for showing me this.For more info on this:\nLink\n\nAlso made use of a maxscript by Ryan Smith called TreeGen, self explanatory I think. for more info on this:\nLink\n\n\nCorrected an issue with doors being slightly off in Neutral temple 2x2 and cloaktower 2x2. You might have to repaint the door for fix.\n\nModels have been compiled using MDL-Compiler Bioware.\n\n\nNothing could be done about the no shadows below 0 z axis so forgive that inconsistency. The only alternative is to raise the whole tileset but then it would not work as an override.\n\nI decided to release as override and hak. However I strongly recommend the hak version as the dds are superior to the tga's. I personally use the patch/hak method. For more info on this, see:\nLink\n\n\nBelow is a readme file detailing all the changes to .set file.\n\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\nWorks with standard NWN. If the PW or module contains a modified ttr01.set, your mileage may vary.This is because those resources in a hak have priority\nover the override folder. I have noted in the readme all the modifications to the set file for easier custom integration.\n\nModification\n------------\nTo modify the grass height or density is simple. Open the ttr01.set file with notepad, 2nd paragraph down you'll see this\n\nsection:\n\n[GRASS]\nGrass=1\nGrassTextureName=toro_drygrass02\nDensity=6.500\nHeight=0.750\nAmbientRed=0.600\nAmbientGreen=0.600\nAmbientBlue=0.500\nDiffuseRed=0.600\nDiffuseGreen=0.400\nDiffuseBlue=0.300\n\nChange the height and density to your hearts desire.\nOptionally you could just delete the line that says:\nGrassTextureName=toro_drygrass02\nThis will result in a combo, my dead grass on the ground with Bioware 3D grass.\n","Rating":10,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"115":{"Title":"Scrolls Colored According to Spell Level","Author":"Legends of Talan'ith, Nobody-special (uploaded by Micteu)","Submitted":20081121,"Updated":20090707,"Category":"Other","Format":"Targa","Forums":"Link","Description":"This override contains the .tga files associated with all spells useable by wizards, colored according to spell level for the wizard class (Example: Continual Flame is a Cleric 3/Wizard 2 spell, so it would be colored as level 2.).\n\nThis makes hunting for spell scrolls a lot easier, both since the spells wizards cannot cast will still be standard brown, and they can be arranged by level with a glance.\n\nThe files were made for the Legends of Talan�ith server by Nobody-special.
