The undead hordes known as the Blackbone Empire have risen from nearly a decade of dormancy and with them they bring new leaders - 4 ruthless generals and a cocky overlord with an ancient sword that can corrupt and conquer all those it touches! In the center of the mainland stands the great Ebonstone Castle, a fortress the size of a city. From the castle stretches out a long, narrow, ebony road that marks where the undying armies have claimed their lands. Standing high and tall, penetrating the roofs of the castle and the boundaries of the sky are the great Columns of Infernalus, each one linked to an element of the world and each one claimed by a specified lord of the Blackbone Empire. Nearing their entire domination of the mainland, the Blackbone Empire attack Castle Everhope, ruled by Gahn Bloodbane. After a near slaughter, the Humans finally fall and Gahn is confronted by Arcanoix 'personally'! After exchanging words with the dark prince, Gahn is struck by the Omniblade and killed. As the castle crumbles, so does the last remnants of mankinds civilization. Gahn is presumed dead......atleast for awhile....\n\nFour months later, those who valued their lives have surrendered and become slaves to Arcanoix's great empire. Every nation has fallen, cities lie in ruins, bodies litter the streets, only to rise and become peons in the great Blackbone Empire. Awakening and battling undead posession, Gahn is greeted in Hellfire by a spirit known only as the Crafter. The Crafter offers Gahn a chance at revenge, and thus, Gahn jumps at the offer without considering the cost. Once again in the Human world and in his own tomb, the only half-Demon with freewill begins his quest for vengeance and a goal to fulfill his vow to destroy Arcanoix De'Vun and the Blackbone Empire once and for all!\n\nPlayers will play the role of Gahn Bloodbane as a Custom Race, a Custom Class featuring unique feats and abilities and play through the ultimate story about vengeance, war, and heroism! Players will travel through only a fragment of Inferalus through the Charwood Forests, the Everhope Canyons - until they finally reach their goal - the Ebonstone Castle! There players will explore the different wings of the stronghold - the Shadow Forge, the Greenfire Labratories, and much more! As Gahn Bloodbane, players gain 'Demonic Traits' and can use such abilities to bypass obstacles. A perfect example is the Mist Form - using it to bypass portcullis' and grates to access blocked off areas. There are other talents that can be gained through defeating the four lieutenants of the empire - until the final confrontation with the dark prince himself - Arcanoix De'Vun! I am calling ALL module builders, scripters, photoshop champions, writers, and voice actors to the stand now and hear my words : I wish to create this module, this epic adventure! I want players to 'LIVE' the storyline through the eyes of the fallen Human hero Gahn Bloodbane! If you're interested, please email me at OwnageInc_Burton@yahoo.com or contact me on the forums under my name NetherFinch. \n\nI have a soundtrack already created, the storyline is already written, I just need testers, scripters, builders, you name it - I need it!

The areas I am most excited about right now are the ones Jack is producing for Act Two. He's really nailed the Plain of Infinite Portals, imho.\n\nParty Companions\n\n- We've settled in at 18 potential party companions.\n\nSigil Factions\n\nWe've implemented our Sigil Faction system. One of the major choices you will make in the first chapter is which faction your character joins. There are a wide variety of benefits and consequences to joining the factions. You choice of Sigil Faction affects who your enemies and allies are; how potential party companions feel about you; and each faction has different benefits for the character in terms of gear and feats.\n\nEpithet Feats\n\nWe've implemented our Epithet Feats system as well. In the screens below you can see some of the feats on the character sheet. We've put in 30 epithet feats so far, and there will probably be a few more down the line.\n\nSome of the feats simply help you define your character in the campaign; others affect your dialogue options; some provide you with benefits; and a few will bring you nothing but trouble.\n\nThere is also two or three epithet feats that I would be surprised if anyone unlocks in the first few playthroughs.\n\nThe Score\n\nGopher, Oldbrian, Ceekayed, Minomus and the fifth member of the composing team, Joel, have produced a combined 2 hours of top-notch music that really captures the Planescape vibe.\n\nCustom Content\n\nWe're clocking in at around 130 custom placeables right now, the most notable being Schazzwozzer's Gatehouse (which isn't previewed just yet) and MadHatterYU's Mortuary.\n\nI've been doing some work on two custom tilesets (othere is a screen in the gallery of one of them). Michael has been working on a mimir as well, and we're hoping to get that operational in game soon.\n\nWe're starting to plan which 4 prestige classes we are going to do, Doomlord is definitely going to be one of them.\n\nAlso, of course, credit where credit is due: We're using a few pieces of custom character content from the vault in addition to the stuff we produce. Specifically: custom character heads by Badmagic and LeadderNoir and custom outfits by Alleane, Atlantis001 and Cecil.\n\nThanks to Adinos and Tazpn for their work on custom content tools. We certainly never could have gotten as far as we have without OBJ2MDB and the 3dsMax MBD Plug-in. Also GrinningFool's toolset plug-ins are truly invaluable.\n\nVoice-Over\n\nMaglok has taken the lead on doing post work on all of our voice-over audio and he is doing an excellent job. He's come up with some very cool effects to apply to some of the more off-beat, weird, evil, etc. voices.\n\n-Monty","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"83":{"Name":"Neeska Wielding 2 Axes","Author":"Nasty Mortriac","Submitted":20070204,"Updated":20070205,"Category":"Custom Content","Type":"Action","Description":"Neeska's wielding The Sandstorm and Krorton's Skullcrusher at lvl 10 - wtf?","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"84":{"Name":"Best Screenshot Nominees","Author":"Neverwinteros","Submitted":20070206,"Updated":20070207,"Category":"Modules","Forum Thread":"Link","Short Description":"Custom screenshots","Type":"Action","Link":"Link","Description":"We made a nwn2 screenshot contest in our spanish community Neverwinteros.com .

As some of you know, I am working on a few Dragonlance modifications at the current time. Many have you have all ready downloaded the deities HAK and I've received good reviews and I understand while it's totally functional, it is still incomplete. I've also been working on two other projects, one being the High Clerist's Tower and the other which I will call the Dragonlance Character HAK. I call it this because from the moment you load the game and begin Character Creation, the whole process will be Dragonlance oriented. The screens, the characters, the races, the domains, the classes, the backgrounds, the music, the t-shirt you are wearing, and the glass of milk you will be drinking. All Dragonlance. I am posting this now because I had originally stated I would release this HAK by 31MAR07. That will now be pushed back but as I always I will keep you informed. \n\n I recently came acrossed a great oppurtunity. I wanted this HAK to include a lot of fandom and I have the oppurtunity to make some great additions to the HAK with which I think the community will be pleased. I have been in contact with Kranar Drogin, the lead developer on the fan based continent of Adlantum. You can check it out here.\n\nLink\n\n\nAt any rate, I think it's an important piece of fandom that must be added to the HAK and therefore I am delaying the release to include it. We are all very excited about it and as always I will update weekly with screen shots and information. Once we do a little brainstorming, I will try to give everyone a tentative idea about a realease date. I don't expect it to be 6 months or anything, but I can't promise you. The High Clerist's tower Project is still being worked on seperately and will not be affected by the HAK. I expect another 6 weeks on it. I will be travelling for 2 weeks and thus the delay.

If using labels most players of NWN are familiar with, we'd go with a Roleplay server as well as a Hardcore server.

There is an in-depth storyline that has been adjusted to fit certain server criteria.\n\nSTORYLINE\n\nIn the years leading up to 1000, Kaelthia was full of magic. Most of the known land is governed by the State of Lilac. And tensions between the elven kingdom of Frinalthia and the mostly human State of Lilac have been growing due to multiple instances. The State of Lilac has also been fighting a war that has gone back centuries with the Orcs of Pede Bog that has left both sides well-versed in the art of war.\nShortly before the dawn of the new century a rogue mage named Bulgiriden broke away from the main faction of mages of Lilac. This mage built a force of the greatest mages, and warriors from the city of Lilac and caused an uprising in which they took as many of the magical items that they could from the Mage School. A short war ensued that ended with Bulgiridens' forces being pushed out to the desert highlands of Morro, where along the way many of his fellow mages became the Dead Mages of Morro.\nAfter seeing the destruction caused by such an uprising, the State of Lilac banned all arcane magic, which caused an even deeper rift with the Elven Kingdom. This also caused the mages of Lilac to have their school sieged, and after a few days left the school in ruins.\nNow the forces for arcane magic plot a way to regain their power among the city and the State of Lilac has implemented martial law against all arcane. A dividing Line has been cut into the land between the Elven Kingdom and Lilac, where skirmishes take place on a regular basis. All the while the city of Lilac fights the orcs of Pede.\nIn this war-torn land, the humans have embraced the dwarves of the north which has caused an even deeper rift with the elves. Arcane magic-users are hunted by Magehunters, and arcane magic items are being hunted down and destroyed.\n\nTIPS\nIt may be difficult for wizards, and sorcerers as they are openly hunted by the State of Lilac. Orcs have their own city, in which half-orcs live also due to the long war between humans and orcs. Elves may have it difficult as built up tensions have caused many people in the main city to shun those of elven heritage.\n\nLOOKING FOR\nAt this point we are looking for anyone interested in contributing to this project. We have multiple areas being built or built, most everything in the world will be customized. At this moment we are really looking for area builders, and anyone who has a knack for writing conversations. Every NPC in game will serve one function at the least, whether it is to sell items, be part of a quest, or divulge information.\nPlease email me or write a comment if you are interested in contributing even a custom sword, most anything will help.\n\nPlease visit our forums or contact the submitter of this entry if you are interested in being a part of this project whether, DM, Developer, or Player.\n\nLink","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"182":{"Name":"Beholder Troubel","Author":"Peter the Wandere","Submitted":20080804,"Updated":20080805,"Category":"Custom Content","Short Description":"Horse attacking beholder","Type":"Action","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"I got this shoot by accident while I was testing one of my scripting mods.

If anyone's still around here by then, that is.\n\nI won't reveal too much, but the story involves three factions - the Ffolk, the Norlanders, and a group of mysterious rebels set on overcoming the throne and deposing Queen Alicia Kendrick. The player can choose to help or ally with these factions, or remain neutral - both will have its benefits. Also heavily involved are the Druids of Chauntea. Winter is approaching Moonshae far faster than it should be - is it a freak weather occurrence or is some greater power at work? Since the former would be a bit of a letdown to the story, I'll leave you to think about what could cause a shift in the very atmosphere of Faerun. \n\nFor all you evil-doers out there, the island of Mintarn will feature heavily. It is a hive of scum and villainy, to borrow a phrase, and several parts of the module will take place there.\n\nThe main story revolves around an NPC-driven plotline, with companions who will assist you on your travels, but for the most part the Moonshae Isles will be fully explorable. The module will feature an overland map, including ship travel. There will be 11 locations, spread over the islands of Alaron, Gwynneth, Norland, Snowdown, Moray and Oman where you can make port. Also featured will be ship-to-ship battles, sea monsters, gothic fortresses and labyrinths which stretch for miles.\n\nThis may sound optomistic, but with the overland and oversea map already up and running, several areas built, dozens more on the way, and my ideas all firmly down on paper in documents stretching across my entire desktop, I believe it is feasible.\n\nOh, just a side thought, is there actually anyone still on the vault that would even be interested in playing this? I will most likely go ahead and make it anyway, but support from the community is always uplifting and helpful. Also, if anyone is willing to lend a hand creating areas - the entire module will probably be 100, 150+ areas - I'd be eternally grateful for any help. \n\nThank you NWVault for reading, and farewell, until the next update :)\n\nUpdate 27/09/2011:\n\nFinished creating Caer Corwell in the grip of an unusually early winter - what can this mean for northern Alaron? And the Ffolk settlements on Norland have remained unusually quiet in the last couple of months. Is something sinister happening on the westernmost island of Moonshae?\n\nKarador, City of the Elves has been built and looks awesome, mainly thanks to the Tree Platform model, courtesy of Gribo.\n\nOverland Map ship system and encounters are all up and fully functioning. I'm currently working on a plethora of mini-dungeons and labyrinthine mines, many of which will have side-quests which supplement, or give information about, one of the main quests.\n\nI've developed and fleshed out my ideas for main quests, and I won't reveal much here, but I can tell you that the over-arching plot will involve elementals and possibly a minor deity; the gnomes of Lantan will be well-represented, and some of the campaign will take place on Lantan itself; and there are hints of the involvement of a sorcerer from Evermeet, and a tale involving ancient Netheril.\n\nA number of people have asked me about the companion system - I believe my adventure may be unique in having an overland map and NOT offering the custom party creation. Instead there will be a whole range of companions, all with their own histories and desires, with pages of dialogue. A couple of people asked about romances - at the moment, I'm not sure, but I have a couple of characters which I could work that into, so if it's something enough people are interested in I'll make sure to include that. The way the companions will function will be a hybrid of the cohort system in NWN2:SOZ and the companion system of NWN2:MOTB and NWN2:OC. Each will have unique dialogue to use in conversation and their diplomacy/intimidate/etc skills may come in handy in some situations. \n\nI think I've said too much - I'm ruining it all for you! Anyway, suffice to say the module is coming along nicely, despite an increasing workload in day-to-day life. I've as-yet been unable to find anyone willing to help with area construction, so anybody who can assist me in that field will be most welcome.\n\nUpdate: 28/09/2011\n\nFinalized the initial layouts for companions - there will be a total of twelve, several of which will be able to follow quest chains to gain levels in prestige classes such as Arcane Archer, Pale Master, and Blackguard. Ten of these companions will be optional and have to be found throughout the world. Of the two forced upon you, one will change depending on which side you cast your allegiance with (royalists vs rebels). These two will be required for several major quest chains; however you will be able to leave them at the inn (and later in the game, at your stronghold) when you are not seeking to further these quests. Some areas will only be accessible if you have one or both of these in your party.\n\nI will be uploading more screenshots shortly. Keep an eye on this page for further updates!\n\n(Apologies for the delay in posting; I initially uploaded in early september, but due to errors in the system it wasn't uploaded properly, so I'm reposting it.)\n\nUpdate: 08/10/2011\n\nUploaded some screenshots from Karador, Caer Corwell, and some minor areas which will be visitable around the world. I'll get up some screenshots of the gameplay (including oversea travel) as soon as I've sorted out some minor bugs. \n\nThe introduction is almost finished: the story begins on a dark and windless night; your ship has ground to a halt in the middle of a city of foreboding ruins, and an unnatural fog is upon the waves. What happens next...?\n\nNow in the works is the PC stronghold. I'm having difficulty deciding upon location and building style - I was originally going to have the PC take over an old and crumbling elven fortress, but if anyone has any other ideas, I'd like to hear them!\n\nUntil next time - goodbye :)","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"359":{"Name":"Screenshots: Crimmor","Author":"Kamal","Submitted":20120129,"Updated":20120131,"Category":"Modules","Type":"Other","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"People that check the Vault, but don't check the Bioware Social site for NWN2, might think not much is going on right now with NWN2.
