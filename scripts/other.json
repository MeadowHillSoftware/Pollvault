Also it works in multiplayer, and you can use one tlk per hackpack. Just double click dupdemo.exe to install demo and program, then click the shortcut on the desktop to launch the demo in NWN. Note: the demo overrides 20000+ dialog.tlk StringRefs, as a consequence some text of NWN GUI is replaced when you launch the game or toolset through it (the demo); that is 'normal'. No Bioware file is mofified, nothing is permanent, it will occur only when you launch the demo. See messages below for version specfic comments.

Since the mdl binary format isn't supported by most modeling programs, you will need to convert them from binary to ASCII which is supported by almost all modeling programs. And since it would only make sense to change a ASCII file to binary for ease of game play, it can do the recompiling as well. We decided that Torlack had done a fine job with his compiler/decompiler, that with a little help we could make it much more user friendly. That we have done. . Now with updated program Version 1.03.

One of my favorite tools is the Voice Widget, which can allow one DM to hold conversations between two or more NPCs. However, to use the Voice Widget the DM must be visible to the widget target. This means either becoming visible or possessing an NPC, and in the latter case the NPC plays the 'activate item' animation. When activated, the Null DM Widget sets the activator's appearance to that of the Null Human, which is invisible (no spells involved). Thus, the DM can 'appear' and use the Voice Widget without becoming visible to players or possessing NPCs. When activated on a nulled DM, the DM's original appearance is restored.

Time to load has been reduced, allowing faster access to the best the PRC has to offer. \n\n3.2 has been released, bringing with it a whole passel of new content, including the Dragon Adept, the Warlock, and more than 10 other prestige classes. Also in the release are more than 100 new races, piles of new feats, new spells, and heavy optimization of all of the PRC. Crafting has been expanded and improved to coincide with the release of the Warlock. Psionics and Truenaming has also been improved and upgraded.\n\nThis release brings the PRC over 150 total classes, as well as 150 races and 1000 spells. In other news, we have removed the Archer class, and replaced it with the Bowman, a class better suited to NWN. Finally, we are calling this the \"Dragon\" release, due to the 8 Dragon oriented classes in it.\n\nPRC 3.1 is here, with 7 new base classes, including Truenaming, an entirely new magical system. To go along with that, there are over 150 new spells for the Good and Evil casters among us, including the Corrupt and Exalted spells for those of extreme alignments. On top of that, there is complete, PnP Crafting, allowing mages to enhance any piece of magical armour they come across, create any weapon, or forge rings that boost their powers.\n\nThe PRC now stands at 126 classes, 60+ Epic spells, 300+ new spells, several hundred new feats, 60+ new races, Psionics, Truenaming, PnP Crafting, Spellbooks, Domains, 2 Character Creators, and a host of other goodies for players and builders alike.\n\nThe PRC Server Pack 1.7 has been updated with a plugin that removes inventory lag entirely. This is highly recommended for any PRC using PW out there.\n\nAll users should read the manual, either the online or downloadable version, before using the PRC.\n\nPRC Pack 3.3 .RAR version\nPRC Pack 3.3 .EXE version\nPRC Character Creator\n\nAny comments, concerns, or bug reports should be directed to our webpage and forums: http://www.nwn2prc.com/","Rating":9.38,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"806":{"Title":"Guide to Rhun's Underdark","Author":"Shayan et al","Submitted":20050106,"Updated":20051215,"Category":"Reference Guides","Format":"PDF","Description":"This guide is now out-dated.

Since no record is made of which files are imported, you will have to have a copy of the .erf file you imported so that the program will know which files to remove. If you have imported files to your module, but changed them subsequently, the program will ask you if you still want to remove them. After you've DeImported, you should open your module in the Toolset, go to the build menu -> Build module, and compile all scripts and palettes. You may also want to check for missing resources in case you deleted something that was used by something else. Failure to take these steps may result in your module not functioning properly. Note that, before DeImporting, it is wise to backup your module file. This is automatically done by the program, unless you turn off the option to do so, which is not recommended.\n Future versions (if there are any) of this program may do this for you, but for now, having the Toolset do the last part of the job is your only option.\n\nWhile I have tested this program quite extensively, I make no guarantees that it will work for you, nor that is entirely safe to use.

Found one or two that worked ok but they were...well let's just say they weren't greatly robust. I'm sure the custom content guru's have really nice ones but I couldn't find them so I made one myself and here it is.\n\nIt's a breeze to install and use but you must be running Windows to use it. I'm pretty sure it requires Windows XP but if you have Windows 98 or later you can give it a go and it just might be ok (no way for me to test sorry). Unzip the contents of the zip file you downloaded and double-click on either the Setup.exe or Killer_TLK_Editor_v3.0.<b></b>msi to start the installer that will guide you thru the installation process.\n\nSee the built-in help system after you install Killer TLK Editor (click the Help Topics... option on the Help Menu) for instuctions on how to use it.\n\nPlease don't use this product to mess up your dialog.tlk and/or CEP.tlk files and then come complaining to me when your game won't run. Those files should never ever be edited -- you should make copies of them under a different name and edit the copies instead.\nVersion 2.0 adds new Import/Export TLK Table merging functions. Some new filter options for the search and replace features. Tile options for the window menu to make positioning and sizing multiple open editor views easier. And a couple of performance increases so the program will run smoother and load/save TLK Tables a bit faster.\n\nVersion 3.0 adds a new TLK Table Repair feature to help you fix and load those stubborn semi-valid tables, a new Token Wizard to assist in adding the special conversation tokens recognized by the NWN game engine into your string entries, a new display mode to assist with the conversion of strref numbers for custom tlk table use, and a few bug fixes.\n\nVersion 1.0 & 2.0 users should uninstall their old version before installing version 3.0. This can be done thru the Windows Control Panel -- Add/Remove Programs icon. You are also urged to review the following help system topics which were expanded or added to cover all the new features:\n\nGeneral Overview\nEdit an Existing TLK Table\nTLK Table Repair Concepts\nUsing the Import and Export commands to merge TLK Tables\nRepair TLK Table Dialog\n\n\nSpecial Note: Version 3.0 was changed without creating a version 3.1 to add in a new Custom Color feature to the Color Block options accessed thru the wizard hat button. It was such a small change I didn't deem it necessary to make a whole new version and have to update all the help files and references to the version number everywhere in the program. If you have the v3.0 without this feature, uninstall it from Windows Control Panel-Add/Remove Programs icon, then download and install v3.0 again to get this new feature.\n","Rating":9.96,"Votes":41,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"1006":{"Title":"dm_setrace index of codes","Author":"Cte","Submitted":20051113,"Updated":20051113,"Category":"DM-Related","Format":"Txt File","Description":"This file is a description of codes used in command dm_setrace #\nIt is only the part of it.

So one day I came up with an idea to port the system so people can convert the languages online so they can quickly and easily just copy and paste the translated text anywheres they want.\n\nNote: This is only a one way converter. Its near impossible to translate the languages back to common. Some languages remove letters, use the save output for several letters (Like animal uses ') and so on.\n\nDMFI Languages Included:\nAbyssmal\nAnimal\nCelestial\nDraconic\nDrow\nDwarf\nElven\nGnome\nGoblin\nHalfling\nInfernal\nLeetspeak\nOrc\nThieve's Cant\n\nCustom Languages:\nArcanum\nReptilian\nFey\n\nAlso theres support for the new DMFI 1.0.8 custom languages system as well. This system lets you quickly create a new language by setting the language index past 100 on the language widget. This will then proccess the language using a cipher and randomization based on the index given.\n\nTo convert to a custom language, select Custom from the language list and then enter the index of the custom language.\nNote:\nIf the index is 101, then the language index is actually 1.

This does the opposite of makedepend, ie. \"I know what files I've changed, but which scripts do I now need to recompile and redistribute?\"\nYou'd be looking at something like:\nBash: for n in `nssdepend.pl changedfile.nss otherchange.nss`; do nwnsscomp -c $n; done\nCMD: for /F %n in ('perl nssdepend.pl changedfile.nss otherchange.nss') do nwnsscomp -c %n\nWant to know what files to include in module if you were to modify nw_i0_generic?\nnssdepend.pl nw_i0_generic.nss\n...forget it.\nI guess now y'all want a script that can be executed from desktop and given the name of the modified script(s), without .nss extension, and will automatically rebuild everything.

They are what I generally deem \"essentials\" though your use (and mine, for that matter) may vary greatly. Nonetheless, I felt there was value in all of this information in one place (along with information not generally available to the community at large either because I put it together, or got it elsewhere.)\n\nIncluded is the\nSpellchecker 1.5 by Hans Olsen\n-This utility can san your module for spelling errors. See included documentation for details.\n\nChrist Taylor's Design Document Template\n-This Word document is a very large (and amusing) design document template. Design docs are a must for big projects, especially colaberative ones. Obviously, it may be excessive for smaller solo works but much in here is still valuable.\n\nDesign Tools Excel File\n-The Design Proposal is the work of Rob Bartel, the rest is mine Essentially included in this is a \"overview' design doc (suitable for solo works), as well as documents I've created to keep track of module aspects such as area lighting, area details, and audio. I find this one very useful.\n\nStarting Conditional Scripts\nCompiled by ruelk\n-This is a list of all the existent scripts that check for common starting conditionals for conversations. Handy to have around.\n\n\nModule Design and Builder's Toolkit\nby Thirdpres\nThis is an enormous pdf file with a lot of great compiled information regarding story, design, etc. Thirdpres originally posted this on the forums but I edited it all together in one document. Amazing work, truly.\n\nNWN Master Dialog Tree Excel File\n-Essentially this is an excel dialog tool. Good for working when you don't have the toolset handy, has some macros that seem to occasionally cause trouble however. Unfortunately, I cannot play tech support for it.\n\nNWN Scripting Guide v1.0\nA compilation of all sorts of scripting information I compiled and exists independently on the vault. Georg Zoeller made a note, however, stating that the following is now true:\n\" The part about script caching is obsolete in 1.65 now, the server is pretty much caching everything frequently used on it's own now, at least if you have more than 64 megs of memory\n\n- Using Get2DAString in loops does not have bad performance implications in 1.65+ as the server will pretty much keep any 2da in memory, unless you really screwed up all your INI settings. As a result you lose the ability to change 2das at runtime as they will likely stay cached forever until reboot\"\n\nToolset Manual by the Builder's Project\nComprehensive manual for the toolset. Too bad this didn't ship with the game.\n\n\nSkill/Ability Check Guide\nThis is from Rob Bartel's Witch's Wake. It is a template conversation file with skill/ability checks.\n\n\n\n--\nSo, unless expressly said - this work is not mine. Just compiled for handy use.

If you are not hosting a module then you do not need the modified nwserver file so ignore it. Any module you see listed with the words 'uber regen' in either the server name area and/or description area are real uber modules with real uber regen that require you to use the modified nwmain file to start the game if you wish to enter. If you wish to host a module that has real uber regen then you must use the modified nwserver file in order to \"up\" the module to game spy and please make sure that server name and/or description say 'uber regen' so people will know. MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP THE ORIGINAL NWMAIN AND NWSERVER FILES which are located in the nwn folder. After you back up the orginal files place these two modified files into the nwn folder and let them overwrite what is there. Once you added these modified files into your nwn folder you can now, as I said, \"up\" modules with real uber regen (please make sure server and/or desctiption says 'uber regen' in it) and you can go to modules using real uber regen. If you use these files and you wish to go to any module that that does not use these files then simply replace the modified nwmain with the original you backed up and then use the original nwmain to start the game instead. In other words, just swap the nwmain files back and forth between the original file and the modified file...using the original to go to normal servers and the modified to enter mods with real uber regen.

From jaw-dropping disappointments to heart-stopping grand unveilings, this is where the video game world lays it out every year. The noise, the parties, the hype and the hip meet in one big, chaotic mingling of technobabble and gamespeak. ALFA would like to thank Feargus Urquhart, CEO of Obsidian, and Anthony Davis, developer on the NWN2 project, for taking time out of their crazy E3 schedules to answer some of our questions. We hope the NWN community finds answers of interest to the questions posed by our man at E3, Kevin Faust, in the MP3s linked below this story.\n\nIn the interviews, Kevin pushes a lot of hot-button issues, including memory requirements in NWN2 and DM client release schedule. On the latter, Anthony Davis has this to say: \"The DM client is currently undergoing a heavy review and a heavy rewrite and we're taking a lot of input from the community on how they want to use it and what's the best way for them to use it and the features they would like to see in it.\" Reassuring news, and much appreciated to know that they're reading the many, many posts about the DM client and other critical areas of interest for persistent worlds and the whole community. As for the memory requirements, Feargus dropped a hint of exploring memory saving means, interesting to a PW of multiple servers running multi-hundred area modules. \"We are looking into a way to possibly shut areas within a module off,\" he said. \"In essence turn the mod on and off dynamically, depending on where characters are going to be�to save memory and save CPU.\" He couldn't guarantee it, but nonetheless it can be seen as an encouraging indication that PWs or large modules anywhere haven't fallen off the radar.\n\nFor the rest of the interviews, I'll just let you listen by clicking on the links below, and leave you with the encouraging words of Anthony Davis when asked about how complete he would consider the game itself at this stage. \"It is due for a September release and I think we're waaay on track.\" Here's to being 'way on track.'","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1098":{"Title":"Hugar's PVP Tournament Guide","Author":"Roald_Doll123@lycos.com","Submitted":20060520,"Updated":20060520,"Category":"DM-Related","Format":"PDF","Forums":"Hugar's PVP Tournament","Description":"These are custom PVP tournament charts/rules/instructions.

I came up with a fix that worked on my system, and thought I'd share. Will it work on yours? Don't know. Is it worth a try? That's up to you.\n\nWhat to do: Download one of the files. (See below for the differences between them.) Place the file in the erf folder in your NWN install folder. If you haven't completed the SoU campaign yet, make sure the line\nCODEWORD XP1=ffrodriguez\nis in the [Game Options] section of your nwnplayer.ini file. In the Toolset, open the campaign module XP1-Chapter 1. Import the downlaoded file, overwriting all resources. Save the module as SoU-Chapter 1. Repeat this for XP1-Interlude and XP1-Chapter 2, each time changing \"XP1\" to \"SoU\" when you save.\n\nTo use the fix, you'll need to start a new game in one of these modules. Note that you must go through \"Other modules\" to use these modules; starting an official SoU campaign will not utilize this modification.\n_________________________\n\nThe \"Plus\" file contains what's in the basic file, and also includes some fixes that should cause your henchman to remember tactics from chapter to chapter. I haven't tested this though, so a typo might have slipped through. If you're not adventurous, use CryptMaze.erf.\n\nBoth files are tagged as requiring SoU 1.30, but they are based on the 1.67 files. When I tested CryptMaze.erf, I was running 1.67.\n\nThis fix should be completely compatible with Vulcano's Mischa add-on. (Yes, the directions for that add-on should sound similar. I borrowed a little of his setup.) However, if you want the \"Plus\" version, you need to import the Mischa add-on before importing this fix.\n\nIf you're looking for a fix in the middle of a game in progress, you might want to try downloading ud_crypt_03.ncs into your override folder. This should fix the maze in your current game, but could potentially cause problems in other modules. Only use this if you're already stuck in the maze.\n\nLet me know if this works for you.\n\n\nNew: The file xp1_pcisunholy.ncs is for people playing an evil cleric. This opens up a conversation branch written just for them. Just place this in your override directory, and you're good to go. (I'll add this file to the import at some later date, along with some other fixes.)","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1103":{"Title":"Color Help","Author":"Tanrisa","Submitted":20060602,"Updated":20060602,"Category":"Application","Format":"2da","Forums":"Color Help","Description":"I have run into a problem while making my Module; I need some latex-like clothing for my hookers.\nI therefor ask if anyone could help turn all palettes; Cloth 1, Cloth 2, Leather 1, Leather 2, Metal 1 and Metal 2 all 'latex-colored' (as shown on the picture).\nI need some help with this, so please post the file once you are finished, and I will use it.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1104":{"Title":"How To Make Custom Familiars and Animal Companions","Author":"Axe Murderer","Submitted":20060603,"Updated":20060604,"Category":"Tutorials","Format":"HTML","Forums":"Link","Description":"Step-by-step how to tutorial describing the process of adding custom familiars and/or animal companions to an NWN module.\n\nCheck out this link!\n|\nV","Rating":9.94,"Votes":11,"Awards":[]},"1106":{"Title":"Creating Fjords In NWN","Author":"Cyril","Submitted":20060604,"Updated":20060605,"Category":"Tutorials","Format":"Txt File","Description":"A basic tutorial on how to add fjords (shallow portions of rivers used for crossing) to your modules.

Well, now you can!\n\n\nCAVEATS:\n\n First, BACK UP STUFF! The author is not responsible for NWN, the Toolset, and/or your computer flaking out and destroying your saved game and/or original module. Yadda yadda, you know, the usual warning notices about monkeying with things mortals were never meant to touch in the first place.\n\n Second, DO NOT EDIT the area where the PCs were when you saved the game. If you change that, you'll lose the PCs.\n\n\nALTERNATE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n If you really do want to take the advice not to monkey in the affairs beyond mere mortals, here's a relatively easy alternate solution:\n\n1: Edit your original module. Paint down the start point in the place where the PCs were when you ended the last game session.\n\n2: If the players haven't already saved their characters out of the game, start up the saved game and have them do that. (You can skip this step if they haven't acquired any important plot items, money, XP, or other things necessary to survive.)\n\n3: Run the new version of the module and have the new saved characters join it. Continue where you left off.\n\n\nTHE ACTUAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n Okay, maybe none of that works for you (I don't think journal entries and quest logs are saved, local variables are a toss up, etc). So, here it is, how to edit those pesky saved games!\n\nEditing a Saved Game\n\n\n1: Open and edit the original .mod in the Toolset. Export any new/changed items/objects/creatures/areas/etc, to an ERF file.\n\n2: Open the ERF with NWN Packer or NWN Explorer. Extract all the files to a temp directory.\n\n3: Copy the .SAV saved game to a new directory. Use this for the edits, in case something goes wonky. The name must be < 16 characters, so change it.\n\n4: In NWN Hak: \nFile: Open:\n find *.sav and load your .sav'd game.\nRessource: Add:\n go to the temp directory and add the erf stuff.\nFile: Save:\n (save as won't work.)\n\n\nNWN Packer by Zoglio:\nhttp://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&id=308\n\nModified NWN Explorer by Roboius:\nhttp://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.Detail&id=248\n\n","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1124":{"Title":"Bloodsong's VoiceSet 2DA","Author":"bloodsong","Submitted":20060725,"Updated":20060725,"Category":"Utility","Format":"2da","Description":"yet another soundset.2da file for your override.\n\nwhat is different about this one?\n\n1: NOT all soundsets are accessible. a few popular animal sounds are: big cat and wolf for both male and female.

(In addition, my wife felt that there was a certain level of sexism in the artwork. While some people may not see the mostly tame art in NWN as sexist, it personally makes me and my wife feel that it encourages sexual sterotypes about women that we personally wanted to teach our children to disagree with.) \n\nMy son has also started to build mods and play them with NWN, so I build this child guard as a parental control.\n\nI have gathered artwork from NWVault and used them to override some of the more immodest images, particularly those that contained partial nudity, like the Succubus. I improved others as possible.\n\nWhile I did this strictly for myself, I thought I'd make it available anyhow.\n\nPlease note this only affects the portraits in the game, the load screens, the initial interfaces, and a few models. If an artists wishes to help with this, I'll be glad to expand the scope of this work. Unfortunately I simply don't have the artistic talent to do this on my own.\n\nUpdate: I have gotten a few responses from people very critical of the existence of this mod. It's not always possible for me to tell if these criticisms are sincere and thoughtful, misguided, or really just disguised hatred of choice. Due to the occasional posts I get from time to time, I ask that anyone that feels negatively over this mod, that does nothing but introduces additional parental choice, consider the following points before posting. If you post and it's obvious you didn't read this, don't expect to be taken seriously:\n\n* There is no requirement that you download this mod. No one will come to your door and break your knee caps if you don't. In fact, nothing at all will happen to you. Please bear in mind that only people that *want* to download this mod will ever do so.\n* I don't care to give out my child's age, but he's old enough to make mods. \n* NWN with the the violence turned all the way down changes the game so that defeated monsters merely fall over and disappear. It's much less violent then Bugs Bunny cartoons. It's the same level of violence as the E-rated Legend of Zelda.\n* I realize there are pacifists out there that sincerely won't let their kids watch Bugs Bunny cartoons because they are too violent, to say nothing of modern Y-7 cartoons like Batman. If this is you, please understand that I strongly disagree with you but also strongly respect your views. Feel free to post and tell me that you don't think it's okay for me to allow *any* kid to play NWN. I will simply respond and to say �I disagree with you, but your entitled to your opinion.� \n* On the other hand, I doubt anyone that's posted here so far is a pacifist because the real life ones I know wouldn't dream of supporting a game like NWN.\n* If you are not a pacifist, but honestly believe that allowing a child to see partial nudity like the Succubus, Dryad, and Nymph is better then having monsters fall down, you're certainly entitled to your opinion. However, I strongly disagree with you and I think you have some very messed up views of what is appropriate or inappropriate for children. Still, let's agree to disagree. \n* I originally wrote that last point as a joke. However, Shadowsilk tells me he really does take his children to nude beaches but doesn't let them watch Bugs Bunny. Shadowsilk and I very strongly disagree with the other's view of what's appropriate for children. We have agreed to disagree. To say I think he's making a mistake is an understatement. I'm sure he feels the same way about me for not taking my children to clothing optional beaches. \n* I also realize that there are people that somehow want to turn this into a �violence vs. sexuality in the media� discussion. While I encourage this discussion in an honest and civil manner, ignoring the obvious truth that it's a matter of degree is not helpful. Do you really believe XXX movies are more child-friendly than Bugs Bunny? Please state your full views so that I can respectfully respond to you and we can have a civil discussion.\n* Finally, if you are someone that so hates the idea of choice that you actually feel anger over this mod and want to sabotage it to make it go away (as PIGSgrame, miraceti, akibara, Akirosette, CharisaB, and Enigmaticatious tried before Maximus stopped them), my advice to you is to seek counsellings to over come your intolerance.\n\nIf you, for some reason, aren't aware of the growing body of research on the concerns over exposing children to \"sexualized\" images (i.e. images that emphasize a person�s value coming only from his or her sexual appeal or behavior to the exclusion of other characteristics) then please read this article before posting: Link\n\nOne final note: I would like to point out that the nudity mods on this site aren't nearly as controversial as this mod has turned to to be. I want people to honestly ask themselves why that is and if they are okay with that fact.","Rating":9.1,"Votes":3,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"1127":{"Title":"Saluk's NWN Module Installer - version 1","Author":"Saluk","Submitted":20060818,"Updated":20060821,"Category":"Application","Format":"Exe File","Description":"Update: Added the source code for linux users as well as those interested in how it works.

The main engine behind this is the Aurora Toolset, which allows users to create their own modules. No longer are they limited to what was created by the games developer originally. \nWhat we can do with the toolset is mind-boggling. However, with so much that you can do, where on earth do you start? That is where The Builder�s Project comes in. The Builder�s Project is a group of Neverwinter Nights and/or Dungeons and Dragons enthusiasts who have dedicated themselves to a few simple objectives:\ni)To reach as many new module builders as possible and get them educated in the use of the NWN and NWN2 Toolset. We want to do this within the framework of the membership, but we see no reason to make any info published by the guild private in any way.\nii)To provide a support system for module builders.\niii)To gather, pool and make available any resources we encounter regarding module building, with the intent of aiding our members and the community at large in the pursuit of module building.\niv)To provide a means of sharing knowledge and experience in module building, foster an atmosphere of collective education, and further the purpose of making our membership competent and capable builders. \nTo that end, the Builder�s Project has been collecting information on every aspect of module building and keeping track of the questions frequently asked on the forums and the answers provided to these questions. All this information is stored and edited in what we call The Guide To Building.\n***\nThe Guide to Building will be released in several instalments, each covering an important aspect of module building. The purpose of this second instalment, titled \"The Design Manual\", is to provide the builder with a set of suggestions and guidelines to help build better, more complete and enjoyable modules. This manual should, however not be viewed as an attempt to establish an authority over methods for designing and building modules. The suggestions contained herein are just that suggestions. Not every topic has been thoroughly explored here so there will be issues not fully addressed, or not addressed at all, due in large part to this being a huge, complex, subject.\nDesigning and building NWN or NWN2 modules can be a difficult proposition for any builder; even a veteran builder. Difficulties can develop for anyone. No one system of module creation is superior to another. Each builder is a different person and their individual strengths and weaknesses will be different, therefore each and every idea presented here in this guide should be seen as a tool to use to make your module what you want of it � not a gospel claiming to be �The right way�, or even, �The best way� to make a module.\n\nREVISIONS\nv0.05 added more content","Rating":9.1,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"1165":{"Title":"CEP Setup Mage v1.68 by Axe","Author":"Axe Murderer","Submitted":20061202,"Updated":20080711,"Category":"Custom Content Tools","Format":"Exe File","Forums":"Link","Description":" Axe Murderer's CEP Setup Mage v1.68 by Axe\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis package includes a setup installer package that you can run to install CEP Setup Mage v1.68 on your computer.\n\nCEP Setup Mage v1.68 is a Windows program that helps you install CEP1 &/or CEP2 v1.0 into your NWN game folders.

All original 2DA and dialog.tlk are imported in an internal database at first start - for quick access.\nWhile editing your 2DA TabularFramework always displays the corresponding TLK Entry as readable text in the status bar - from both dialog.tlk and your custom.tlk! If tlks are loaded the entry is shown there, too.\n\nYou can easily import an original 2DA and save as it as own 2DA and immediately edit it. To give you a better overview you can fix several columns (always displayed left side) and/or hide columns you don`t nead at the moment. The program saves this option per each filename, so it`s works with original and your own 2DA!\nCopy and Paste rows between different files.

Beim ersten Start werden alle Original 2DA und die Dialog.tlk in eine interne Datenbank eingelesen, macht vieles schneller!\n\nTabularFramework zeigt während des Bearbeitens von 2DA immer die dazu passenden TLK Einträge als Text in der Statusleiste an, meiner Meinung nach einen unschätzbarer Vorteil. Dabei unterscheidet das Programm zwischen Einträgen aus der dialog.tlk und der Eigenen TLK.\n\nMan kann Original 2DA einlesen und als eigene wieder abspeichern und bearbeiten. Anders als beim NWN2-Toolset kann man jederzeit wählen, ob man eine Original oder eine eigene 2DA laden möchte. Ein weiterer großer Vorteil ist, daß man mehrer Spalten fixieren kann (die werden immer am linken Rand angezeigt) und/oder Spalten ausblenden, die man nicht benötigt. Dabei merkt sich das Programm die Einstellung anhand des Dateinamens, also wirken sich die Einstellungen auf Original und eigene 2DA gleichermassen aus.\n\nKopieren und Einfügen von ganzen Zeilen, löschen (mit **** füllen) von ganzen Zeilen.

You don't need to rescript everything and you won't lose your database.\n\n\nModified by Qwildurn *** 10 July 2008\nqwildurn@verizon.net\nLink to Qwildurn's DND Server\n\nFor the purpose of converting Fast French to work with NWNX2 and 1.69\nFast French no longer functions with 1.69 \n\nThis will replace 3 files:\naps_include\nff_inc_server\nff_include\n\nFast French needs to be installed and working correctly with 1.68 first.\nYou should use the ERF to update your module. Ignore the errors \nand overwrite the three files. \n\nIf you've made other changes to these files, I've included the .NSS files in \ntheir raw.\n\nAfter patching the three include files, you need to build your module to compile all the scripts.\n\nYou should delete ALL the Fast French files from your NWN folder and install the newest NWNX files from: NWNX.ORG\nAt minimum, you will need NWNX2 and OBDC. You don't need any MySQL .dll files.\nJust add MySQL to NWNX.INI as in the below example.\n\nDo not use the Profiler. It is said that the Profiler has stopped working \nwith the 1.69 upgrade. Fast French has a profiler built in. I have not actually tried NWNX2 with the profiler, but I am getting good results.\n\nThis is not perfected, but I fixed the MAJOR errors.\nAt this time, the Delete Char function works, but the Server Reset does not.\nWithout a rewrite of the original NWNX code, the Server Reset probably won't \never work.\n\nNWNX.ini needs to have these lines to use MySQL\n\n[ODBC2]\n; Log file\nMaxLogSize = 512 ; in KByte\nLogLevel = 2 ; 0=nothing, 1=only errors, 2=everything\n\n; Use these two settings for the SQLite internal database\n;source = sqlite\n;file = sqlite.db\n\n; Use these two settings for ODBC connections\n;source = odbc\n;dsn = nwn\n\n; Use these five settings for MySQL connections \nsource = mysql \nserver = localhost\n;server = 210.105.003.196:3306\n;server = qwildurn.game-host.org\nuser = root\npwd = password\ndb = database\n\n\n\nIf you want to connect to a MySQL server over the internet (I do), \nchange \"localhost\" to the correct IP. I host my own web so I can use part of my web name. If you need to use a non-standard MySQL port (:3306 is standard), add the port on as in the above example.\n\nNow your mod should be ready to go. You should be able to continue using your\nexisting MySQL database tables without any loss of information. If you want a \nnice MySQL viewer/editor, try SQLyog.\n\nIf you find any bugs that you can't resolve, please email me so I can look into it. Then I can post the changes here.\nqwildurn@verizon.net\nLink to Qwildurn's DND Server\n\nQwildurn Bluemoon\nServer host of BadLands RPG\n\nSeptember 2008\nAdded fixes for file delete and server reset. I did not make the .dll files. For the most part, I did write the scripts.\n\nIt has been about three months now since I made this \"fix\" for Fast French to NWNX and I have not had to post any changes. My server and it's database are doing well.\nI have received a few emails asking about this and that. I've replied to them all with what I thought the answer was. All were just simple adjustments to nwnx.ini mostly.\nSeveral have asked about the black screen at logon. \n\nIf you are being booted at logon, it's probably because there is no connection to the database. You can�t see the error message on the screen because \"ff_on_cl_enter� uses �BlackScreen�. I disabled that on my server. You should disable �FadeFromBlack� as well.\n\nqwildurn@verizon.net\nLink to Qwildurn's DND Server\n\nQwildurn\n\n21 Sept 2008\nFixed broken links to download files.\nAdded missing instructions to the Server Reset fix.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1321":{"Title":"List of Horses for 1.69/CEP2.1","Author":"williamushunteri","Submitted":20080715,"Updated":20080717,"Category":"Spreadsheet","Format":"Excel","Forums":"Link","Description":"I made this list to aid myself in the creation of a detailed conversation for selling horses to my players.

Place all files in your override folder. There are also 2 separate folders for men and women characters that allow you to pick any of the portraits and soundsets when you make your character. Put the appropriate one in the override folder. The 2das allow you put just about any property on any item, but you must realize though that even though you put the property on the item, it may be stripped in a Online Server if they don't allow the property on the item. New spells have been added to the iprp_spells.2da so you can throw new objects in my servers I host. The list can be found on lines 541-569 in iprp_spels.2da which is the respective subtypes for the spells so you can add them manually. Most of the new spells in toolset are listed as Flying Debris or Beholder Special Attack. Bioware didn't name some of the spells appropriately because they aren't meant to be used by players in the game. I could have named them with random names from the game, but you still wouldn't really now what the spell is. I've also added the regen fix I created for 1.67 and is still used in my uber server. On your Armor or Hide add the property for OnHitCastSpell Regenerate. Make sure you don't add any other onhitcastspell property or else the regen won't work. You can only have one onhitcastspell property work properly when you are hit. \n\n**Added baseitems.2da so you can use just about every item as a 2 wep fighting as well as wear them as a helmet.

The previous Lexicon version by the NWN Lexicon Group from November 2004 contained content through 1.64. This update includes content through 1.69. \n\nSummary of Major Changes: \n- Updated and added to the constants pages to reflect the new 1.69 content. This includes screenshots of the new visual effects. \n- Updated function pages to reflect new parameters added in 1.69 content. \n- Added pages for the new functions added in 1.69 content. \n- Added page for new event added in 1.69 content. \n- Populated the index tab that went missing in the 1.68 update. \n- Re-enabled search capability that ran off the with index tab in the 1.68 update. \n- Updated the table of contents with the new pages. \n- Limited updates to all the library file pages. \n- Added numerous new library file pages and new pages for the functions contained within them. \n- New tutorials for color charts, compiler errors, custom tokens, factions, lag reduction, and number conversion. As well as massive updates to the script caching tutorial. \n- Added Proleric�s horse and scaling tutorial. \n- Updated the resource pages for creatures, items, sounds and placeables to include the new 1.69 content. \n\nFor a full, and annoyingly detailed list of all the changes, take a look at the change log within the chm file. \n\nKookoo and Mistress would like to thank all of the following contributors that jumped on board to help with the 1.69 update. An amazing amount of extra work and additions were added because of it. Axe Murderer, Baragg, Fireboar, FunkySwerve, Graewerld, Hue-Tsi, Jimmy Buffet, Ken Cotterill, Kolyana, motu99, Phann, Proleric, ShaDoOoW, Sunjammer, and Tyndrel.\n\nKudos definitely goes to the original Lexicon team.

At this point, we will be going back to our so called �real lives�. There will be no further updates from the team.

By simply changing the value of one variable on each trigger you can fire different threads on a single conversation. Write whatever you like in each thread and the conversation will show that dialogue. \n\nThis file consists of a conversation, a trigger, and 11 scripts.\n\nTo use, extract into you erf folder, which is in the NWN folder. Then open up the toolset and click on the \"file\" button at the top toolbar. Then go to import and grab the file.\n\nTo use, lay a trigger down where you want it. Then open up the variables on it. The variable will be called \"NARRATE_\" The value on the base trigger is \"1\" That is fine for the first trigger. If you want to narrate another area, change the value to \"2\", and so on.\n\nIn the conversation, there are 10 threads. Put the words that you want in thread 1. That will be activated by trigger 1. It does this by looking at the variable you set on the trigger. If you set the variable on the trigger to 2, it will activate the second thread in the conversation. \n\nOne of the scripts is already set on the trigger. That script reads the variable on the trigger and sets it on the player. It also makes sure that the trigger only fires once for each player. \n\nThe next ten scripts are conditional scripts that check what variable was set. There is one for each of the 10 threads. If you want more than 10 threads, just change the value in the script to 11, and so on.\n\nGood building.\n\nKookoo\n\nUpdated 10-29-8\n1.

The script source (.NSS) can be compiled into binary form (.NCS) in the Aurora Toolset or via commandline tools (CLCOMPILE.EXE or NWNNSSCOMP.EXE).\n\nThe binary form can also be decompiled into byte codes by NWNNSSCOMP.\n\nFor those who are interested, this program demonstrates how to assemble the bytecodes into the binary form using a batch file and FASM.\n\nThe sample bytecode source file (example.nsm) looks like this:\n\nconsts \"Hello World!\"\n GetFirstPC\nSendMessageToPC\nretn\n\nand means in terms of nwscript:-\n\nvoid main()\n{\n SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),\"Hello World!);\n}\n\nSo what does this all mean? Probably not much. It is an alternate way to code scripts and may allow (possibly, I think) one to produce binary output that are not possible before.\n\nps. The output produced by NSM is for Neverwinter Nights v1.69 and may not work in earlier versions.\n\nps2. The files inside the include directory are scripts that translate bytecodes. NW.INC in particular contains the byte code definitions. NWFUNC.INC holds the NWScript engine routines, and NWCONST.INC the constants.\n\nUpdates\n9/11/2008:\n- Fixed JMP, JSR, JZ, JNZ\n- Added support for parameters \n- Fixed declaration of floats","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1358":{"Title":"NWN SoU+HotU 1.69 camera mod v2 - UpDated 02/10/09","Author":"Roma_CZ","Submitted":20081109,"Updated":20090801,"Category":"Code Modification","Format":"Exe File","Description":"NWN SoU+HotU 1.69 camera mod.\n\n**************************************\nNow UpDated to version 2 - what's new?\nI tried to eliminate perspective distortions.\nThere is a decreased limit to max. distance and camera's angle is corrected too.\nIt schould make ingame using more comfortable.\n**************************************\n\nUnofficial NWMAIN.EXE modification.\n1.

It re-interprets & integrates hitherto isolated historical events, legends & myths across the �Known World� of the 2nd millennium B.C.E., climaxing with a global climatological cataclysm that triggered the collapse of civilizations world-wide & ushered in an Age of Darkness, before the emergence of \"classical\" ancient civilization(s) of the 1st millenia B.C.E.\n\nAdapted for NeverWinter Nights I, LFA version 0.3.0 consists of:\n\n·An epic, multi-module Single-Player Campaign of the same name (i.e., LFA v0.3.0, per se),\n· A massive Multi-Player Persistent World (i.e., Wr�Alda), and\n·A comprehensive Fantasy Universe Creation Kit \n\nLament For Åltlân\n-----------------\nThere are nine (9) major modules in this collection comprising LFA v0.3.0 proper. These span a [more than] 700-year period of history, from the catastrophic submersion of Åltlân & the history-changing migrations of the remnant refugee populations therefrom, to the First War of the Gods. \n\nThese modules are organized into three trilogies, each consisting of three chapters which describe a major period in the of history of the Free Folk, who were the descendants of one of these refugee peoples. \n\nWithin each trilogy, Player Characters progress & age from one chapter to the next. Between trilogies ~ which typically are hundreds of years apart in game time ~ Player Characters �survive� from one major era to the next as avatars using an incarnation system unique to LFA.\n\n[Spoiler Alert... The ultimate moral of the story: \nA society centrally organized around dogmatic principles of racial purity & superiority is inexorably, karmic-ly doomed... As Daleks & the Borg like to say: \"Resistance is futile!\"]\n\n\nWr'Alda, the Persistent World\n-----------------------------\nWr�Alda (literally, �All That Is� = the World) is a persistent world server based on the LFA v0.3.0 universe, set in the Dark Ages that followed in the aftermath of the Last GodWar. It is a low- to moderate-magic world emphasizing adventure, role-playing, social interaction & diplomacy, puzzle-solving, and genre-consistent realism.\n\n\nFantasy Universe Creation Kit\n-----------------------------\nThe Fantasy Universe Creation Kit is an �all-in-one� combination set of custom content coupled with a universal base module & an extendable, core scripting framework to form a world building system to allow aspiring DMs & Builders to create modules, campaigns & alternate persistent worlds based on the LFA universe.\n\n\nBackground:\n-----------\nThe LFA / Wr'Alda milieu was inspired by the following primary sources:\n\nMarija Gimbutas� �Old Europe� & Kurgan Mytho-Archaeological Hypotheses [ Link ]\n� which posit that an idyllic, egalitarian, matriarchal civilization once peacefully ruled over an eastern- & southern European realm during the Late Neolithic ~to~ Late Bronze Ages, before becoming overwhelmed, supplanted & assimilated by invading , nomadic, patrilineal warrior tribes migrating from Asia.\n\nGimbutas� now-disputed theories have been adapted & expanded in LFA, extending her Old European domain to include all of western & northern Europe. Geopolitically, this realm is elevated to near-�Empire� status, consisting of a loosely-knit confederation of tribal �nations� that are culturally bound together by their common belief in & dutiful worship of a single Earth-Mother Goddess, all governed by an elected �Folk Mother� who is also the High Priestess of the cult of the Goddess.\n\nThêt Öera Linda Bok [ Link ] \n� a controversial Old Frisian manuscript ~ now generally understood to be a hoax ~ that alleges Europe was, for most of its [pre-]history, ruled by a succession of Folk-Mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess Frya. Frya is the principal adept of the mysteries of Seiódh and one of three daughters of the supreme god Wr-alda and Irtha, the Earth Mother. The book is the first known example of the concept of �root races�, an under-pinning of Madame Blavatsky�s later Theosophical writings. Here Frya is claimed to be the progenitor of the �White Folk�, while her sisters, Llyda & Finnda, are purportedly the mothers of the Black (or Brown) and Yellow races, respectively.\n\nThe earliest portion of the Book, namely Frya�s Tex, purports to have been composed in 2194 B.C.E. by refugees fleeing a Great Flood that submerged their home land, Altlân (the �Old Land�). These people become a powerful nation of merchant sea kings & governor-priestesses, establishing colonies & enclaves across the globe in Britain, Sardinia, Tunis, Greece [�Kreka�] & the Ionian Isles, Crete & Phoenicia, and even � eventually � ancient Peru & the Punjab. \n\nMore than half the book is consumed by a portion entitled �The Book of Adela�s Followers�, which tells of the travails that the Children of Frya face seeking to maintain their lands, culture & society, and [sadly] racial purity in the face of invasive pressure from a vassal race of pastoral warrior-mages (the �Magyar� & �Finnar�) who, in turn, are being driven north- & west-ward by an unnamed race of even-more-fearful overlords originating out of Asia.\n\nJurgen Spanuth�s �Atlantis of the North� [ Link ] \n� a debunked speculative archaeology, once a staple amongst the �occult Nazi� intelligentsia, which asserts that Plato�s Atlantis existed in the North Sea in the area of today's island of Heligoland. This island is also claimed to be identical to the King Island (Basileia) of the Phaeacians from the stories of Homer (primarily, the Odyssey). \n\nSpanuth�s theory claims the isle�s submersion was triggered by the impact of (or near-collision with) a comet. This catasptrophic celestial event is purportedly reflected in various legends world-wide (e.g., The Egyptians� Sekhmet , the Greeks� Phaeton myth, in the Avesta as Tistrya, and with the Norse as Ragnarok).\n\nThe Aesir~Vanir War(s) of Norse Mythology [ Link ]\n� as described in the Völuspá of the Poetic Edda, and in the works of Snorri Sturluson (i.e., Skáldskaparmál of the Prose Edda, and the YnglingaSsaga of the Heimskringla). \n\nThe Vanir (�Friends�; alt. �Free Folk�, or �They Who Strive�?) were an indigenous race of fair-haired & fair-skinned Gods & Goddesses, closely associated with the Light Elves & expert in the arts of earth magic, who fought a series of wars against the Aesir (literally, �Men of Asia�), but were eventually assimilated into the latter pantheon.\n\nHomer's \"Iliad\" & \"Odyssey\"\nAppolonius of Rhodes' \"Argonautika\"\n� which recount events that roughly mark the end and the beginning, repsectively, of the [alternate] historical period in question. 'Nuff said� \n\n\nVarious Fantasy Authors� \n� in rough order of influence:\nJRR Tolkein (LotR, Silmarillion)\nMichael Scott Rohan (Winter of the World series)\nJudith Tarr (Avaryan Chronicles, Queen of the Amazons, The Shepherd Kings, White Mare's Daughter)\nStorm Constantine (Magravandias series)\nRobert E.

As everyone has noticed, NWN's graphics are a bit old. There are a few projects to help with this, especially chico400's awesome NWNCQ and Project Q, but those only go so far. NWShader picks up with going under the game and turning on a bunch more features. \nThings like depth of field, bloom, and even Crysis-style SSAO are possible.\nNWShader supports fullscreen and material shaders. Fullscreen shaders are special effects added to the whole scene after the game draws it, and are used for color changes and lens effects. Materials apply to a particular texture and change how an object is drawn. Special effects such as skin, velvet, edge glow, normal maps, parallax and glow mapping are all possible.\n\nNWShader gives artists an unprecedented level of control over how their work is shown in the game. Using a simple, but powerful, XML-based material framework, artists can add material without ever touching shader code. Shader authors can control every step of the drawing process, from vertex location to texturing to lighting, and add custom methods for any object. \n\nAn experimental plugin system is also available. With a little bit of programming know-how, PW admins and anyone else interested can write new script commands for their world and interface with NWShader, Windows/Linux, the internet, or even other programs.\nNeed your elemental planes to use a shader? Need to log each player who enters your area? Want to \"tweet\" from in-game? Want your module to automatically check for, download, and notify the player of updates? Plugins are capable of anything code can do, and can be written in a variety of languages (they are just DLLs).\n\nNWShader is under rapid development, and any effort to help test and report bugs would be greatly appreciated. All comments, questions, complaints, or anything else is welcome, just post, PM, or email. \n\n07.13.2010: \"Chronepsis\" released!\nMore script functions, dynamic shaders and material system, HDR, soft focus, optimizations, partial localization support and 5 packaged languages: English, Francais, Espanol, Deutsch and Italiano.","Rating":10,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"1446":{"Title":"Q.dot's In-game Camera Wizard","Author":"Q.dot","Submitted":20100309,"Updated":20100309,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","Description":"This is a simple .erf file that comes with a collection of scripts and 1 dialog.

But which bug will it fix?\nA. Sometimes in game (NwN 1.69), a henchman could stop fighting, staying here without doing anything while the PC is fighting. This seems to happen only in big fights. For example, You can meet this problem in HotU campaign with Nathyrra (for sure) and maybe Aribeth.\n\nQ. Why this Bug ?\nA. At some point in the hard fights, the IA of the henchman will try to get the best talent in category 10 (self enhancement) and return what it finds, which is ... the FEAT_HORSE_MENU! So it thinks it catches a valid talent, and continue next round to use it, and again, and again... This just does nothing, and the henchman is \"fighting\" without doing any actions... The reason of that is in the \"feat.2da\" file. The FEAT_HORSE_MENU and his other \"FEAT_HORSE_xxx\" friends are set to category 10 which is obviously a bad idea.\n\nQ. What is my fix ?\nA. I extracted the feat.2da from the xp2patch in my game, and changed the FEAT_HORSE_xxx things of number category : 10 -> 79 (could have been any number not used for a category). This should change nothing in game, except that bug's correction. \n\n----------------------------------------\nInstall this fix\n\nPut my \"feat.2da\" file into your override folder of the game to fix the bug.

Modified the method in which it locates the TMI Limit location in memory, this needed to have the 3rd and 7th Bytes left out of the comparison, since these were parts of the code that would be changed by the plugin.\n2.

It looped about 23822 times, I then used SimTools to change the TMI Limit via the following command from chat bar.\ndm_setvarmodstring NWNX!TMI!SET 16\n\nThis effectively set the limit to 4 times what it was, and the observed result when running the same script, gave me\n95315 entries in my log file (which subsequently rose to be 3mb in size because of all the text) \n\nIs 95315 4x 23822, No.... but its close enough, there are other variables that affect the amount of code being able to get executed before a TMI gets kicked off, so the number could vary a little, but the fact that it did increase by such a large amount, shows the power that this functionality can give.\n\n\nNote - It can be a two edged sword.\nIf you raise it too high, it may cause unpredictable effects.\nMy suggestion would be to raise it when needed, and lower it.\n\n\nHow to use?\nSimply set a Local String on the module, or anything for that matter, which has the variable name of\n\nNWNX!TMI!SETLIMIT and set the value of this string, to be the number of what size cap you want.\neg - 16 = 8 times the normal value.\nI run with 8 on my server, which is 4 times the norm - and it doesnt cause any problems.\n\nIncluded in the package, are instructions both from myself, and from Addicted2rpg on the use of the plugin.\n\nSource code is included, for anyone who wants to continue the work of trying to get Toggle Unlimited working - function declarations are commented out for unlimited.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1483":{"Title":"Wow Class icons","Author":"Baal Arès","Submitted":20110113,"Updated":20110113,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","Description":"Class icons inspired by World of Warcraft Class icons","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1484":{"Title":"Resting  wand aka Wand of Mana","Author":"Calgacus","Submitted":20110205,"Updated":20110303,"Category":"Other","Format":"Various","Forums":"Link","Description":"These files will allow you to rest your character and any other creature whenever you want - bypassing module resting restrictions.\nJust drop the two files into your override folder and then in game point at the ground beside your pc and then issue the \"DebugMode 1\" and \"dm_spawnitem manawand\" console commands.

It was recompiled by Alessandro Borges in order to work with newer versions of Java 3D- which is required to run the program!\n\nClick HERE to view a tutorial on how to use the model viewer, on YouTube\n\nAfter unpacking to a folder, run nwm.bat. If your Java 3D is installed correctly, 4 windows are going to come up. On the left will be a list of models in the same directory as the program. The center window will show you whatever model happens to be loaded at the moment. The right window will contain a list of animations to choose from if the model has any. This model viewer will display animations for models which are supermodeled into other models as long as the models in the chain are in ASCII and reside in the program's directory. It appears to load the entire supermodel chain for viewing. Finally, at the bottom is the \"NWN Control Panel\", which will allow you to adjust settings for how the models are viewed. Looking at the output in the DOS box which is created when clicking on the nwm.bat file will yield valuable information about how the program is processing the models/emitters/etc. That information, along with error windows which pop up when you try to view a model can be very useful for figuring out why it's not able to read the model and in some cases, allow you to make minor changes to the model so it can.\n\nAt the bottom of the \"NWN Control Panel\" are 3 tabs (Geometry, Appearance, Animation). Because of the placement of the bottom window, you will probably have to move that window up a bit to see them. Without knowing these 3 tabs are there you'll be missing out on some of the neater features of the model viewer.\n\nFeatures:\n* Displays models, emitters, tiles, etc.\n* Simulates NWN particle system fairly well\n* Can \"explode\" models, show skeletons, label nodes of models\n* Will display animations for one model supermodeled into another as long as all models in the chain are in the program's directory, in ASCII\n\nLimitations:\n* Can't load models with skin mesh\n* Won't load some models. You can sometimes correct this by carefully reading the error and making changes accordingly.\n* May sometimes incorrectly display textures on a model, possibly ones with danglymesh\n* Doesn't display P2P Emitters\n\nInstallation Troubleshooting:\nFIRST, make sure you have the Java runtime installed before installing Java 3D!\n\nClick HERE to test your Java version.\nMy version shows as Java Version: 1.6.0_22 from Sun Microsystems Inc.\n\nClick HERE to test whether your Java 3D is working. You can also check Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows to see what version of Java 3D you have installed.\nMy Add/Remove Programs shows the following versions of Java 3D installed, probably because I updated to a newer version after installing originally:\nJava 3D 1.5.1\nJava 3D 1.5.2\n\nThe above versions are the ones I use and the tool runs fine under them.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1492":{"Title":"NWN Omnibus","Author":"OldTimeRadio","Submitted":20110414,"Updated":20111101,"Category":"Application","Format":"Other","Forums":"Link","Description":"An ENORMOUS collection of searchable NWN reference material in one place!\n\nView the introduction on YouTube, HERE\n\nWhat is the NWN Omnibus?\nIt is an attempt to gather the majority of NWN reference material together in one place and allow very quick keyword searching against all of the documents at once. It includes reference documents as well as forum threads.\n\nWho is going to get the most out of the NWN Omnibus?\nAny NWN Custom Content creator or NWScript writer who finds themselves frequently searching through the old BioWare forums using Google, the NWN Lexicon, or the BioWare \"For Developers\" documents for specific topics. Since so much raw information is available for searching, those who will get the very most out of the Omnibus are individuals who already have a decent working knowledge of how Custom Content and NWScript work but who often find themselves needing to look up specific keywords or topics to further advance their pursuits.\n\nIs it complete?\nNo! This release of the NWN Omnibus comes with a huge amount of information to search through but I still think there's more useful information which can be included in the future. Offline versions of the DLA Custom Content Wiki, a few more of the old archived BioWare forums, reference sheets for BioWare tileset textures...and so on, and so on. I encourage others to experiment with their own combination of reference materials, customizing the Omnibus so it is most useful for their needs. \n\nWhat program drives the NWN Omnibus?\nThe Omnibus is a customized version of a portable DocFetcher distribution. You can also find the Wiki for DocFetcher here.\n\nWhat programs were used to make the NWN Omnibus?\nSince DocFetcher works best with html, most of the programs involved were tools which converted (whatever) to html. For PDF conversion, I used pdftohtml. For CHM, CHMDecoder. For downloading the BioWare forums, I used ForumD\n\nDoes having the NWN Omnibus mean I don't need to download all that other reference material, individually?\nWell...yes and no. It depends on how knowledgeable you are in the first place. For the most part, you shouldn't need to download the information separately. But because there is an enormous amount of material in the Omnibus and because the material has been converted to html from various other formats (like PDF or CHM) some of the material might not look as good as it does in its original form. Good examples of material which didn't convert as well as I would like are portions of Eligio Sacateca's Custom Content Guide and script snippets from the BioWare Scripting forum. In cases like that, the NWN Omnibus helps at least pinpoint whether a particular resource has information on the topic one is searching for. Remember, the NWN Omnibus is a powerful topic search tool. Trying to learn the basics of Custom Content from the NWN Omnibus' version of Custom Content Guide is going to be quite a bit more difficult than just reading through Eligio's guide directly.\n\nCan I add my own information into the NWN Omnibus?\nYes, DocFetcher is extremely flexible and allows adding or removing indices quite easily. Download the portable version and play around with making your own customized distributions. If you release DocFetcher-friendly modules to the Vault, just drop me a PM on the BioWare social site (or write me from my Vault profile) and I'll try to add a link to your entry.\n\nHow do I install and run it?\nJust unpack it to a folder on your hard drive with about 500 megabytes free and you're good to go! It should also work perfectly from a USB thumb drive. Just run DocFetcher.exe (or DocFetcher.sh for Linux, I believe)\n\nWhat information does this release of the NWN Omnibus contain?\n2DA 169 - All 575 .2DA files, current to the 1.69 release\n\n3DS Max Export Scripts - BioWare 3DS Max export scripts documentation, which includes a good deal of information on NWN Custom Content in general. Downloadable separately here\n\nBioWare For Developers - All 22 documents covering NWN file formats (and other things) from this page\n\nBioWare Forums - Offline archives of the following forums from the old BioWare website, each thread in its own .HTML file. The following full forum archives from the old BioWare site are included in this release: NWN Custom Content (ARCHIVE), BioWare News Discussion, Custom Content, For Developers, Scripting, Server Admin & Toolset. Also Stickied threads for every forum were included.\n\nCustom Content Guide 3.0 - The \"Bible\" of Custom Content. Downloadable separately here.\n\nGMax & Maxscript Help - Help files for GMax (3DS Max 4) and Maxscript, downloadable separately here\n\nLexicon 169 - The \"Bible\" of NWScript (and many, many other things as well!), downloadable separately here\n\nTileset Construction - BioWare's NWN Tileset Construction Tutorial, downloadable separately here. I don't include any of the files, just index the information.\n\nTXI - Every TXI officially released by BioWare as part of their content, segregated by the bif they were found in.

(As of this writing, it has had 803 votes, combining the current and old voting systems.) It is an independent utility that lets you describe what you want to happen in your module, then it provides a script to accomplish that task. The script can then be copied into the Toolset's script editor, for inclusion in your module. (The script can also be appended to a module or .erf by the Script Generator, if desired.) The idea is to enable a builder with little (or no) knowledge of NWScript to create functioning modules. It is intended to be easy to use, and to cover many more cases than the Toolset's script wizard.\n\nThis revision of Lilac Soul's program contains several enhancements. Most notable for users may be the inclusion of 1.69 capabilities, such as setting descriptions. It also produces cleaner scripts, which should be more suitable for use as a learning mechanism. Plus, there were a few old bugs squashed and some features expanded. If you want to see the complete list, grab the change log (one of the below files). Here, I'll just list the 1.69 functionality (in no particular order).\n\n The palette window reads the \"x3\" .bif (horse blueprints mostly).\n PDK has been added to the class choices.\n Alignment adjustments can be for just the PC, not the party.\n New appearances, wings, tails, and visual effects added to the lists.\n Added support specifically for scaled appearances.\n Descriptions can be changed.\n Creature colors can be changed (for part-based appearances).\n Paladin mounts can be summoned and dismissed.\n Horses can be mounted and dismounted.\n\nAlso of note are the presence of comments throughout the generated scripts. Any text in a script that appears after \"//\" can be changed as you see fit, normally to make it easier to remember what the script does.\n\nWhile I did have to drop some support features of Lilac Soul's version 2.3 (e.g. I am not running a mailing list to notify people of updates), I hope the end result is still found to be useful.

You can redownload installer or simply download dialog.tlk_GE.7z archive and extract it in your NWN folder (NOT tlk folder!) and overwrite old files.\nUPDATE 12.12.2011: Fixed spell casting issue on servers without Patch. Please re-download Patch if you have issues with casting spells in multiplayer.\n\nABOUT THE PATCH\n\nThe Community patch 1.70 is an unofficial patch, that is compiled from work of numerous NWN community members and completed by Shadooow. \"I dare to say that this update is the largest collection of fixes and unique features whatsoever. It took over year to put all of this together and detect/eliminate any issues that could been raised by doing this. But here we are and I hope that community appreciate this effort.\" Shadooow\n\nThis patch does work almost the same way as old official patches in past. The only difference is that, the Community patch doesn't affect the game version and its fully compatible with previous official patch - 1.69, so players without will still be able to play on servers with the patch and viceversa. Also, players without patch will still be able to see your server in gamespy server list. Installing onto lower game version is probably possible, but wasn't tested and its not recommmended. The same goes for game without expansions.\n\nAlso, this patch is fully compatible with any custom content like CEP, PRC, Project Q etc. meaning, that if you install the patch, non of these will break, everything will still work fine. But obviously you won't take advantage of all patch features and fixes until you (or CEP/PRC/Q team) merge 2das (and spell scripts). This is standard behaviour of any patch. It was always like this, the problem now is that its quite a while and nobody expected there will ever be another patch, so merging could be quite problematic...\n\nABOUT PATCH CONTENT\n\nThere was a lot of controversy about what is included in this patch. But most, if not all these doubts were caused by misinterpretations of certain fixes which wasn't fully explained. There are a lot of different issues and not everyone was aware of them and some folks who didn't even knew how that things worked or whats was broken on it misinterpreted my fix/change and instead they ask, they simply stated that the Patch is wrong.\n\nAlso note that this project doesn't fixes only so called \"confirmed\" bugs. Certain NWN experts claim that not everything is a bug unless it's definitely clear and confirmed. But since there is noone who could really confirm what is bug and what is not, an opinions on certain issues vary. Therefore this project describe bug as anything that doesn't make a sense. This is why despite the fact that the Bioware clearly stated that they know about UMD issue and that it was intented, Patch 1.70 changed and \"fixed\" it anyway. It simply didn't make sense.\n\nDue to this fact its hard to distinguish between a feature or a fix, but it shouldn't matter. Every single change included in this patch was designed to be balanced for all kinds of environments and game types and mainly: to make sense.\n\nThe patch contains also many new and unique features, like a possibility to make a trap with DC of 65 and damage of 500-1000. Of course none of these features are \"on\" by default. Its simply a possibility for buiders of specific environments and its up to them if they uses it or not.\n\nINSTALLATION\n1) choose the installer (all languages inside - should run also under WINE) or manual instalation package with desired language\n2) close all NWN instaces\n3) run installer or extract all files from package to the NWN folder and allow overwrite everything\n4) And thats it.\n\nThe game without both expansion is not supported and neither will be.\n\nAUTO 2DA MERGER\n\nThis wonderfull utility is located in 1.70 builder resources and allows to automatically merge all your 2das with the patch's 1.70 changes. To do this you have to only copy all your 2das into folders \"yours\" and then run the program from one of the batch files. See README.txt in the folder with automerger for more details.\n\nUNINSTALLATION\n\nIn case of any issues its possible to revert to 1.69 easily using 1.69 critical rebuild.","Rating":7.29,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"1514":{"Title":"Eucliwood Hellscythe Portrait","Author":"Contrast","Submitted":20111211,"Updated":20111226,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","Description":"This is a portrait pack from the necromancer-girl from the anime: \"Kore wa zombie desu ka?\" , Eucliwood Hellscythe\n\nEnjoy :3","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1515":{"Title":"Saeko Busujima portrait","Author":"Contrast","Submitted":20111213,"Updated":20111226,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","Description":"In this portrait pack you can find the portraits from Saeko Busujima, one of the main protagonists of the anime: \"Highschool of the dead\"\n\nEnjoy! :3","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1516":{"Title":"BioWare's PLT Exporter Plugin and Templates","Author":"BioWare","Submitted":20111214,"Updated":20111215,"Category":"Custom Content Tools","Format":"Various","Forums":"Link","Description":"This is the BioWare Photoshop PLT Exporter plugin which was available from the Miscellaneous Tools section on the old BioWare website.

This is a modification of Lilac Soul's BioSearcher v2.0 to make the search aware of patch 1.69 scripts.\n\nThe script editor in the Aurora Toolset does not allow you to search through default BioWare scripts unless you open them first. The same is true for scripts in hak paks. You can search through the module's scripts without opening them, but not other scripts. Hence the original motivation for this utility.\n\nUsing the program is fairly straight-forward. Enter the text you want to search for, then hit \"Search\". Click a script name to display the script; right-click to copy script name(s) to the clipboard. The \"find in script\" button will go to the next occurrence of the current search phrase (which you can change from the one used to locate the script). There is a check box to indicate if you want to search a hak pak instead, but you will have to select a hak pak first.\n\nOne change from Lilac Soul's functionality is that the scripts are now read-only. You can still save a script to a text file, but you cannot edit the script from within this version of BioSearcher. I think this reduces confusion (you never could save the changes back to where the script came from), and text editors -- some with syntax highlighting -- are fairly easy to come by.\n\nA few minor features:\nIf the list of scripts has the keyboard focus, SHIFT-ENTER will display the script, but leave the keyboard focus in the list. When selecting a hak pak to search, you can select a module (or .erf) instead; searching a module will search the module and all its hak paks. If BioSearcher has trouble finding NWN, try running it from the directory where nwn.exe is located.\n\nThe program is released under the GNU General Public License, which is included in the download section. The download section also includes the Lazarus (Pascal) source code for the program.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1522":{"Title":"Neverwinter Nights Multi-Instance","Author":"drake127","Submitted":20120207,"Updated":20120210,"Category":"Code Modification","Format":"Exe File","Description":"This modified nwmain.exe implements two changes to default Neverwinter Nights executable behavior on Windows.\n\nIt allows you to run two or more Neverwinter Nights instances on single PC and user account and it does no longer require administrator privileges to run.\n\nPlease note that you will still need to run Neverwinter Nights from distinct folders to avoid temporary file collisions (configuration files, current game files, logs) and it is your responsibility to ensure Neverwinter Nights has write access to its folder or that you launch it with administrator privileges manually (see Link).\n\nI recommend creating hard links and junctions of large data files and folders (see Link).","Rating":9.67,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"1523":{"Title":"Alternative Combat Soundset (ProjectQ)","Author":"Life404","Submitted":20120220,"Updated":20120223,"Category":"Other","Format":"2da","Description":"This is an override pack for alternate weapon sounds during combat. \n\nCredits go to ProjectQ for the files, however this has been pulled out of their haks and hastily put together as an override for those who want the sounds on non-ProjectQ servers. \n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE: It's currently a little klunky in terms of being a streamlined override, however I'll be sorting that out for the next update; with my own sound additions.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1524":{"Title":"NWNCX - Neverwinter Nights Client Extender (by virusman)","Author":"The Amethyst Dragon","Submitted":20120425,"Updated":20120616,"Category":"Code Modification","Format":"Exe File","Description":"The Neverwinter Nights Client Extender is a set of files that modifies the player-side game client software.

As new areas are completed, the take the place of template area place-holders.\nAllow a relatively few templates to represent hundreds or thousands of areas without hitting NwN resource limits.\n\nLet me repeat part of that in a different way. My idea here is to create a setting within which to set the gems of your creations. The regional mod will be the surrounding areas of wilderness and set here and there within it will be the destination and plot areas. It will, ideally, link across module and server. The Region is the gold, the plot mods/areas are the jewels. Together they make stop that! ...a whole greater than their parts.\n\nExample: I am writing the Forester mod now. It is set in Tieri Verd'n (The Walking Woods). The Walking Woods are not *needed* for Forester, but if you download Forester and you download Tieri Verd'n and other mods that the region links to, then you may take a break from sweet-talking the troll Matriarch to wander down toward the Vale of Tears or the forest town of Elfhaven. Then wander back and see what mischief the hedgewitch and her daughter have got up to while you've been gone. \n\nAn important part of this process will be saving, restoring and updating state info when moving between mods and servers. I lack a lot of experience, particularly with moving between servers. But I learn fast :-) And I am humble enough to accept help and give credit :-)\n\nOh, one more thing. State info will be saved by node, not area. So if someone changes something in a certain place, the change will only occur at that node, not in the area that node shares with uncounted other places. Similarly, state info will be weighted by activity. Active nodes will hold on to their state data longer, while neglected/never visited nodes will bottom out at default (unspawned/inactive).\n\nExample (planned): If a rampaging monster of the catastrophic variety hits the south end of the Walking woods and it takes a month for anyone to hear about it, it will devastate a large number of areas (nodes). These state changes will be done by scripting and should have minimal impact on performance. But when the PC gets to the area, they will find devastation! Later, when they haven't been by the site of their great triumph for a month or so, they will return to find the place sylvan once more. But it won't happen overnight or with a server reset :-P\n\nSome points:\nIt's not a 1:1 grid system. It's a *defined* topology (currently defined in the \nregnode_.2da ). The possible transitions from any given node are stored in the regnode_ definition. They can be adjusted once, there, instead of editing oodles of WPs and Triggers... This includes *vertical* links, incidently, that Cestus will be using for the dwarven citadel of Fireholt and the Underways region.\nIt's flexible in that \"template\" nodes (drawn from a pool of generic-but-classed areas) can be replaced when feasible with crafted areas without disturbing the weave of the region.\nIt's consistent in that the path and landmarks to any given area remain the same (*not* random).\nIt lends itself to a certain \"traveling\" map idea (a hybrid of DoD and Tarot's map-tiles) I have that builds a dynamic \"worldmap\" type area based on the areas (drawn from the region definition in regnode_).\nIt lends itself to the Travel Builder system of assigning travel times and encounter probabilities between nodes.\n It lends itself to \"shortcuts\"... when you reach an area edge you have a choice of transitioning directly to the next node or calling up the traveling map of the region and jumping (with appropriate travel times) to any node you've already travelled.\n\nRelease roadmap:\nTravel:\nInter-module transitions working\nInter-server transitions working\nTravel times and multi-level regions\n---\nEcology:\nBiomass interactions & resource harvesting systems working\nCreature migration & territorial behavior.\nDM tools\n---\nMaps:\nMap directives and miniatures working\nMulti-level, fluid mapping (3D layers)\n\n\nUpdates:\n2012-12-05: Initial upload v1.0 to this project\n2012-12-02: v1.0 contributed to 2012-11 CCC: Sea, Air, Land Travel\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1540":{"Title":"Neverwinter Nights Server Browser","Author":"Baaleos","Submitted":20121208,"Updated":20121208,"Category":"Application","Format":"Other","Description":"Because the master server is now gone, I've decided to have a go at making a C# Application that makes it easy to browse servers, and jump into them from Windows.\n\nThis application requires .Net 4 to run,\nIt requires that NWN is installed correctly - it tries to read Registry Settings to get the NWN Directory.\nAnd it also alters memory locations in NWN to bypass the MasterServer authentication timeout.\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1541":{"Title":"NWNCore Mastering Service","Author":"Visavant","Submitted":20121208,"Updated":20121209,"Category":"Application","Format":"Exe File","Forums":"Link","Description":"Simple application to patch Windows nwmain.exe and nwserver.exe applications to use the NWNCore mastering / matchmaking service.\n\nIt requires .NET 4 framework available here: Link\n\nIf you have any inquiries, please visit : Link","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"1543":{"Title":"NWNX Minipatch","Author":"Terrah","Submitted":20130328,"Updated":20130412,"Category":"Application","Format":"Exe File","Forums":"Link","Description":"A small nwnx plugin which removes the cap on weapon color parts using CopyItemAndModify.
