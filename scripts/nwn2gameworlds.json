The DM has over 25 years of experience DMing in the Greyhawk setting.\n\nThis is a campaign for those who are trying to get away from the \"this is a computer game and I run around killing things all day with my two +13 swords\" type of game and is more of a \"this is a developing story that my character is an integral part of\" approach. No apologies made as this is an ongoing campaign where story and character advancement is more important than being a \"1337 d00d\".\n\nThis campaign will be conducted in the manner and style of old 1st edition games and will be a fully DMed affair. This means every NPC is DM controlled, leading to a more immersive gaming experience and a decidedly slower overall pace as well.\n\nIn addition, every creature/monster/NPC in this campaign will be hand placed. This means maximum variety in the look and feel of your adventure. Each module will employ DM awarded lump sum XP rewards at its conclusion, with the projected range being communicated in advance.\n\nIn constructing the module, I am making heavy use of pre-fab areas and other files uploaded to NWVault. Although in many cases, I�ll end up spending a considerable amount of time modifying and adding ambience to these areas to achieve the feel I want, I�d like to take the opportunity here to thank the content creators and people who have made their hard work available to the community at large.\n\nPlayers will have to download the character generation mini-module, as well as the other files below, including the PWC file for the particular module that is currently being played.\n\nGames will be scheduled on the NWC site, with adventures designed for 4 � 5 PCs, with general class breakout as follows; 2 fighters, 1 wizard, 1 rogue and one cleric. Note that alternative classes can substitute for the general list (i.e. a barbarian instead of a fighter, or a sorcerer instead of a wizard). Adventuring parties are welcome to deviate from this skill mix, but be advised that each module will be designed with the �classic� group in mind.\n\nProjected level range of the campaign will be 1st to 10th.\n\nAdventure Modules in the Series:\nGHA2.0 � Into Loren�s Ford (currently in play with 6 � 8 hours of gameplay (3 � 4 game sessions).

This is the Age of Dragons.\n\nDragons control the world. The nations that humans and elves will create do not exist yet, the lands instead ruled by oppressive dragons bent on enslaving the lesser races and by benevolent philosopher-kings dedicated to giving the non-dragons of the world safety and peace. Dragons share the control of the world, dividing it up into regions called suzerains, although they never truly agree on borders and territory. The good dragons vie for control using diplomacy and trade, while evil dragons at times wage all-out war on other suzerains and lesser territories, trying to subjugate or annihilate those who resist their cruel wishes.\n\nNon-dragons are only beginning to rise from barbarism. Many of the races that will in time become dominant in the world have just begun to feel their abilities and potential grow. Humankind is the most barbaric, still in the throes of a violent and destructive nature. Elves and dwarves have begun to develop some technology, but items commonplace in the future are the exception, not the norm. Metal weapons and armor are somewhat rare, and the intricacies of magic are still being discovered and developed by non-dragons. Coins as currency do not exist, with small gems being used in place of barter in some places, and bars of gold and silver the norm for large transactions. Sailing ships are still in their infancy and never seen in groups, and land-based transport such as carts and wagons are only for the wealthy and the powerful. Survival is the most important thing on the minds of the common folk, be it the slaves of an oppressive red dragon or the citizens of a forest controlled by a benevolent silver dragon.\n\nMagic is fantastic and uncommon. Even though dragons wield great magics and command the forces of the arcane, the secrets of the arcanum are just that � secrets, wielded by few non-dragons, save the most studious, pious, or commanding of the lesser races. The magic shops and wizard schools of the original Talernon setting do not exist, and rituals are a valued and coveted commodity. Most common folk might only see magic a few times in their life, save when wielded by dragons or their servants, the dragonborn. Miracles of magic sometimes are found in the most dedicated of the servants of the gods, but even these actions are considerably rarer than in the original Talernon campaign, with a village healer wielding considerable influence and a wizard in a remote tower the subject of rumor and fear.\n\nThe planar structure of the multiverse is undeveloped. Unlike the original Talernon setting, the cosmos has a very different structure. The Inner Planes are a still a rolling mixture called the Elemental Chaos, and the Outer Planes have not drifted into their respective positions determined alignments and ethos, instead floating in the Astral Sea. The Plane of Wood has considerable importance, known in this era as the Feywild. This is taken from 4th edition rules for DnD.\n\nLey-lines cross the land, and have been since the beginning of time. In the years after the original Talernon campaign setting, the Coming of the Lines signaled the return of ley-lines to the world, having been absent for many millennia. In the Age of Dragons, they have been for all time, a part of the world connecting places and magical power in kind.\n\nTalernon 3 includes:\n\n- NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD FILES HERE - log in and the new autodownloader gives you everything from haks to music!\n\n- Playable Dragonborn (from 4e), lizardmen, pixies, and ogres � dynamic races that can wear new outfits and have different faces \n\n- 17 additional PRCs, including Kaedrins classes \n\n- Over 150 additional new spells and 40 additional new feats \n\n- Extensive Great Magic system, with over 15 new Epic Spells \n\n- Custom summoning spells, which allow you to choose an element or focus, or alignment-based summoning (air, earth, water, fire, negative, ice, magma, artifice, magic, nature, and more)\n\n- 10 new skills, taken from 4e, all used in RP as well as quests \n\n- Kemo�s custom animations\n\n- Insane amounts of custom content from the Vault\n\n- IG Appearance Crafting � create custom armor and weapons IG, don�t look like a clown!\n\n- Over 3000 custom monsters to battle, and over 1000 custom magical items to find\n\n- Random loot spawns � never find loot in the same place twice\n\n- Extensive Crafting � normal NWN2 crafting, plus additional masterwork item and magical item systems\n\n- A complex and growing persistent quest system � every NPC learns to know you, and you have a reputation with each one\n\n- Crazy DM tools designed for the sole purpose of entertaining players\n\nWant to be a part of the fun?\n\nCurrent Patch: 1.23 final \nCurrent Status: Live","Rating":9.77,"Votes":67,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"9":{"Name":"Twilight Legacy","Author":"TL Admin","Submitted":20060925,"Updated":20061005,"Category":"In Development","Website":"Link","Setting":"The custom world of Cyrendell: many nations and factions vie for resources in a land rich in beauty and intregue. \n\nWell established history of the world and people found on the website.","Alignments":"All","LevelRange":"1 - 20","NumberDMS":"11","House Rules":"Please refrain from shouting or OOC in talk.

Dasaria is a collaborative gameworld adapted from a long-running pen-and-paper campaign, driven from the creativity of our Storyline DMs and players alike. Dasaria is also a story, in which players have had a hand in writing the chapters FOR MORE THAN A DECADE!\n\nDasaria 2 is fully autodownloader-enabled, and players can simply join our server to get in on the action. Players can locate our game world under GameSpy�s Roleplay category or direct-connect to dasaria.dyndns-server.com\n\nDasaria is aimed at mature players of all ages. We expect our players to act as stewards of the gameworld and their fellow players, especially if their characters are in opposition.\nWe provide an environment where roleplay and in-character realism are encouraged. There is however, plenty of action to be had.\nDasaria is a medium-magic world, in which plain steel in capable hands can still shape the destiny of an Empire.\nWe are a full PvP server for roleplay and realism opportunities. The ONLY excuse for PvP is a legitimate roleplayed conflict.\nDasaria uses the Hardcore difficulty setting; Monsters do full damage and careless actions can harm your allies. Combat can be difficult for some characters and many dungeons are not intended to be soloed.\nDasaria has an experience cap of 191,500. As such, ECL races cannot reach level 20.\nThere is an experience and gold loss penalty for utilizing the respawner. There is no level loss or negative experience, except at level 20.\nYou do not need any of NWN2's expansions to play on Dasaria. We support all client versions of the game simultaneously\nThe Administrators of Dasaria take a very dim view towards ill-behaved persons (cheaters, griefers, player or NPC-killers, out-of-character pickpockets, rapists, etc)\nYou begin your journey at level one with no gold or possessions, only your wits, and limitless adventure before you\nDasaria includes persistent player housing with the ability to purchase furniture and items which which to decorate your own home.\nDasaria features a custom faction and renown system and overland map battlefield areas through which high-level characters can directly influence the course of the war through a 'game-within-the-game' that also provides non-epic progression opportunities even after PCs have reached level 20.\n\nOur campaign begins fifty years after the �good guys� lost. Characters begin their journey in the bustling port city of Cear, on the far reaches of the lands now occupied by the powerful and oppressive Varanite Empire. Most of the vestiges of the Old Kingdom are all but forgotten now -- or driven underground. But all is not well in this Empire of Red and Gold. While the land's new masters grew complacent, a long-forgotten threat was stirring in the darkness, plotting its revenge. Now its fury is released on the lands, caring not for political or religious ideals.\n\nWith an entirely original milieu, independent of thoroughly-explored properties such as Forgotten Realms, players have an unprecedented opportunity to participate in shaping the world and the campaign in Dasaria. The Dasaria DM team has always been a strong advocate of the player and his/her ability to influence the world, letting the characters themselves shape their destinies within the framework of the campaign, and this is echoed in the work of the world's builders. The development team too has always encouraged and fostered the creative ability of its players, creating content to appropriately react to developments in the game world, and in working with and integrating player-submitted-content.\n\nHomepage: Link\nDiscussion Forum: Link\nServer Rules: Link\nGetting Started: Link\nDasaria 2 Campaign Background: Link\nDasaria 2 Gameworld Wiki: Link\n\nCheck out our Player Housing System!

In the three thousand years since whatever cataclysmic event destroyed the Second Age � a time period whose knowledge is all but lost � the various sentient races have built nations and civilizations. It is a time of peace and prosperity. \n\nAlas, though peace reigns over much of The Known Lands, it is not a time of tranquility. In the past fifty years, The Known Lands has been shocked with the realization that below their islands exists a subterranean world at least as large as their own � the Underdark. Twice from this Underdark have come forth a hitherto unknown race� the drow. Two massive attacks by the drow have all but destroyed the citadel homelands of the dwarves, leaving that once-proud race decimated and beaten. The last was but a score of years ago.... \n\nNow the Known Lands struggles with the repercussions of a dwarven-created plague gone awry, the 'Culling' of the halflings in their own land, and strange and unknown forces that have brought new challenges to the peoples of the world. Many strange and unique societies and organizations have sprung up, from the shadowy to the enlightened. Many parts of The Known Lands remain unexplored, though legends of wild barbarian elves and halflings, strange draconic followers, people who sail the endless oceans, never stepping off their ships, all abound in taverns and marketplaces of The Known Lands. What new heroes will arise to explore and discover the truth to these tales?\n\n-The Known Lands Game Setup \n\nThe Known Lands is a 'home grown' world that has been developed around the PW structure. Our ultimate goal with this project is to make a PW that is roleplay (RP) focused with the feel of a �pen and paper� (PnP) game. In order to get that PnP feel, we have added a feature that is the most similar to traditional PnP. This is the use of adventuring parties in the world (described below). \n\n-Adventuring Parties \nThe way these work is: \n\n-When you apply to play in the Known Lands, you have the option to request joining a party. If you decide to do this, you will give us some times that you can make on a weekly basis. We will match these times to existing groups that needs PCs to find a party for you. \n\n-Each party is employed by a DM run NPC. Your new PC will be hired and added to the party. \n\n-Every week, parties meet for a DM run session, usually taking about 3 hours. Each party will have one DM who will run plots for this group. Picture this like a regular, weekly PnP session. \n\n-These parties are where the most important, world altering activities occur. Expect many long, running plotlines to be run for the parties. In the 1.5 years that this server is running, adventuring parties have helped with the birth of a new god, the ruin of a nation, and many other events of epic proportions.\n\nAside from the adventuring parties - as a PW that is up 24-7 we have a great many automated quests for you to enjoy whenever you log on. We are proud to say we have many highly experienced and talented builders and coders that have made a variety of quests to suit and challenge characters. To add further fun challenges as well as a greater degree of the unexpected, we have a quality staff of creative DMs who run events when they are on.\n\nAt the moment we have nine adventuring parties active in the world, consisting of 5-8 players each. We hope to add a tenth one soon. A list of available parties can be found at the link mentioned above.\n","Rating":9.87,"Votes":67,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"26":{"Name":"Blackengorge","Author":"Loxodonta","Submitted":20061013,"Updated":20061013,"Category":"Roleplaying","Website":"Link","Number Players":"32","Death Type":"Custom death and respawn with xp penalty.","Length":"Persistent World","Setting":"Custom setting based on Forgotten Realms terminology.","Alignments":"All","Races":"All","Classes":"All","LevelRange":"All","NumberServers":"1","Schedule":"DM Events scheduled and announced in advance through the forum.","IPs":"tbc","NumberDMS":"3","Application Reqs":"Join the forum.","Language":"English","Scope":"Small","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"Multiple DMs required","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Treasure":"Dependant on Players efforts","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Players efforts","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Mixed","Connection":"DSL","Content Rating":"Everyone","NumberAreas":"30-50","Description":"The Blackengorge Neverwinter Nights 2 server will be a persistent world with emphasis on role-playing.

It has drawn adventurers, willing to risk their lives in an effort to re-civilise the lands and to find the lost riches and splendour of the old world.\n\nEvents led by DMs will follow story arcs, perhaps even running over several events.

Take a look at Link for a writeup of our PW history.\n\nWe are Action/RP Lite based, slower leveling, with medium magic and economy. Please check out our website at Link our Builder's Forum at Link and our Player's Forum at Link\n\nWe are always interested in having other people join up and help out on the Build Staff. If you are one of those people that wants to give us a hand, please let me now how you wish to help out. We have a totally seperate forum that players will use, the Builder's one is mainly for development and you can only join with an Admin's acceptance here. We will be taking only those people who feel they can become relatively dedicated to the project, meet deadlines and won't leave us hanging.\n\nWe are looking for people to help out in the following areas:\n\nScript Writers - Responsible for the creation and implementation of script/code into the game. Note that we use some pretty advanced scripting here (or more specifically, Ima Dufus, our Lead Scripter does), so please be sure you have an idea what you are doing before you apply. \n\nWriters - Responsible for writing quests and other plotlines. \n\nBuilders - Responsible for creating Areas, NPCs, Items and Creatures using the game's Toolset. We are in the area production design stage currently.\n\nDungeon Masters - Responsible for common DM related things. It is also the duties of the DMs to actively go out and recruit new players and then help them to adjust and feel at home here on our server. No applications being accepted at this time, however, we are having prospective DMs create static quests right now.\n\n************************************************************\n\nHistory of the World\n\nIn the beginning there was Gayatria the water mother and Varuna the sky god. They bore many children, among them the mighty Titans and the giant misshapen Hecantonchiera. Fearful of being usurped, Varuna imprisoned his children in the womb of his wife, until Cronos, youngest and most powerful of the Titans, took up an adamantium sickle and slew his father as he embraced Gayatria. The sky god fell forever upon his wife, the Great Ocean, to form the lands of Mu, upon which his children were freed. \n\nAt first Mu was a barren landscape, empty and forsaken where the Titans walked alone. To amuse themselves they partook in mutual dream-plays, until they got bored with even this. So they reached into their fathers flesh and took up clay, shaping it into the form of the first men, and breathing life into it with their wondrous powers. These primitive creations became the playthings of the titans, amusing them with their free will. But then Cronos had a dream-vision, in which the sons of their creations arose against the Titans and imprisoned them once more in Agartha. He forbade the creation of any more mortals, but Prometheus defied him and took more of his fathers flesh to create true man in all its forms - the humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings. He built upon the island of Azlurhath a mighty city to house his creations, which he watched over and protected from the wrath of Cronos. \n\nFor untold centuries true man resided in Atlantis, creating law and the arts, and all aspects of civilization, while around them the Titans and their chaotic brothers, the Hecantonchiera, roamed the land following their unfathomable schemes. During all this time Cronos watched and waited for a chance to destroy Prometheus' creations, still fearful of the prophecy. When Prometheus stole fire from one of Varunas still-weeping wounds and gave it to man against his law, Cronos convened the Titans to pass judgment upon his unfaithful brother. Prometheus was bound upon the slopes of Mount Voormithadreth to suffer eternal torment. \n\nCronos then turned his wrath upon the true men, but Prometheus had foreseen these events and had commanded his brother Epimetheus to protect his charges. As the angry Cronos raised his mighty arm to slay the champions of man, Epimetheus appeared before them and wrestled the king of the Titans. Furious at his disobedience, the short-tempered Cronos drew his adamantium sickle and fatally wounded his rebellious brother. Suddenly horrified by his actions, Cronos fled, leaving the dying Epimetheus among the mortal champions. With his dying breath Epimetheus cursed his brother and all his kind by sharing the forbidden knowledge of the Titans with the mortal champions. As his final act he passed onto them his immortal essence, commanding them to defend their people. \n\nArmed with the sacred knowledge from Epimetheus the nine brave mortals took into themselves the divine spark, to defend true man from the Titans. At first the battle raged terribly upon the face of Mu, with much destruction in its path. So terrible were the magics of the Titans that even in his death Varuna shuddered, raising new mountains where there had been none, and sinking great lands into the sea. The peoples of the world were torn asunder, their shattered towns left burning in the wake of Cronos and his army of fiends. \n\nDriven back to the very shores of Atlantis, here the nine Lightbringers braced themselves for a last stand against the abominable monstrous creations that the Titans formed from the earth and threw against their walls. Sensing defeat looming, the Lightbringers, in desperation, abandoned the city and entered the dream-plane of the Titans. Here they engaged the Titans in their own fantasies, waging war on them in the spirit plane above the mundane world. Their desperate ploy had worked - with the full attention of the Titans on the spirit plane the attack on Atlantis ceased, the monsters retreating into the wilds. This battle of wills raged for centuries above the world of man, while below those left behind found themselves in a new world suddenly devoid of all guidance and law. With the divine protection of the Lightbringers gone, mankind found itself in a truly dark age. \n\nThe handful of survivors were cast into a primitive state of being. The few that remained gathered in the safety of the city Atlantis, and before long unrest started to spread amongst them, and one by one the different races started leaving. Fights often broke out, and it wasn't long before there were mainly humans left in the city. When the victorious gods returned from their spirit war centuries later they saw the state the world was in. Unable to agree on a common plan, they went their separate ways in an attempt to achieve what they each saw as perfection, seeking to rebuild the world in their own image. \n\nMolhern, God of Knowledge came forth to Atlantis, and under the guise of a wise man he introduced writing to the savages. He gave them fire, and taught them to pen animals and cultivate the land. Suddenly records were kept. The sages, as they call themselves, started developing methods of time keeping. Meanwhile with Zeron the Guardian restored, order fell once more upon the city, and the last of the warlords was displaced, allowing a newly formed Senate to gain control of the city. So was the Republic of Atlantis formed, and an organized democratic government finally created. About fifty years after the creation of the Senate the first calendar is introduced, and the year zero is placed at the birth of the Republic. \n\nOver the next two hundred years Atlantis' population blooms, and there is a need to expand out of the city. Expedition forces are sent forth, and soon land is converted to farmland, and cantons are established left and right of the city. It is during this boom that many worshippers of Kotan follow the God's instructions and leave the city in a mass exodus. The people who are left behind don't know where they went, and few dared to follow them into the wilderness, their image forever erased from the world's memories. In time Atlantis enters a golden age, and expands continually for the next four hundred years, establishing cantons when the need arises. As Atlantis expands further, more cantons are established around it. The expansions to the West are brought to a halt because of the large Shalishul Forest, a dark and foreboding place. \n\nIn the year 666 the high-priest of Chun and high-priestess of Charista leave the city with a gathering of men and women in a south-west direction, following the Cronos River. Near the end of this century strange things start happening, with people doing inexplicable feats. Lightning storms during frustrating dreams, sudden explosions that set buildings on fire, floods in the wrong season... Soon people become adept at manipulating these strange events. The first users of Arcane Magic start traveling the land, and soon afterwards people start studying the art, even though it is considered rather dark and evil by some. \n\nIn the year 775, with more expansion in mind, scouts are sent east to explore the region and return with tales of a flourishing city at the edge of the sea. Even though diplomatic relations are initiated, it isn't long before they deteriorate and a full scale war is declared in the year 820 between the two city-states of Atlantis and newly discovered Athenu. \n\nDue to heavy demands in iron from the war the mining town of Peladon is established in the Spine of Varuna, and when the mining complex runs into the dwarven kingdom of Urm deep within Agartha, diplomatic relations with the dwarves are established. The Atlanteans turn to the dwarves for supplies in ores and worked goods, which they receive. Thirty years later a group of elves appears out of Shalishul Forest and is warily accepted by the military at Fort Nadras. Ambassadors are exchanged with the elven nation of Ideluna, and a formal alliance is agreed upon. The elves send over a token force to the war front near Athenu, whose small size irks the rule of Atlantis. With no hope of ending the war in sight, the Senate starts to withdraw resources from the war effort, and starts looking for ways of expanding northward, past the sea. To many commoners it starts to seem like Atlantis lost the war, and unrest starts to increase. \n\nThe war had simmered down, but when an Athenian offensive razes a small village on the border with Atlantis, the Republic, with tremendous backing of the public, builds the largest army ever seen. This army is lead by General Hashaar Shune. Hashaar besieges the city, and bloodily conquers it in the year 950. Seizing opportunity Hashaar marches back to Atlantis in triumph end overthrows the Senate. He forms the Shunik Empire. \n\nWhen in 957, Ideluna is invaded by snake like creatures, the elves turn to Hashaar for aid, but he is unwilling to help them, reminding them of the miniature force they had sent during the war with Athenu, as well as the fact that their alliance was with the Old Republic, not the new Empire. Hashaar agrees to help the elven Queen if Ideluna forfeits its independence and becomes a province of the Shunik Empire. When the queen reluctantly agrees, troops are sent to the kingdom, and the invaders are quickly repelled. \n\nIn 974 Hashaar dies of old age, and is followed by his son, Dariush. However, Dariush isn't as liked as his father was, and public unrest spreads, not only amongst the elves, but also amongst the humans. In 996 rebels begin to emerge around Athenu, and the Imperial Army is hard pressed to maintain the peace, although they manage for the moment. \n\nWith the coming turn of the millennium, doom-day cultists are starting to speak of Ramarah, the prophesied \"end of the world,\" in which the Titans will return and fight both god and mankind alike, in the process destroying Azlurhath and all who live upon it. With the land on the brink of civil war, the planet has become a world of brother against brother. It is a world of broken dreams and crushed desires. It is a world of Shattered Souls... \n","Rating":10,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"29":{"Name":"Lord of the Rings: Shadow's Twilight","Author":"James C. & Various","Submitted":20061016,"Updated":20061016,"Category":"Roleplaying","Number Players":"64","Death Type":"Varies with level.

We also used the DMFI and Heed's PC Tools HAKS, both can be found on the NWVault.","Death":"Yup","House Rules":"Features \n\n� Lands of Algia � Warhammer is a mid level magic world, meaning that +2 weapons are usual with +3 weapons being hot finds, +4 weapons are attainable but extremely rare/mythical. The same goes for permanent stat boosting items. Items that grant permanent haste and immunity are non-existent. \n\n� Quests; Lands of Algia - Warhammer is very quest rich with approximately 40 quests already scripted for your enjoyment. These range from simple starting quests in town through to long engaged quests taking several hours to complete. Room is made in the quests for good and evil, lawful and chaotic. Actions in quests effect the way townsfolk may treat you in the future. Don�t get too well known as a criminal or you will find yourself shunned. \n\n� In this type of world you tend to find that spell casters dominate other classes, with that in mind we have implemented an altered spell casting system that requires a caster to buy generic components to ensure they do not dominate other classes. Balanced with the player base, supply and demand will ensure that every other character is not a caster. Wizards will also have to learn that they are very weak alone at low levels. \n\n� Quest token rewards. Longevity is important. A common fault of PWs is that eventually the player base learns that this monster has the best sword and that the best shield. Everyone ends up the same. When you complete quests you get tokens, these can be traded with treasure givers that provide you a random item from a set of treasure pools. Do you want a weapon for a dexterity based character or a miscellaneous item for a caster? This means 10 people doing the same quests will not end up with the same set of items. \n\n� Custom XP scripts. XP is designed so that up to 4 characters can party before there are any penalties promoting party play without penalizing soloists. XP for killing monsters degrades over time from relatively generous rewards to much lower amounts once you have killed a few dozen of the same thing making those farming grinds pointless. This is compensated by comparatively more generous quest rewards. \n\n� LAW is a roleplaying world, however we are not the 'RP enforcement police' in that we do not expect everyone to RP to our predetermined specifications, that said we do expect players to be civil to each other out of character so if you are uncomfortable with someone else�s roleplay which you are involved with then send them an OOC 'tell' explaining the fact. This leads on to... \n\n� CvC: Player vs Player is not permitted, this means that for instance if you as a player take a dislike to another player, you do not take it out on them through your characters. However this is Warhammer so Character vs Character is acceptable, provided that there is a reason for the conflict but please remember that conflict does not always have to be resolved with violence, you could use persuasion/successful intimidation etc. And remember if an NPC sees you commit a crime you may end up with the city guard on you. \n\n� Role-playing reward systems. There are 2 built in reward systems. First, DMs give reward �cookies� for roleplaying and adding to the server. These are player rewards and can be traded for special gifts and awards to further develop engagement with your favorite characters. Secondly there is DMXP this is a system where DMs can reward general RP. The effect of DMXP is to adjust the rewards from kills and the penalties from dieing. DMXP is persistent and effects your whole character life in game. \n\n� Character death has no penalties below 4th level; you do not lose XP or gold when you respawn so explore the world while it�s still painless. From 5th level onwards there is an escalating XP loss and a static 50% gold loss when you respawn, this is to represent the cost of raise dead/resurrection via various temples, locating the body etc. \n\n� Heed�s Tools and DMFI implemented to further enhance the roleplaying experience. These tools together are particularly useful in supporting DM events where those PnP like rolls make all the difference. \n\n� Progression up to about 4th or 5th is quite quick after that it slows down. Non ECL characters can immediately gain 3rd level. \n\n� All characters have unlimited respawns with the following exceptions:- Certain areas that contain much better treasure (amongst other reasons) will be classed as mortal combat zones where if you choose to respawn you will permanently lose one of your 9 lives, once all these lives are gone you are permanently dead. Any such areas will be marked as such. Some DM quests will have this classification and as such any players will be notified beforehand. Raise dead and resurrection by another character is unaffected by this rule. Where players or factions have roleplaying reasons for conflict then a DM moderated event can allow the loser to lose a life token. This way duels and assassinations played out well CAN mean something. In the present Algia build there are only 2 dungeons that are mortal and one of those is the criminal punishment �pit�. Don�t get caught! \n\n� There are no restrictions on classes or races in Algia. However if you walk into an Empire town as a Dark Elf (Chaosborn) don�t be surprised when all the guards come charging at you. Thus, in Algia the result is the ECL races are weaker than the non ECL races. People should play these for RP reasons and not for advantage. We don�t want a server where you never see a human. \n\n","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Tricks Traps":"Light","RolePlay":"Medium","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Moderate","Experience Rewards":"Moderate","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"10 Mbps","Content Rating":"Teen","NumberAreas":"50-100","Description":"Every new beginning comes from some other beginning�s end. � Semisonic, Closing Time\n\nIt�s true.

Use common sense.\n\n� Don't grief other players. Griefing is defined as intentionally ruining the experience of another player. This includes, but is not limited to, verbal and physical harassment.\n\n� Don't exploit module bugs. While you are not obligated to report them, you are obligated to not take advantage of them.\n\n� Don't converse with others in the shout channel. Only use it when you need to address everyone on the server.\n\n� Killing other players is permitted; however you should have a valid reason for doing so. Valid reasons need not be role-played, but take it easy. After you've \nkilled your enemy a few times move on--constantly stalking another player will be considered griefing. Valid reasons do not include slaughtering lower level \ncharacters for one's enjoyment. If you act like a homicidal maniac you will be treated like one and be incarcerated or executed (or both).","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Light","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Moderate","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Party PvP","Connection":"T1","Content Rating":"Teen","NumberAreas":"100-500","Description":"World of Amar is a NWN2 persistent world set in the Forgotten Realms that seeks to further realize the vision of the creator's NWN1 PW entitled simply \"The Underdark.\" That vision is, in part, to break away from the increasingly roleplaying-focused NWN community mindset and create an innovative module that provides plenty of rapid fire combat fun without degenerating into a monotonous XP grind. \n\nWhile maintaining a healthy level of dragon slaying and zombie hunting, we believe that plot, dialogue, and a robust back-story are central to the success of any NWN PW. Players' progression in the World of Amar will thus be driven by quests, conversations with NPCs, and the occasional puzzle. Every area will have a purpose--there will be no filler material.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nServer website: http://amar.counterfeitculture.com\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nOur design philosophy centers around three principles:\n\n(1) Neverwinter Nights is, above all, a multiplayer game.\n\nThe designers subscribe to the idea that NWN is all about having a good time playing a game with like-minded gamers. To that end, the module is an exercise in creating a PW that closely resembles existing MMORPGs, striking a balance between pure action and social aspects. Emphasis is placed on group \nplay; most areas will be too difficult to handle without the assistance of your peers. In order to compensate for the recognized difficulties of finding and forming a group, experience is never split amongst members--instead, everyone gets a full portion in addition to a small bonus corresponding to the size of your group. The idea is to eliminate all excuses (outside of personal preference) for rejecting the invitation to play with one's peers.\n\n(2) Players have the right to decide how they will enjoy the game.\n\nWe also strongly believe that people should be able to play this game (and any game) in whatever manner provides them the most enjoyment. Consequently, all alignments and playing styles are welcome here as long as players respect others' rights to enjoy NWN2 to a reasonable degree. Via the same reasoning, role-playing is not mandatory. Our goal is to provide a top-quality server where anyone and everyone can join up and play with minimal restrictions and without a lengthy and elitist application process. This is a server for all players.\n\n(3) It is vital for the player community to be actively involved in module development.\n\nA server is nothing without its players. We value and respect our player base and not only hope for but expect them to help effect change. That is not to say we require players to write code! All it means is that every player is not only given the chance to put forth suggestions that will be taken seriously, but that they may also contribute more directly by creating items, NPCs, writing plot, or even designing entire areas and quests. In our NWN1 PW, The Underdark, there existed literally hundreds of player-submitted items and dozens of player-designed areas. We hope to continue this practice with World of Amar.\n \n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThe difficulty of encounters in World of Amar is high and the majority of content is designed to be experienced as a group, but don't be discouraged! Penalties for respawning are low and are only incurred for players level 5 and above. Furthermore, that penalty is small relative to most other servers, consisting of minor (but not trivial) gold and XP losses (no item loss or permadeath).\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nExperience rates for combat in World of Amar are low in order to make leveling your character feel like a real acheivement instead of a race that you can plow through in a couple of days. While combat is a major focus of the module, much of the experience that players earn will also come from intricate quests and missions.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nNote: \n\n*World of Amar is not live as of yet (Nov. 17, 2006), but will be in the near future. Stay tuned!\n\n*Number of areas reflects the planned size of the module, not the current content.","Rating":9.67,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"60":{"Name":"Noreshia","Author":"TheTormented","Submitted":20061117,"Updated":20061117,"Category":"In Development","Website":"www.noreshia.com","Setting":"Custom","Alignments":"All","Races":"Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, Half-Orc, Half Elf","Classes":"Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard ","LevelRange":"1-20","Application Reqs":"None","Language":"English","Scope":"Medium","Tricks Traps":"Dependant on Module","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Treasure":"Dependant on Players efforts","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Module","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"DSL","Content Rating":"Teen","NumberAreas":"30-50","Description":"A world and time where mighty dragons rule the skies and massive battles besiege the land below.

Dwarves, humans, elves, halflings, gnomes all live in harmony, producing some of the most skilled people in the world. Beauty in every direction, magical powers more advanced than any other empire, technology at its finest, this is what you would find amongst the cities of the great empire.\n\nUnfortunately... this is what was, not is.\n\nIn the year 1251ED (Empire Date), on the anniversery of the 1251'th year of the empires power, a long ago quenched force... awakened.\n\nThrand, the dark shadow of the west, the former emperor of the empire of Kline, a dark necromancer long ago crushed beneath the powerful magicks of the blue mages of the 1st circle... awakened. Long long ago, a millenium or more, the 15 powerful sorcerors who threw Thrand and his acolytes down from the highest peaks of the mountain Hernde, were unable to banish Thrands soul from the world. So powerful was Thrands dark magic, he, a human, had lived for 400 years. Once Thrand knew the 1st circle was hunting him, he, over 1 year, siphoned his life force into 15 powerful crystals, and sent his acolytes around his empire, scattering them hidden in deep crypts full of necromantic undead.\n\nJust after sending his last crystal away, the sorcerors blew down his castle on the high peaks, their powerful magic shattering the tip of the mountain completely...\nThrand was too powerful for that however...\nCalling on his 5 most powerful necromancers, he summoned a dark demon, who in a blink of an eye sacroficed it's life for the Dark Lord, and with the demons lifeforce Thrand created a magical shield barrier that kept him and his necromancers safe from the destructive blue mages magic.\n\nOnce the pieces of the castle finally stopped falling, the mages stepped into the ruins of the castle, only to be dropped upon by hundreds of skeletons. 1 of the sorcerors was brought down, and in his death throes his magicks tore apart the skeleton force, leaving a shattered army. The remaining mages easily slaughtered the remains, and walked forward once more.\n\nAt the highest peak, they came across the darklord and his 5 minions.\n\nAll that is known from that battle are reports from ranger scouts who saw the battle.\n\n\"Black clouds swarmed and flashed with lightning, with one clear blue light shining through onto 14 visible people. Blue light flashed, only to be countered by red and black. One of the 14 fell, quickly followed by two more. The largest of the 11 remaining threw up his hands and roared incantations. With his entire body glowing bright blue, he threw himself at the 6 necromancers, enduring death hit after death hit. Finally one breached the shield, and the mage kneeled over. His body suddenly exploded with blue light, killing instantly 5 of the necromancers. After the light cleared however, one, a giant of a man, was seen still standing, his staff extended with black light pouring from its top, creating a shield of pure magic. Over a period of 3 days the remaining of the mages constantly poured magicks into the shield, with seemingly no effect. However, on the eve of the 4th day, the black cloud shattered in the face of hundreds of missiles of pure magic, and beyond it the dark lord was plummeted with enough magic to kill an army of thousands.\n\nBut he still stood....\n\nRoaring, the dark lord threw his staff like a javelin, and halfway to its target it exploded in black darkness, covering the 11 mages. When the darkness cleared, only 3 mages remained standing, the others skeletons swayed and dropped to the ground. The 3 mages simply lifted their staffs and muttered a constant flow of words, which combined into a threatening roar of magic. A blue light formed in the center of their triangle, and grew until it covered all of them� before shooting upwards 500feet in a pillar of power that crushed down onto the necromancer. When the light cleared� the necromancer�s body swayed and dropped. The mages stepped forward and gathered the body, and hurried from the mountaintop.�\n\n\n\nNothing more is known on that encounter, except for the dieing whisper from the last mage at his deathbed to his heir and apprentice that the necromancers soul remained.\n\n\n\n\nOver 100 years later, a new empire appeared in the old empires place� Anderlan. Over a period of 1200 years the empire spread, through war and conquest, trade and alliances, before becoming the greatest empire ever seen. For 51 years piece reigned, and new alliances were forged� as were hatreds.\n\nOn the 51st year of the peace� the dark power that had been stirring finally took picture, in the form of a lich riding at the head of thousands upon hundreds of thousands up MILLIONS of undead, duergar, and lizardfolk. The massive army fell upon the sleeping nation, and within a month the empire was in ruins, the Emperor�s army shattered and broken, the races forming the nation broken and split up.\n\nThis is the time in which hero�s are made, legends formed, myths spoken and new powers arising.\n\nThis, is the time of the Illusion.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"65":{"Name":"Nexus City Between Worlds 2","Author":"Aristance & Eyrelle","Submitted":20061126,"Updated":20070306,"Category":"Roleplaying","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"1-30","Length":"PW","Setting":"Custom","Alignments":"No evil PCs without permission.","Races":"All available, plus custom appearance for PC pixie/sylph, kobold, and lizardman.","Classes":"All non-evil.","LevelRange":"1-20","NumberServers":"1","NumberDMS":"2","Language":"English","Scope":"Small","Tricks Traps":"Light","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Treasure":"Low","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Mixed","Connection":"Cable","Content Rating":"Everyone","NumberAreas":"10-30","Description":"Nexus the City Between Worlds is a story-based roleplay server.

All the peoples of the sun prepared to decide the fate of our world. When black licked the defenses of our world they came. Waves upon waves, breaking against the forces of light. We battled for time imortal. The darkenedf field deceptive in time denied us the hope of day or even the rest of night. And so we fought. Blood of man joined that of all as the Dark Ones relentless assault continued. All was done none were spared....

Being a member of an adventuring group with your own personal DM, you will play through regular sessions with DM attention guaranteed.\n\nIf you find yourself playing beyond the regularly scheduled sessions, you can interact with other players in an immersive, polished world, experience sophisticated AI reacting to the in-game events and live your own plans, plots, making both friends and enemies alike.\n\nThis persistent campaign is brought to you by a large team of dedicated people with a considerable experience and skill in storytelling, scripting and world-building.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"89":{"Name":"Fate of Faer�n","Author":"Dan Bashaw and Jessica Berardi","Submitted":20070101,"Updated":20070122,"Category":"Roleplaying","Forum Thread":"www.freeforum101.com/fof","Website":"www.fateoffaerun.com","Number Players":"40","Death Type":"Still working on it.","Length":"Still working on it.","Setting":"Forgotten Realms: Faer�n","Alignments":"All","Races":"All","Classes":"All","LevelRange":"1-20\n","NumberServers":"1","Schedule":"Will officially be up on February 6th, 2007","NumberDMS":"5","Application Reqs":"Register on forum.","Death":"Based on your alignment you go to the designated death plane.","House Rules":"See forum.","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Dependant on Module","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","Treasure":"Moderate","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Players efforts","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Mixed","Connection":"Cable","Content Rating":"Mature","NumberAreas":"30-50","Description":"Fate of Faer�n is a PW in the setting of Forgotten Realms.

I soldi del personaggio sono contenuti in una borsa chiamata Borsellino.","House Rules":"REST SYSTEM (Sistema di Riposo) <>\n\nUn avventuriero ha bisogno di riposare, il riposo mira al recupero delle energie perse in combattimento.\n\nE� possibile dormire ogni 8 ore di gioco (pari a 16 minuti reali) se si � in possesso di una Stuoia nell�inventario , senza di essa � possibile riposare solo ogni 24 ore.\n\nPrima di dormire bisogna avere nell�inventario una Razione di Cibo Cotto (o qualsiasi altro cibo equivalente). Senza cibo non si potr� riposare.\n\nPer cuocere il cibo � possibile utilizzare una Fiasca d�Olio sul terreno per accendere un Fuoco da Campo, sul quale potr� essere cotta della Carne Cruda.\n\nSi raccomanda di levare qualsiasi armatura non leggera poich� dormire in armatura comporta affaticamento al risveglio. Se si dorme due volte consecutivamente in armatura le penalit� aumentano esponenzialmente. Gli effetti di questo tipo di affaticamento sono recuperabili solo riposando la volta successiva senza armature\nDurante il sonno la schermata diventa nera per impedire di vedere ci� che succede, la durata del riposo � di circa 30 secondi durante le quali il personaggio si coricher� a terra e non sar� pi� controllabile. Ovviamente il personaggio � vulnerabile durante questo periodo perci� si consiglia di dormire sempre in luoghi protetti o chiedendo a qualcuno di fidato di vegliare.\n\nDormendo si riguadagnano TUTTI gli incantesimi + TUTTE le abilit� speciali + 1 HP (Punto Ferita) x livello.\nSe si viene trattati con una Borsa delle Erbe da un guaritore (personaggio con abilit� Guarire) appena prima di coricarsi si guadagnano il DOPPIO degli HP dovuti.\n\nDormire in Locanda\n\nDormire in locanda � possibile affittando un letto dall�oste (o chi fa per esso) a un costo solitamente di poche monete. Accedendo alle stanze ci sar� un letto che se usato far� riposare immediatamente il personaggio (sempre a patto che siano passate il minimo di ore richieste (8) tra un sonno e l�altro). In questo caso il riposo risaner� TUTTI gli HP del personaggio.\nE� possibile un solo uso del letto per affitto.\n\nNew 30/11 : non c'� pi� bisogno del cibo per dormire in locanda, ne della stuoia\nNew 30/11: Aggiunto il bonus COS*Livello ai danni curati dal riposo\nNew 30/11: in aree naturali le classi di Ranger � Druido che hanno almeno la met� dei propri livelli in una delle due classi recuperano TUTTO come se dormissero in locanda, non hanno bisogno della stuoia ne del cibo (es: ranger di 3 guerriero di 2 ok... guerriero di 5 ranger 1 NO)","Language":"Italian","Scope":"Large","Tricks Traps":"Light","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Treasure":"Dependant on Players efforts","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Players efforts","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"DSL","Content Rating":"Everyone","NumberAreas":"50-100","Description":"Il nostro Shard � improntato al Gioco di Ruolo: in questo mondo gotico-fantasy a tinte fosche, avventure mozzafiato e storie intriganti.\nL' ambientazione ufficiale di Eberron presenta un mondo alternativo ai soliti FR perfetto per essere giocato su NWN2.\nLe aree sono numerose ed estremamente estese e dettagliate.\nLo staff � costantemente presente ed attento alle necessit� dei giocatori.\n","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"102":{"Name":"Kingdom of Haven","Author":"Arkosis","Submitted":20070207,"Updated":20070407,"Category":"Roleplaying","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"69","Death Type":"XP and gold loss after level 5.","Setting":"Western Coast of Faerun, near the Moonshae Islands.","Alignments":"All","Races":"All","Classes":"All","LevelRange":"1-20","Schedule":"Each Tuesday: Servant Auctions\n\nSaturdays: DMed quests\n\nDMed quests can happen at any time!","NumberDMS":"2","House Rules":"- No IC sexual encounters permitted after an OOC tell to stop\n\n- No god-modeing, auto-hitting, or auto-responding\n\n- No players under the age of 18","Language":"English","Scope":"Large","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Dependant on Players efforts","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Players efforts","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"T1","Content Rating":"Adult","NumberAreas":"10-30","Description":"Haven is an adult-oriented persistent world located in the Social tab.

","Setting":"Vous qui franchissez ces montagnes et les for�ts du Lluirbois, connaissez-vous l�histoire du Luiren et de Djannath de Hernehold ?\n\nDes d�cennies se sont �coul�es, mais le nom de ce vaillant guerrier r�sonne encore dans ces vall�es qui d�bouchent vers les mers orientales. Celui qui fut le lib�rateur du peuple Hin repose d�sormais en paix, et ses cavaliers blancs ont quitt� � jamais nos terres florissantes.\n\nDjannath fut celui qui instaura le conseil des anciens, en refusant le tr�ne ancestral qui lui �tait offert. Les ann�es qui suivirent furent cl�mentes et b�nies des dieux, dans une harmonie politique de paix int�rieure et ext�rieure gr�ce � un commerce fructueux avec les �tats voisins.\n\nVoyageur ! Si je vous parle de ces ann�es ch�res � mon c�ur, la voix teint�e de tristesse m�lancolique, c�est qu�elles semblent �tre � jamais r�volues.\n\nUn Sagespectre vous dirait que le mal est venu de l�ext�rieur, par tous ces �trangers qui d�barqu�rent de leurs puissants navires. Les Coeurvaillants, eux, clament que le commerce ext�rieur n�est plus. Enfin, quelques familles Pieds-l�gers remettent en doute l��quit� du Conseil, et surtout son efficacit� tut�laire.\n\nEn fait, le conseil n'arrive plus vraiment � maintenir l'harmonie diplomatique. A l�est, le Triumvirat de Durpar, Var et Estagund n�est plus que poussi�re. Tous savent que le pouvoir marchand �tait le garant de la paix, le bouclier qui emp�chait Dambrath d'envahir le Luiren. Malgr� ces temps difficiles, Le Luiren reste une terre d�accueil. De nombreux domaines en plein essor font appel � la moindre main d��uvre disponible afin de relancer les �conomies locales. Et de nombreux pieds-l�gers reviennent vivre sur les terres de leurs anc�tres.\n\nH�las, les contr�es halfelines ne sont plus aussi sures qu�autrefois. Malgr� la ferveur religieuse du peuple Hin, il semble que les dieux soient parfois sourds aux appels et aux pri�res. Le mal envahit peu � peu les alentours du Luiren, se resserrant autour des cit�es, comme un implacable charognard. Yondalla sait ce qu'il m'en co�te d'oser conter tant de mis�res.\n\nM�me au c�ur des villes, la vie se laisse gangrener par le vice. Les seules vraies richesses restantes, h�riti�res des temps glorieux, sont d�tenues et prot�g�es par un clerg� tout puissant et conservateur. Chaque jour, le soleil se l�ve sur de nouveaux crimes, complots, et kidnappings. Les conflits larv�s entre tel ou tel domaine s'intensifient et deviennent ainsi parfois des plus cruels. Car les vues politiques int�rieures �go�stes rendent les seigneurs, avides d�un pouvoir grandissant, aveugles aux destins de leur pays. Tous soucieux d�obtenir le soutien influent des temples, ils sont pr�ts � toutes les alliances, tous les sacrifices.\n\nVous, le voyageur, que vous soyez pied-l�ger, ou d�un autre peuple, soyez cependant le bienvenu sur nos terres.

Rather then hoping you find an item your PC can use, we use a token system. You find various magical tokens that you can turn in to various NPCs to create your item. For example, if you find a 'low-magic ranged weapon' token, you can bring a ranged weapon of your choice to the blacksmith and use the token to add a low magic enhancement from the list he provides for that kind of token. Low magic choices would include things like +1, or 1d4 added damage, or a +3 skill bonus. The higher magic the token, the more properties you can add to a max of 3 properties.

His oozing essence seeps into the ground, and trickles into a small pool outside. An elven traveler drinks from the pool. He is wracked by dreams of violence and power. \n\nSoon there are others, a whole congregation of worshippers for the imprisoned Blood God, and the Church of the Shroud is born. Mighty kingdoms fall before the Elders of the Shroud, and their dominion extends over all the realms of men.\n\nYet there is strife within the very heart of the church. The Elders praise their divine lord in public, but make no efforts to free him, seeking instead to make themselves gods in his place. Ancient prophecies have long predicted his release, but who listens to ancient prophecies any more in this age of corruption and debauchery?\n\nThe Shroud World NWN2 server was born of a proud tradition, our long-running NWN1 server was one of the very first Persistent Worlds to go live, and the campaign upon which Shroud World is based dates back to the late 1970s. Over the years, we have provided an entertaining and challenging experience to thousands of would-be heroes. We strive to continue that tradition with this new project.\n\nThis time around, we took the deeply detailed Shroud World storyline and moved it forward fifty years. We wanted old Shrouders to feel instantly at home in the new world but we did not want to simply rehash our NWN1 world. The timeline change allows us to give new life to our old tales and strike out on some completely new paths. \n\nFor those new to Shroud World, the game-play has some stark differences from what you experienced playing in the single player game. Most progression is driven by quest completion and this impacts nearly every aspect of the character; from level advancement to how NPCs will interact with you. We will soon be adding an advanced character progression system which will allow players to purchase new feats using rewards they have obtained through questing.\n\nWe chose to establish the quest system as the foundation of our world in order to offer a number of benefits to the players. Since quest completion is the primary source of experience, character classes that are less focused on brute force can often find other ways to resolve many of the quests and gain experience points. The quest system also allows us to better integrate the storyline into the day-to-day happenings of the player. The creative and humorous works of our lead writer, Rheumy Filcher, give the players a reason actually to read the dialogue of the NPCs. And finally, one of our primary goals is for players to have plenty to things to do when they log on: this is made possible by the hundreds of quests available to PCs.\n\nWhen we sat down to outline what we wanted to do with Shroud World, we came up with some pretty straight forward design criteria. I think those criteria are important to present because they are what best defines the world for the new player.\n\nSimple put, our design goals are:\n\n* A Friendly Place to Play � As a builder, I certainly get enjoyment out of watching players interact with my creations. But more importantly, Shroud World is a place where I have established real friendships and shared a comradery of people who enjoy the online gaming hobby. We believe the players are the most important part of the game world and we strive as hard to build our community as we do to develop a quality world.\n\n* An Engaging and Entertaining Story � We are a PW Story server so it would only seem right that we offer an evolving storyline that grips the player. We drive the player to immerse himself in the events that are happening around him. While Shroud World is a dark and forbidding place, many of the quests have a humorous bent. We are also building a single epic storyline that directly impacts the character through quest chapters. Our goal is to continually build on this major storyline by adding new chapters with every major update.\n\n* Redefining Adventure � As players progress, they will eventually want to take part in what we called �Adventures�. Adventures are far more involved than the dozens of dungeons the player might quest in, these Adventures are multi-area mini-campaigns designed for small groups. Each adventure has a distinct storyline and quest series that leads the player through a gauntlet of puzzles, traps, and maniacally designed Boss encounters. \n\nWe have created a number of systems to help realise these goals. Some of these systems are:\n\n� Custom Quest GUI � We have developed an interface that allows the player to see his quest information at a glance. Because a player might have dozens of ongoing quests at any one time, we need a way to display that information in a clean and world-specific format. This custom GUI allows the player to see open quests, closed quests, a list of his recently obtained quests. It also gives access to other tools like a display of online players, use of Heed�s PC tools, a �Looking for Group� toggle and more.\n\n� Fame and Faction System � Shroud World has numerous factions with which the player can interact. The fame system tracks what deeds the player has accomplish for specific factions. The higher one's fame, the more quests that become available and the player may enjoy other benefits such as new merchants or other bonuses. The Faction system determines how one faction of creatures views the player. Through quests and other means, the player can improve (or harm) his faction so that a once hostile faction will look upon him favorably. The inherent design of the system means that assisting one faction will reduce faction with another. Choose your friends and your enemies wisely.\n\n� Advanced Progression System (APS) � Our soon-to-be-implemented custom feat system integrates character development into the quest system. By obtaining tokens through quests, you can purchase special custom feats. Some feats are class specific and other feats are more generic in nature. APS allows us to give player new paths of character development; Sorcerers can become summoning specialists or focus on necromancy, for example. We expect this system to be a huge boon to our world as it allows us to extend a set of controllable abilities to players to that help alleviate some of the issues associated with using a PnP ruleset in a PW. Our goal is to make every class fun to play, able to adventure in solo mode reasonably well, and bring value to a party. The APS system allows us to accomplish this more easily.\n\n� Class Guilds � Players can join class-related guilds (mages, monks, paladins, warriors, thieves and priests) and progress upwards through the ranks via quests. Once we have the initial 20 quests completed for each of the 6 guilds, players will be able compete with other players to a obtain leadership role (based on their guild fame) and gain some special abilities.\n\nSo what type of player would enjoy Shroud World?\n\nQuesting, puzzle-solving, and a focus on tactics and strategy would have to be some of the key attributes of a Shroud World player. We consider ourselves to be roleplay-lite; we do not enforce any strict rules in that regards but we do support it. Shroud World is a player versus environment PW, pitting the forces of good against a forbidding world where evil holds the upper hand. Old alliances have been broken, and new ones forged, as the mortal plane is thrown into turmoil by a civil war within the ranks of the Church of the Shroud.\n\nAnd the Blood God? Well, someone seems to have opened his cage. There are no safe places left any more. \n\nFiles required to play on Shroudworld can be found in the Download section of Shroudworld.com","Rating":9.6,"Votes":40,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"139":{"Name":"Dominion","Author":"Team Dominion","Submitted":20070830,"Updated":20080124,"Category":"Social tavern","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"30","Setting":"Forgotten Realms","Alignments":"All","Races":"All","Classes":"Light restrictions","LevelRange":"1-30","NumberDMS":"6","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Tricks Traps":"Dependant on Module","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Dependant on Players efforts","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Players efforts","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Mixed","Connection":"100 Mbps","Content Rating":"Adult","NumberAreas":"50-100","Description":"Beyond the Great Desert lies the Kingdom of Shadowmoor and its surrounding lands.

Hack 'n' Slash will probably get you killed and death is very costly. Expect to find your character initially crafting and doing odd jobs for the town folk to make ends meet. Eventually, your character will establish a good relationship with some NPCs and be offered more difficult tasks. Your personal relationships with various NPCs will determine the path for your character. The DMs will be aware of these relationships and use them to spawn DM-Driven plots specifically for your character. \n\nNymri has a realistic crafting system designed to allow the characters to produce almost every item in the world. Nymri also has a slow level progression. It should take a player 450+ real hours of playtime to get to 20th level. And that is provided the character never died along the way. There is a Task For Level (TFL) system every five levels which means that in order to advance to levels 5, 10, 15 or 20, your character must perform a DM assigned task appropriate to your character's class and level.\n\nNymri is an Ultra Hard Core Rules (HCR) server and our mantra is that we will do everything within our power to make the world as realistic as the game engine allows. If you enjoy a challenge, great story and love to role-play, then Nymri might be the place for you.

I am the lead builder for Land of Immortals: Apocalypse, the next installment of the Land of Immortals series. This installment turn the old Land of Immortals Hardcore PvP server into a Hardcore Player v Player/Nation v Nation/Role Playing Server.\n\n A brief overview of the story is as such:\n\n Directly following the events of Land of Immortals, an asteroid collided with the planet causing a drastic change in the worlds geography as well as climates. The lands know to the old world are blanketted in persistent winter. Those who survived the impact in the old world banded together and sent out an expadition into the crater left by the asteroid to assess what was there. The leader of the expadition was Daarnin, who subsiquently went missing after the chaos crystals were found in the crater. After the discovery of the Chaos Crystals, those on the expadition noticed they felt empowered in various ways. Also while on the expadition, the existance of two new nations on two previously unknown land masses became aparent. The two other nations (House Ineo of Silvaterra and the Liberius Legion of Incendia) also found the chaos crystals and met the expadition in the crater. Naturally, the Legion chased the expadition back to Divenium as the power of the crystals was aparent to them as well. While that was happening, House Ineo took this oppertunity to begin to take the chaos crystals for themselves. The Liberius Legion became aware of this and started an attack on House Ineo territory south of the crater. Upon the remnants of the expadition from Divenium returning they told of the power of the crystals and Winterfall was officially founded in order to fully pull the nation together. Zarieth was then negotiated with to be the defender of the entrance to Divenium from the crater. The other two nations followed suit and the war for the crystals was on. Over a period of eight years, large groups of people were cast out of each nation and are reffered to as Outcasts. These are a collection of people who were near the outskirts of each nation nearest to the crater which absorbed some of the energies of the asteroids impact. They were subsiquently cast out of each nation due to their \"mutations\". Subsiquently any and all persons banished by each nation are sent to the crater to await their fate at the hands of the creatures. The outcasts banded together generally to form a non centralized tribal society. They are not a nation unto themselves, but may gain that later on in the story told through the expansions. Until then they are the bastards of each nation and are kill on site to everyone, even themselves (they have no reputation mind you, lawless nomads effectively).\n\n Each nation has its own look and feel as well as history and agenda's. \n\n Features of this expansion/revamping are:\n\nNation vs. Nation based PvP:\nPlayers of each nation square off against each other to conquer territory. Upon character creation, players select what nation their character will join.\n\nRaids:\nEach Nation has a treasury that other nations may attempt to raid to steal vital resources the nation.\n\nNations are Dynamic:\nThe Nation leader or Co-Leader may upgrade the troops in each territory owned by the nation, increase their level of training, pay the upkeep on their troops (done automatically if the nation has enough money), etc. to ensure their nations and its people stay safe.\n\nBounty Hunters:\nPlayers may take on the roll of a Bounty Hunter to hunt the enemies of different nations for Reputation, Gold, and the experience of the hunt.\nCompletely Randomized Loot:\nLoot is randomly generated based on the CR of the mob that dropped it and is reminecent of Guild Wars/Diablo 2 style naming conventions.\n\nLook:\nEach region (Silvaterra, Incendia, Divenium, and Daarnin's Crater) each have a unique geography.\n\nNation Histories:\nEach nation has a distinct and unique history that will help mold the quests and agenda's of the Nation.\n\nReputation:\nPlayers through their actions will gain or lose reputation with each of the nations. Reputation is used to determine the Characters rank, access to nation items, and other assorted things (Quests, buffs, etc.)\n\nChaos Crystals:\nNations compete for control of each of the nine Chaos Crystals in Daarnin's Crater. These crystals provide constant enhancements to characters of the nation that controls each particular crystal. These enhancements are random and are set each time the server starts.\n\nLoot:\nAll loot is customly generated upon mob spawn. Thanks to Utimagus, there are millions of possible loot spawns. All with the posibility of having a prefix noun and suffix.\n\nCrafting:\nYou are now able to tear off prefixes suffixes and nouns off an item, and then place that onto another item. \"Simply Amazing\" as our testers called it. \n\nRaids: \nEach nations capital you will find their Head Quarters. A sneaky thief can creep into the Head Quarters and locate thier national vault. If he can pass a few tricks he will leave a very happy man, and very RICH happy man. $1,000,000 of the opposing nations hard earned money. \n\nTraining Facilities: \nJust added!!! Each town and fort now has a training facility in it. If destroyed by an enemy the nation that controls it loses a random guards upgrade.\n\n\n This is just a rough run down of the server. To learn more, hop over to Link. This server adds a completely differant dynamic to nwn2. Come give us a try, we guarantee you'll enjoy your experience here.\n\n A direct link to the PWC setup application can be found Here: Link. \n\n An easy to use installer has been created for this PW.

It is a world filled with ancient mysteries and endless strife, a swirling maelstrom of exotic beauty and hell-spawned peril, where tribes value freedom more than their lives, and slaves groan under the worst kind of sorcerous oppression. It is a crossroads and a battleground where East meets West and today struggles to claw itself free of the half-remembered past. So fantastic is the reputation of this region in western Faerun that in the taverns of a dozen western cities, skeptics greet an unlikely tale or fanciful fable with a snort and mutter, �In the East, perhaps!�\n\nThe Unapproachable East is the collective name of the nations of Aglarond, Thay, Rashemen, Thesk and the Great Dale. West of Thay, in the thief-ruled City of Telflamm, the trade road known as the Golden Way begins. For thousands of miles it heads eastward, joining Faerun to the fabulous lands of Kara-Tur. Along this road lays the merchant towns that comprise the realm of Thesk, the crossroads of the Unapproachable East.\n\nA dozen years ago, the mighty Tuigan horde attacked Thesk. To meet this grave threat, the people of the western heartlands, led by King Azoun of Cormyr, raised a great Alliance made of groups from Cormyr, the Dales, Hillsfar, Ravens Bluff, and other cities. Sembia provided funds to hire mercenaries, and Zhentil Keep contributed 1000 orcs and 2000 dwarves to bring the total to 28,000 troops. This force met a Tuigan army 100,000 men strong at the First and Second Battles of the Golden Way. Eventually, they defeated the horde, but Thesk is still recovering from the devastation of the war, while struggling to accommodate thousands of Shou who fled their far eastern homeland before the horde.\n\n---\nIntroduction:\n\n�The Unapproachable East � Thesk� (UET) is a Neverwinter Nights 2 persistent world set in the Forgotten Realms. The focal point is the City of Telflamm � the heart of Thesk, in the Unapproachable East. \n\nUET was developed by a team of DMs and players from some of the most prominent and highly regarded persistent worlds of the original Neverwinter Nights game � among them are the �City of Arabel�, �Narfell� and the �City of Splendors � Waterdeep�.\n\nUET is a roleplay server. It is heavily scripted with quests and custom features that ensure there�s never a lack of things to do. Dozens of beautifully designed, sprawling areas make for a wealth of places to explore, and adventure to be discovered!\n\nThe veteran builders and scripters who work behind the scenes are tireless in their effort to continuously improve and expand the world � appreciative of feedback, and always open to players� suggestions. The in-game DMs are spread across various geographic locations � ensuring global coverage all the time.\n\nThe DMs believe in collaborative storytelling and character development - placing emphasis on helping players tell their characters� tales. They guide each one in finding a niche in the world, and attaining a sense of belonging rarely found anywhere else. Plots are always a constant � ranging from action and adventure, to comedy, drama, mystery and intrigue!\n\nAll players are welcome - even those new to the concept of persistent worlds and roleplay!\n\n---\nFeatures:\n\nQuests\nWith over 20 scripted quests available (and more on the way), there�s never a lack of things to do! Quests range from your typical hack-and-slash runs, to more complex adventures that make full use of your characters' skills, as well as your own wits.\n\nPlayer Housing\nSave up, contact one of our in-game real estate brokers and purchase property! Units range from simple lodges in the docks district, to luxurious homes in Old Town. Units feature free rest, and persistent storage for all your characters� valuables.\n\nCrafting\nA custom crafting system is in place to allow your characters to craft arms and armor, alchemical goods and magical items. A balanced economy ensures plenty of potential business for the budding craftsman!\n\nBoat System\nSave up, buy a boat and set sail to explore the Sea of Fallen Stars! Beware of pirates and other dangers though!\n\nDM Factions\nJoin the \"Shadowmasters of Telflamm\", the \"Red Wizards of Thay\", the \"Harpers\", or the \"City Watch\"! Faction members get access to special gear with unique properties (i.e. City Watch Wand) and are heavily involved in most of the in-game plots!\n\nDeath and Rest\nDeath and rest have been modified to better suit a persistent world, and to more accurately represent PNP rules. Resting can be done in any inn, or in the wild (provided characters have the necessary equipment to set camp). When faced with death, players have the option to respawn to their characters' corpses, respawn to a safe location, or to wait for a friend to cast an appropriate spell (either him/herself, or through one of several NPCs). Death penalties vary based on the option selected, and scale to the characters' level so that new characters are less inconvenienced. \n\nSpell Changes\nA number of spells have been changed to better suit a persistent world, and to more accurately represent PNP rules. New spells are in the process of being added as well!\n\nCustom Tools\nCustom tools offer players a wealth of emotes, and other useful features!\n\nBanking System\nOur in-game bank gives players a place to stash their characters' gold - keeping it safe from thieves and the dangers that come with an adventurer's life.\n\nMuch, much more!\nThere are many more features just waiting for you to discover them!","Rating":9.69,"Votes":35,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"150":{"Name":"The Legends of Arcadia","Author":"Team LOA","Submitted":20070415,"Updated":20110815,"Category":"Hack&Slash/Action","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"60","Death Type":"Free raise for PvP deaths.

Named after their deadly and most powerful move noted to kill it's targets using Glints of Light around the target.

This Realm doesnt get any sunlight as the 'Processing of Mana' outputs a slightly hazardous atmosphere for those un-aquanted with the atmosphere for a long period of time.

Plantea ofrecer al jugador una experiencia distinta a la habitual, jugando así en un mundo de corte histórico, donde el honor y la gloria son muy presentes. La base del mundo es parecida a la de L5A, pero ello no es debido a su exposición directa, más bien a la compartición de fuentes, ya que se basan mucho en la mitología y las tradiciones japonesas.\n\nA decisión del jugador está la posibilidad de elegir entre varias famílias del clan del emperador. Cada una con un dominio en concreto de las artes. Una es más diestra en el arte de la guerra, otra en la estrategia, otra en la exploración, etc.\n\nAquí se valorará mucho el rol de tipo social, ya que no todo será combate. Muchas veces tendréis que hablar ante la corte, acudir a festivales tradicionales, entrenaros en el dojo con vuestro maestro, etc todo dependiendo de la clase de PJ que llevéis. El combate existirá inevitablemente también pues éste es un mundo de guerra continua a varios frentes, donde cualquier deshonor puede desatar una tremenda batalla sin importar las muertes que dejen en su camino.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nHistoria inicial:\n\nNos encontramos en Hagakure, la capital del Imperio, signo de paz durante años tras el pacto de los Cinco Ancianos* . El emperador sale de sus aposentos para observar la ciudad que fundó hace años. Por su cabeza ronda cierta nostalgia; aquella pequeña aldea que había creado hace tiempo había crecido rápidamente dejando tras de sí las antiguas hileras de casas que ahora parecían colmenas llenas de vida. No es que le inquietara tal aumento de población, pero en sus pensamientos rondaba una pesimista predicción acerca de la paz que había logrado mantener durante tantos años. \"Es fácil controlar a un simple osezno, pero cuando este crece y se vuelve salvaje puede convertirse en algo a temer\". Aquello le hacía recordar las pequeñas revueltas civiles que surgieron en su mandato. Suspiró sin más y, al ver su guardia apostada en las escaleras del palacio, volvió en sí con espíritu renovado.\n\nSe separó del balcón dispuesto a volver hacia sus aposentos, pero algo le detuvo. Abrió sus ojos en señal de sorpresa y se quedó inmóvil unos instantes. Aquello que tanto temía se encontraba justo delante de él, aquello por lo que tanto luchaba había sido mancillado.\n\nY es aquí donde empieza nuestra historia. Rumores recientes afirman una intrusión en el Palacio Imperial. No se sabe el motivo ni sus consecuencias, pero el pergamino que recoge los mandatos del consejo de los ancianos ha sido destruido. La moral de la guardia imperial está baja estos días y la paz que tantos años estuvo asentada en Yamato puede pender de un hilo. Espías buscan el culpable de tal deshonor y la guardia ofrece pena de muerte ante tales injurias.\n\n*los 5 grandes señores de la guerra que gobiernan las provincias de Yamato\n\nMás información en la web del proyecto.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"167":{"Name":"World of Charun","Author":"The 7th House","Submitted":20080110,"Updated":20100128,"Category":"Roleplaying","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"1-48","Death Type":"Custom Perma-Death System","Length":"Infinite","Setting":"Realm of Charun - Custom Setting","Alignments":"Any","Races":"Dwarf\n- Clainthuror\n- Nurun\n- Unor\nElf\n- Eiothar\n- Niemathar\n- Sunul\n- Uluthar\nGnome\n- Belatim\n- Bulidorn\nHalfling\nHalf Orc\nHalf Elf\nHuman\n- Cadumbian\n- Easterner\n- Narghali\n- Necharamian\n- Northerner\n- Mixed Blood","Classes":"Barbarian\nBard\nCleric\nDruid\nFighter\nKamale Headhunter (a custom and very special class based on the default monk)\nPaladin\nRanger\nRogue\nSavage\nSorcerer\nWarlock\nWizard","LevelRange":"1-40","NumberServers":"3","Schedule":"Open 24/7","IPs":"Please visit our website for information.","NumberDMS":"5","Application Reqs":"No","House Rules":"Our House Rules are located on the website","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Low","Treasure":"Moderate","Experience Rewards":"Low","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"T1","Content Rating":"Mature","NumberAreas":"100-500","Description":"INTRODUCTION\n\nThe World of Charun is a unique and persistent roleplay gameworld based upon its own custom setting.

We believe that the best experiences, the best roleplay and the greatest excitement is found during events that would make good stories, movies or books. Frodo had to leave home, or there wouldn't have been a book. Player characters are encouraged to explore, loot and seek thrills. That is how legends are made.

Difficult issues and topics explored. \n-A world where �Good versus Evil� isn�t so black and white. Morality is relative and depends largely on your viewpoint. \n-A dynamic world that continues to evolve with player interactions and efforts. \n-Heavy focus on Role-Play: The history, traits, interactions, and futures of your characters. \n-Realistic level progression and spread. Start as someone with some knowhow, and work your way up slowly. \n-Smaller, closer community. Know who you�re playing with. We're all friends! \n- Server access Twenty-Four Hours a day, Seven Days a week. Only going down as maintenance and upgrades require. The server also has an Auto-Restart feature to keep it clutter and lag free. \n-Auto-download the files when you login. No hassle needed. \n-A unique and realistic spawning system for wildlife, enemies, and item loot. \n\nFirst and foremost this server is about Role-Playing. If your goal is all about collecting the loot, power leveling, or any variation of that, this really isn�t the place for you at all. However, this is about having fun Role-Playing a character.

Occult magic, Evil cultists, Myths & Legends and Cosmic Alien entities from horror writer H.P. Lovecraft pose the greatest significant threat against the otherwise ignorant humans.\n\nHumanity is not defenseless against the horrors, fortunatly enough. Science and industry prevail in the form of steampunk contraptions and clockwork gadgets. And as an inquisitive race, humans are not afraid to dig deep in occult mysteries and few have mastered the art of magic themselves.\n***\n\nThis project started with the simple goal to convert the standard d20 system which Neverwinter Nights 2 uses in to Chaosium's BRS (basic roleplaying system) which uses percentages rather then dice rolls. Eventually, after more and more planning, the idea turned from a few scripts in to a design for an online persistant world, though obviously, the amount of work increases as well. The mod changes nearly every aspect of the original game, including combat, magic & crafting. Of course, to get in line more with Call of Cthulhu, the focus will shift and there will be less dungeon hacking and more Roleplay & investigating.\n\nIRC Info:\nServer: irc.nwn2source.net\nChannel: #ExScientia","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"170":{"Name":"Dor Maeglin for NWN2","Author":"Dor Maeglin Team","Submitted":20080227,"Updated":20111125,"Category":"Hack&Slash/Action","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"40","Death Type":"Respawn is free upto level 5.\nCheap raise dead scrolls are available upto level 10.\nAll other levels suffer no penalty on death, but respawn results in massive XP loss.","Setting":"A bit of all.

We have tried to replicate, as near as we can, a true medievil world full of intrigue, betrayal, superstition and suspicion.\n\nDammendrech is not a Forgotton realms world, we have our own Gods (which should be studied carefully before you make your character), our own weapons and armour, and the vast majority of the nastiness that awaits you outside the safety of the towns walls is more in keeping with a real life environement. That means that above ground you will encounter wildlife and humanoid challenges, rather than the stock 'fantasy' creatures.\n\nYou will discover that gold and material goods have true value, both are hard to come by and should be covetted when attained. You will rarely find treasure troves just lying about waiting for some passing adventurer to pick up, for example. Every piece of equipment you acquire should feel like you have achieved something.\n\nFrom the moment of its inception Dammendrech was always about stories and intrigue and in preparation for this there are several CPC's in place ready to keep things moving along at a pace. If scheming and plotting are your idea of roleplay then Dammendrech is tailor made for you.\n\nThere is much to be learned about the two main towns, information you will not get from this website. The political systems they use, things that happen 'behind the scenes' will all slowly be revealed to the player who throws his/her character into the world and becomes a part of it.\n\nThis does not mean there is no room on Dammendrech for the more low key characters. Just as in a real life situation not everyone is concerned about making a stand for good or evil, many are only interested in that which directly affects them, and them alone. Their stories are no less valid and frequently add some extra colour to the larger world.\n\nSo, if this sounds like the sort of experience you are after why not come and join us.","Rating":10,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"174":{"Name":"Lost Dungeons of Adventure","Author":"Loudent2","Submitted":20080317,"Updated":20090707,"Category":"Hack&Slash/Action","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"10","Death Type":"On death you acquire some experience debt that must be paid before you can continue leveling.

A great deal more is happening behind the scenes, and your character can discover it!\n\nIn the year 1414, Queen Sambryl of Impiltur was a young Queen, and this year is a hard one for her country. Her once wealthy country was languishing--the harvests were hard, peasants were becoming restless and starting riots, and no other countries would trade for Impiltur's wares. And to top it off, revelations of political corruption were making the situation worse. Faced with these threats, the young queen decided to solve these problems, hopefully, in one fell swoop. In three locations across Faerun were desolate areas that were hard to colonize but held valuable and rare resources that her competitors lacked. To these three locations she sent representatives and offered land to many of the angry lower class rebels in the hope of keeping them from stirring up trouble.\n\nOne of these locations was the remote Obsidian Shores, a place both barren and rich in resources, both beautiful and hideous, home to fire and ice and the largest obisidian flow around. While the Grey Forest was rumored to be inhabited by strange spirits, Queen Sambryl ignored these rumors as superstition and sent the seed ship Wavewalker across the oceans. Among those on the ship was her distant relative, Lord Julianos, whom she established as head of the colony and mayor of the town to be built. A coolly ambitious man, he immediately took the power given to him and established a small tyranny. Commander Vastonne, one of his bodyguards in Impiltur, was appointed Commander of the Queen's Men, the guard force of the new city, which was named Stonereach. Along with the group of settlers was Lady Natalie, Lord Julianos' daughter, and several familes and smalltime rebels who had supported the riots. Jack Gill, in fact, the fierce leader of the rebellions, was among those traveling on the Wavewalker--though he disappeared while at sea and is presumed dead.\n\nThey began building the town, but soon discovered that a quiet village of natives already lived deep within the Grey Forest--the people of Skallagrim, who had never seen the outside world. It took time, but eventually the two peoples were able to understand eachother, though roughly. As relations increased, so did tension--the people of Skallagrim were unsettlingly protective of their forest, and seemed to revere it to a point approaching both worship and fear...and strange things began to happen. Animals and people disappeared into the forest, never to return, strange lights were seen and voices heard. Dreams of screaming in the forest call to the residents of the town every night. Yet, any questions asked of the Skallagrim people were met with hostility, and the forest is home to a small orc tribe, so no investigations have been made.\n\nIt has been four years, and the colony has begun to grow--the Queen's Men have become corrupt and brutal, Lord Julianos has declared the obsidian mines a huge success for Queen Sambryl, and immigrants from outside Impiltur have begun to arrive, seeking fortunes in that rare black stone. Many of the children who grew up in Skallagrim are starting to become adults and venture out on their own, and there are whispers of a secret group among the people of Stonereach....\n-numerous haks to help make the world more alive, such as hair extensions, backpacks, \"Men in Tights\", \"Shirtless Saga\", waterfalls, and more.\n\n*UPDATED* April 17, 2008, 10:48AM\nServer is now running NWN patch v1.1295!\n\nSee the official IGN page here for downloads and more information:\nLink","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"183":{"Name":"The Frontier - Reborn","Author":"Frontier Admin","Submitted":20080423,"Updated":20090509,"Category":"Roleplaying","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"60","Death Type":"Scaled XP and Gold loss, Soul Essence system.\n","Length":"Endless, we have a dedicated Story Writing team that plan our plots months in advance for an ever expanding world.\n","Setting":"Forgotten Realms Custom.

Many have forgotten the days of the War, and many of those who had lived to see it are now dead - but there are those who remember, and they say that it is all about to happen again.\n\nIn the ruins of Cormyr and Sembia, the destitute children of a generation all but destroyed have gathered, and together, for fear of the past, they pray to Bane, and don the walls of their dark cities with black banners of hatred, fear and tyranny. The Black Empire is formed, and she longs to finish what the Scourge began. The hosts of Tyrant's Hold, the beating heart of the Empire, swell with the devoted and the fearful, and every day they grow more restless. The eyes of the so called \"Black Emperor\", the Priest-Imperator and Thayan, Rethym Sulyari, gaze west - to the Sword Coast.\n\nBut the West has grown strong in the decades since the War, and the Sword Coast Alliance - a union of the mightiest northern cities, led by Waterdeep - which had once laid low the Chosen of Bane and the Scourge, is now a power to be reckoned with, and finds itself contending with more than just Banites.\n\nOut of Ruathym and Nelanthar rose the Sword Sea Union, a confederation of merchants, pirates and the worst criminals Toril has to offer. The Union's greed and undeniable cunning have seen it revive the trade lanes of western Faerun, and choke those of their enemies, and one by one, independent cities are succumbing to their raids and strongarm tactics.\n\nIn the South - the jewel of Calimshan, the great port city of Calimport ever thrives, spared the ravages of the War, and now led by an ambitious Syl-Pasha, who has regained what territory Calimshan has lost, and to the concern of all - has continued expanding. A new Calishite Empire has been carved from the ruined south of Faerun, and through both diplomatic prowess and sheer military strength, it has continued to expand and consolidate, sparking a new Golden Age.\n\nThough, power and greed ever work their will, and the wisest will tell you that Faerun is on the knife's edge, and that war is on the horizon. A war like Faerun has never seen. A Second Necromantic War.\n\nBut few can deny that these are new, exciting times for Faerun, with the Alliance as powerful and secure as ever it can begin to look beyond its borders - to its wayward colony, Calisia, which due to some mysterious event, about which little is known, was ruined, it's people vanished, it's fate a mystery...until now.\n\nAn expedition led by the almost legendary Flaming Fist, Jarn Barnison, has been formed, and mercenaries, adventurers, scholars and explorers have all gathered to take part in what will surely be the greatest adventure of this decade - the voyage west, across the horizon, to Calisia.\n\nThe new Frontier campaign titled \"Reborn\" features:\n-A new, exciting setting, truly deserving of the title \"frontier\".\n-A totally re-imagined Faerun, rebuilt in the wake of the First Necromantic Wars, with many factions vying for power, and a century worth of custom lore.\n-An array of new storylines, involving the past, present and future of Calisia.\n-A dangerous, unclaimed land, free for the shaping - or conquering.\n\nCalisia beckons - will you answer the call?\n\n\nFeatures-\nCustom scripted Death system.\n\nRandomised Spawn Encounters - Don't ever expect to be safe in an area previously visited, our randomised spawns evoke a sense of danger that you would expect from a brutal untamed wilderness. - Don't travel alone.\n\nCustom Spells, Feats Items. - We have representations of PnP spells, such as Anathema, Atonement, Speak With Plants/Animals, Detect Evil, Undetectable Alignment. As well as many custom Feats and epithets. We've also included many of the best haks found around the Neverwinter Nights 2 community.\n\nCustom Lore- We have writers and Storytellers who have used the Forgotten Realms setting as a base and used it as a springboard for a hugely indepth and detailed lore, covering many areas of Faerun. Our plotline is not based off flavour of the week monsters, but detailed politics, intrigue, subterfuge, emerging nationalism throughout the Realms, all of which the Pcs can become involved with and affect.\n\nHeeds PC Tools and DMFI - Pretty much required for any Pw, these tools give the player and the DM many opportunities for different kinds of interactions and increased functionality of the NWN2 engine.\n\nCharlies Item Appearance Changer - Allows you to customise the look and visual aesthetic of your characters to your liking.\n\nAdditional Credits for custom content:\n a huge thank you to the respective creators for these amazing pieces of work.\n\nAleannes excellent clothing packs for female pcs.

There is an in-depth storyline that has been adjusted to fit certain server criteria. \n\n STORYLINE\n\n In the years leading up to 1000, Kaelthia was fu\n\nll of magic. Most of the known land is governed by the State of Lilac. And tensions between the elven kingdom of Frinalthia and the mostly human State of Lilac have been growing due to multiple instances. The State of Lilac has also been fighting a war that has gone back centuries with the Orcs of Pede Bog that has left both sides well-versed in the art of war.\n Shortly before the dawn of the new century a rogue mage named Bulgiriden broke away from the main faction of mages of Lilac. This mage built a force of the greatest mages, and warriors from the city of Lilac and caused an uprising in which they took as many of the magical items that they could from the Mage School. A short war ensued that ended with Bulgiridens' forces being pushed out to the desert highlands of Morro, where along the way many of his fellow mages became the Dead Mages of Morro. \n After seeing the destruction caused by such an uprising, the State of Lilac banned all arcane magic, which caused an even deeper rift with the Elven Kingdom. This also caused the mages of Lilac to have their school sieged, and after a few days left the school in ruins.\n Now the forces for arcane magic plot a way to regain their power among the city and the State of Lilac has implemented martial law against all arcane. A dividing Line has been cut into the land between the Elven Kingdom and Lilac, where skirmishes take place on a regular basis. All the while the city of Lilac fights the orcs of Pede.\n In this war-torn land, the humans have embraced the dwarves of the north which has caused an even deeper rift with the elves. Arcane magic-users are hunted by Magehunters, and arcane magic items are being hunted down and destroyed.\n\n TIPS\n It may be difficult for wizards, and sorcerers as they are openly hunted by the State of Lilac. Orcs have their own city, in which half-orcs live also due to the long war between humans and orcs. Elves may have it difficult as built up tensions have caused many people in the main city to shun those of elven heritage.\n\n LOOKING FOR\n At this point we are looking for anyone interested in contributing to this project. We have multiple areas being built or built, most everything in the world will be customized. At this moment we are really looking for area builders, and anyone who has a knack for writing conversations. Every NPC in game will serve one function at the least, whether it is to sell items, be part of a quest, or divulge information. \n Please email me or write a comment if you are interested in contributing even a custom sword, most anything will help.\n\nLands of Kaelthia is going to be running Beta Testing quite soon. I am currently linking all areas together and ran a premod online for well over 17 hours, I percieve no problems in running the module online.\n\nI am currently linking the areas, proof checking the areas and would definitely appreciate feedback on the product. This is in no way a final version, most of the quests, areas planned and features such as a new crafting system will not be implemented in this version.\n\nI will post a list of haks, a pwc file and an ip address when it is almost complete for testing. Thereafter, players will be told the date of release and I will try and organize a group to run a dm quest.

The Queen granted the heroes a Keep near Atek Mountain and Falls as a reward for their service. \nMuch speculation has been done since of who was behind the attack.

A world of magic, where vortices of raw power give birth to all things arcane and divine. A world of steel, where great battles engulf the entire continent of Negaria, forever changing her face, her peoples, and marking the epochs of time. A world of balance, where no one philosophy or race holds sway.\" \n\nAvlis 2: Crosstreams is brought to you by the same NWN 1 veterans who produced Avlis; one of the largest and most successful persistent worlds for that platform. This experienced crew has taken the lessons they have learned to develop an outstanding immersive roleplay experience on the NWN 2 platform. Avlis started as a PnP campaign, and has grown from that to become more than even a persistent world. It has become a living, breathing campaign setting with thousands of years of history. It is a thriving community of dedicated role players from across the globe. Character actions influence the world, forge new history, and rarely even transcend mortality to the realms of the gods and immortals. \n\nThe detailed history of the Avlis 2 project provides players with rich roleplay opportunities. Players and DMs alike help to bring the world to life, and many players are known to spend their nights sitting at an inn room table discussing the palpable differences between good and evil, law and chaos, and the will of the gods in the world. A diverse, unique portfolio of deities provides background for nearly any character concept, and the cosmopolitan setting of the city of Crosstreams affords good and evil characters alike the opportunity to thrive. \n\nThe force of balance in Negaria is so powerful that each of the nine greatest gods has their own holy warrior to reflect their work. In addition to the paladin, the chaotic-good Avenger - who is devoted to protecting life and liberty - and the neutral-evil Annihilator - the masters of taking what they desire - have already been implemented. Six more are to come, including a new perspective on the Blackguard. \n\nIn addition, there are racial prestige classes to be implemented. Though most are in development, several are currently live. Many of these classes are based on PnP PRCs, while others are totally unique to the setting. \n\nAvlis 2 has a unique guild system. All of our NPC-containing guilds are going to be linked to our custom reputation system, which allows characters to gain and lose esteem with the various factions of the city of Crosstreams. By performing quests, participated in DM actions, and associating with PCs and NPCs from the various groups, the actions of characters will have real impact on their lives in the city. \n\nThe design team has also developed a highly dynamic custom crafting system that features nearly infinite possible combinations of materials. The result is a system in which no two crafted items are the same, and can vary in quality as well as in properties without even being magical. Spellcasters will be allowed to enchant weapons of sufficient make, allowing characters to supply each other the gear they desire for adventuring. DM events can result in gear as well. \n\nThe death system on Avlis 2 strives for a balance between the serious consequences of death while making it fun for the player. As with our other systems, the team has had the advantage of working through the player criticisms of the Avlis 1 systems and attempting to improve the roleplay experience in Avlis 2. The result is a system that penalizes death in an immersive in-character manner, by being charged by the temple of commerce to have your body ressurected. Those who fail to pay their dues, or who treat death flippantly, may find themselves losing experience points or even, in extreme circumstances, permadead until raised by a player or DM. \n\nIf you seek high fantasy, intense roleplay, and an immersive world then Avlis 2: Crosstreams is the place for you. If these things sound exciting, but you are unfamiliar with \"Heavy Roleplay\" and would like to give it a shot - come on over and say hello. Our players and DM staff will be happy to give you some pointers. \n\nWe are currently working hard to bring many of our feature systems to the live server. Builders and coders are working around the clock, but the ambitious depth of our projects, which will ultimately automate our setting, means that some systems are still being produced. We encourage those interested in building, coding, and DMing to stop by our forums and contact any other team member about opportunities to help out. This is your chance to be part of an entirely different, truly unique online videogame experience. \n\nThis is Crosstreams!","Rating":9.8,"Votes":36,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"205":{"Name":"Faerun","Author":"Youkai","Submitted":20080831,"Updated":20130322,"Category":"In Development","Website":"Link","Number Players":"64","Death Type":"Respawn at Start","Length":"It is a sandbox style game, there is no \"beginning\" or \"end.\"","Setting":"Forgotten Realms","Alignments":"Any, some NPCs may react differently to certain alignments.","Races":"Any, NPCs will may react different to certain races.","Classes":"Any, some NPCs may react differently to certain classes.","LevelRange":"1-30","NumberServers":"1-2","Schedule":"This server is not running yet.","NumberDMS":"1","Application Reqs":"NWN2: OC 1.23+\nNWN2: MoTB 1.23+\nNWN2: Soz 1.23+","Death":"The death system will be the same as single player.","House Rules":"None as of yet.","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Dependant on Module","Treasure":"Dependant on Players efforts","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Players efforts","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Mixed","Connection":"Cable","Content Rating":"Teen","NumberAreas":"100-500","Description":"**IF YOU WANT TO OFFER HELP WITH THIS SERVER, PLEASE POST IN THE MESSAGE BOARD THAT IS LINKED BY THE WEBSITE TAB ON THIS PAGE.**\n\nFaerun is a Persistent World Project.

Any line of chat that has at least 1 good key word will be given a bonus per keyword. If a line of chat contains more than 1 good keyword, the benefit will stack up to 5 keywords. If a line of RP chat contains a bad key word, such as profanity, metagaming terms, certain slang, or generally anything that doesn't belong in RP, you will receive a 25 XP penalty and it will stack for each instance.\n\nPersonal Difficulty Options - Choose your ROT experience!\n\nOptions at Character Creation:\n\nIn an effort to help new players that are not familiar to ROT or would prefer an easier time soloing through the game as it stands, we have added the following new feature to ROT:\n\nAfter you create your character, you will enter the void, before entering the portal and beginning the game, you will be given the option to choose, easy or normal difficulty. If you pick normal, nothing at all changes for you now or ever for that character. However, if you pick easy, you will get the following and the following:\n\nPositive:\n- Get 5 free permanent ability score bonuses, applied any way you wish.\n- Get 25,000 gp to start ( 1,500 gp for standard difficulty )\n- Start with 8,000 xp ( 3,975 xp for standard difficulty )\n\nNegative:\n- Pre Epic Relevel 3 (See Getting Started Page for Epic Relevel Details) Bonus XP for creatures CR 26 or higher will not apply.\n- Get 1/2 gold total from kills.\nOptions After Character Creation\n\n\n<< Extreme Difficulty Mode >>\n\nThe extreme difficulty toggle mode is available for any character. You will be able to toggle this using the PVP/AFK widget in your inventory. The setting will be saved by character in the the database, so that you won't have to turn it off/on every time you login. Using this feature is totally optional, however, be aware by using it in parties only you get the XP bonuses for the difficulty setting. Only individuals with the extreme setting on will receive the bonus XP. \n\nWhen you enter an area with the Extreme Difficulty setting on, the mobs in the are will beef up. A \"beefed\" up monster will have (EX) at the end of its name and will return to normal name once it de-beefs. When you leave the area, any remaining creatures will be de-\"beefed\". Any creature that spawns in while you are in the area, will beef up within 6 seconds. Upon killing a creature \"beefed\" you will receive additional XP regardless of ER level.\n\nWhat is the SSR?\n\nSSR is a new spawning technology that I have designed and developed that makes use of our nwnx MySql Database hookup and allows REAL TIME changes to mobs in game from outside of game. We have installed the final piece of this that alters what gets spawned several times a day for spawners that we designate as \"dynamic\". So in essence, one day you come across a pack of goblins. Another day, you might come across a group of bandits or even no one at all. You will never know what to expect where and with the above mentioned system with this, ROT will remain fun and fresh as humanly possible.\n\nServer is listed under Role Play.\n\n\n\n","Rating":9.96,"Votes":172,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"207":{"Name":"A Game of Thrones","Author":"The GoT Team","Submitted":20080911,"Updated":20100404,"Category":"In Development","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"96","Death Type":"Permadeath","Setting":"Westeros (A Song of Ice and Fire)","Alignments":"All alignments","Races":"Humans, Giants, Children of the Forest, Others\n\nRace Descriptions","Classes":"Artisan, Godsworn, Hunter, Knave, Maester, Man-at-Arms, Noble, Raider, Bloodrider, Brother of the Kingsguard, Commander, Knight, Night's Watch Ranger, Night's Watch Steward, Spy, Water Dancer\n\nClass Descriptions","LevelRange":"1-30","NumberServers":"1","Schedule":"View Our Roadmap","IPs":"See Website","NumberDMS":"3","Application Reqs":"None","House Rules":"Game Rules","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Tricks Traps":"Light","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Low","Treasure":"Dependant on Players efforts","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Players efforts","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"10 Mbps","Content Rating":"Mature","NumberAreas":"50-100","Description":"A Game of Thrones is a Neverwinter Nights 2 (NWN2) role-play persistent world set in the world of Westeros.

The story is set in an alternate reality of Faerun. The backtory to this alternate reality is as follows. Around the time soon after the events of the Original Campaign the Heart Warder (the goddess Sune's most high cleric) was murdered in his chambers by some mysterious creatures unknown to Faerun at the time. Following these events the deceased Heart Warder's second in command was appointed as the new Heart Warder of Sune. His name was Theron Crestfall and he was a fiercly determined individual. As soon as he was appointed as the new Heart Warder of Faerun his first act as Heart Warder was to search for and destroy the muderer of his predecessor. He sent out a call to all Sune worshippers to root out and bring these villians to justice. Word soon spread to Theron that the assasination order was given by followers of Cyric; and it was not long after this that word came that the long slumbering resting place of Auppenser (the slumbering god of Psionics) had been found on an island hundreds of miles off the coast of the mainland and into the depths of the Trackless Sea. And it was also being rumored that the God of Murder Cyric had sent his followers there to claim the island and to slowly devour the porfolio and powers of the slumbering god.\nAs this horrific news made its way to the ears of Theron and his followers it became obvious that action needed to be taken. Understanding that the Sunite host could not fight this new threat alone (mostly because Sunites are peace loving and not war monger types) Theron pleaded to his godess Sune for Aid. Through mysterious means (The real reason being Sune slept with Tempus and Tyr) Worshippers of Tyr and Tempus soon arrived with thier massive war fleets and batallions. Combining thier strength with the Sunites they set off for this Island called Cyria. As thier massive Armies marched up the shores they were met with fierce resistance by the Cyric worhsippers. Thier Clerics were unlike anything seen before in Faerun. The clerics and soldiers of Cyric had the ability to manipulate matter and energy with thier minds and they were equipt with fierce and brutal death spells. The battle lasted for many hours but the Allied Armies soon took a small section of the beach. With thier numbers deeply depleted the Allied Gods put out a call for adventurers and warriors alike, claiming pay and glory for thier skills and services.\n\nThis PWC is still in beggining stages of contruction. A small test PWC will be up shortly. We are currently looking for more staff members so Scripters, Builders, Dm's of all levels.

It has been converted to a coop compatible sandbox singleplayer campaign world. \n\nBut why? I hear you ask...\n\nThe server had been up for about 18 months.  In all that time I had witnessed a vicious circle of the same thing happening over and over again.   \n\nMost of the time the server was empty, however during the school holidays, new players would notice the Wulverheim server, drop by and enjoy it for a little while and then leave.  Usually they never returned.   \n\nSome of them joined the forums, left posts, a PM or Email me about how great this module is.  And I am grateful for some of the amazing compliments that have been provided.  It's always great to hear.  Yet the same players that provided this wonderful feedback also seemed to disappear after a while. \n\nI'm not sure why this kept happening.  Whether its because players get bored of waiting for the next group of players to discover the server and join in, something I've said, real life getting in the way or someone killing them off.  Either way, this appeared to be the curse of playing Wulverheim online.   \n\nWhatever the reason, what really mattered is that whilst it was happening the server population never grew. \n\nI did what I could to advertise Wulverheim and get it out there, but people pay very little attention.  I don't know how many players if any have attempted to use the \"Word of Mouth\" technique, but anyway... I guess it's too late for that. \n\nNo matter... I present to you instead the singleplayer and multiplayer coop version of Wulverheim in all its glory!\n\n\nHere are some comments from the players that enjoyed Wulverheim when it was online, as left in the forum:\n\njon_aylows\n\nI only just discovered this server tonight after purchasing the NWN2 Platinum Pack from the recent Steam Summer Sale. \nI've been looking for a high quality Australian Persistent World after experimenting for a bit on the Baldur's Gate Sword Coast Chronicles server (gave up due to lag). I don't mean to sound arrogant, but my standards for a PW are exceptionally high. I can't stand to play anything that feels tacky or half-assed. \nWhich is why I am stunned and absolutely blown away by the quality of this module. It's brilliant. It's incredibly polished. You've even got Diplomacy, Bluff and Intimidate checks right from the start. There's extensive backstory to read up on, the cities are hand crafted and believable and the Guild system is fantastic. \nThe starting quests are well designed and enjoyable - and it is immediately apparent a lot of thought has been put into this world. I only got my character up to level 4 before having to log off (I'm a courier now - hooray!), but I was so impressed with Wulverheim that I had to create this forum account just to plead for you not to take this server offline. \n(And believe me, I do not create brand new forum accounts lightly or on a whim - but I just had to this time - it's too good to go unrecognised!) \nThere is incredible potential here - you just need to advertise on prominent Australian game communities - Internode and GameArena to name a couple - who as another poster mentioned have had strong NWN followings since the days of Nordock. \nAgain, this is exceptional work. Professional-level even. You can't just take this offline and let it fade into obscurity. You just need to tap into the huge Oceanic community - the ones who want to play on the only low-ping persistent world in the region. \nFor those reading this - trust me when I say this is 10/10 quality work - please keep this running for multiplayer. We just need to bring it to more people's attention. As the earlier poster mentioned, it is an undiscovered gem lost amidst the trash of the other persistent worlds. \n\n- Jon Aylows, Level 4 Fighter, future Weapon Master.\n\nClash\n\nI'm surprised how little attention your server is getting. The quality is amazing and I haven't had this much fun since the old days playing NWN1 on servers like Nordock and that speaks volumes. I can tell a lot of detail has been put into this as most other modules I've been on tend to overlook the little details that would have add more depth to game play. \nIt's defiantly well polished as there's numerous quests to do. Correct me if I'm wrong but I notice the spawns get stronger as I level as I seem to have a never ending challenge which I think is awesome and the fights never get too easy so its all thumbs up for me! The XP system is very unique in its own way as I haven't seen this anywhere else and the Guilds are even more impressive even though I've only scratched the surface. \nOh and the most important thing it seems to be only Aussie server around so I strongly believe it must stay online. It the one and only server I can play without any lag. icon_lol.gif \nI do hope more people and especially more Aussies to take notice and try this place out, it will be a shame to see it go offline.\n\nNecrosphere\n\nAs a long time NWN2 player, I've just stumbled on this server from a link in, of all places, Youtube. \nI've got to say, I'm impressed. I've played on quite a few worlds out there, BG, TFR, DoN, EoA, MoA, Sigil and Necrosis are the ones I can recall off the top of my head, and I can safely say that none have the sheer volume of quests that are easy to find that there are here. \nAnother big plus is the server is in Australia. Do you know how hard it is to find an AU server, and even more telling, a good AU server?? \nFrom a gaming point of view the server is pretty to look at, not unmanagebly big to download, easy to navigate and the quests seem logical... you want to find the silver ore? Go look in the mine...\n \nSokar Rostau\n\nI say keep it multiplayer for the sole reason that this server is an undiscovered gem. I'm not crawling, I mean that sincerely. \nThe world you have created is exceptionally well designed and has one of the key things missing on other servers - scope. The sheer size of Wulverheim makes it stand apart from other servers and leaves more room than most players could wish for to do things, whether their taste is RP or H&S. Importantly, you could halve the XP rate and most PCs still wouldn't need to grind because there's so many places to hunt. The few occasions when I have had to grind I have done so to complete quests I had repeatedly failed which entirely removes the grinding feeling. \nThere are already more quests in-game than I have seen on most servers and you have stated that you intend to add more. Most servers wouldn't even offer the number of current quests, let alone more. Again, the quests you have seem designed to relieve the tedium of grinding because you have a purpose to keep killing the same things.\n\nSaintjon\n\nMy friends and I recently picked up the game, we found your server yesterday and we love it! It is far and away the best server we have found so far and we plan to (we hope to) be around for quite some time. There are about half a dozen of us at present and in time we might be able to get more people if they get sick of playing LoL like we did.\n\n\nLordFatee\n\nI'm amazed at the detail and work that Shockwolf has put into this world. Amazing job! I'm just at the very beginning of what I hope will be a long and prosperous adventure.\n\nAedh\n\nWhile my experience with NWN2 is limited, tried multiplayer last night for the first time. We bounced around a few of the empty servers until we happened upon yours. \nBoth of us were extremely impressed with the detail and apparent depth you have created. I say apparent because we only made it to 3rd level. I can tell a lot of work went into this and it's appreciated. \nI hope you to keep it MP for selfish reasons, a few of us plan on playing it when time permits.\n\n","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"215":{"Name":"Sigil: City of Doors","Author":"cryptc, Mr_Otyugh","Submitted":20081115,"Updated":20100808,"Category":"In Development","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"TBD","Death Type":"Respawn to Sigil with xp and gold penalty.","Setting":"Planescape","Alignments":"All.","Races":"All, also custom races granted by special DM permission.","Classes":"All.","LevelRange":"1-30","NumberDMS":"2","Application Reqs":"None.","House Rules":"ECL races are limited to maxlevel their ECL less than 30 (so Drow can max be 28th level), this also to balance custom races that will be granted and can have alot higher ECL.","Language":"English","Scope":"Large","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Medium","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Moderate","Experience Rewards":"Moderate to High","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"DSL","Content Rating":"Adult","NumberAreas":"100-500","Description":"Sigil � City of Doors in nutshell\n\nConcentration:\n\n- SCoD is mainly roleplay server with possibility to adventure in many planes.\n- Plenty lore will be provided, but you are not required to read all of it to play.\n- Experience will not be made overly hard to get, but monsters won�t be overly difficult to require superior builds to play either.

The world is mostly underground and character advancement is largely achieved via quests.\n\nYou begin the game in one of four �roles�; fighter, mage, rogue, or healer. Once you reach level 7, you choice one of two distinct paths. At Level 13, you choose your final path; for example a player beginning as a Rogue could go Rogue > Ranger > Marksman. Level progression is just a small part of the overall character advancement; you have numerous opportunities to advance your character outside of gaining levels. Characters can earn new feats, traits and abilities through adventuring, questing, or buying special training.\n\nAdventuring in The Depths is dangerous business but the characters are well equipped to face these challenges with numerous tactical feats that they can activate to change the tide of battle. Grouping has its benefits as the combat tactics of your class can give bonuses to other classes.

Sylthos was originally created back in the summer of 1989, and has a rich roleplay history influenced by the players, as well as rich and varied histories and backstories.\n\nThe Solgrathia Region of the Inthrell continent makes up the northern third of Inthrell. Once very populous and highly advanced, it is now a depopulated and cursed realm. Though there are small islands of civilization, most of Solgrathia is wild and ruins of the past can be found everywhere.\n\nThe possibilites are endless! Take your character where you want to go - the DM Team strives to make Solgrathia a fully interactive world that seems \"real\"; NPC's have their own personalities and agendas. Your character can forever change the landscape...or if you prefer, can work in the shadows behind the scenes. \n\nMore than five centuries ago, the Dark Wars were being fought. The City of Solgrathia, capital and seat of the Sapphire Throne of Solgrathia, was under seige. Nestled at the base of the Moorlock Pass over the Spine Mountains, the forces of the Dark Empire were planning the last battle of the Dark Wars.\n\nAs the time of the last battle approached, the Dark Wars had been fought off and on for the last half century - slowly but surely sapping the strength of the Kingdom of Solgrathia - and all the others in the Region. For the first and only time, all human kingdoms in the north of Inthrell were united against a common enemy.\n\nThis battle was different. The Seige of Solgrathia had been going on for six months, but allied troops were still able to fight their way in to supply the city and bolster it's defenses. Then word came - the Dark Emperor, rumored to have lived for over two millennia, was coming to turn the tide of the war. Everyone in Solgrathia knew - if the city was to fall, the Dark Empire would expand West of the Spine Mountains, and all of Inthrell would eventually be under the dominion of the Dark Emperor.\n\nAs the Imperial troops made a last charge on the Day of Wrath, the Sorcerer King of Solgrathia set in motion a desperate plan. Magics long prepared were set loose, and the brightness of the light was seen for many leagues around the city. The few survivors of the Day of Wrath later reported massive heat and blinding light that destroyed all combatants near the city, save one. The Dark Emperor, alone on the field, cursed the Realm of Solgrathia, and darkness descended after the light of moments before.\n\nOver the last five centuries, the remnants of the human kingdoms slowly faded. Generations of war had thinnned their numbers, and disease finished off those who had left. Eventually, only the Solgrathians maintained any kind of civilized society - the rest became wandering barbarians or disappeared from Solgrathia alltogether.\n\nThen there is the curse. Humanoids that die in the Solgrathia Region do not go on to their eternal reward. Instead, they rise, night after night, doomed to never be at rest until the curse is lifted. The West is free - though at the cost of Solgrathia. The Moorlock Pass cannot be reached - for one must go through the City of Solgrathia's ruins, and since the Day of Wrath, none return from the ruins of the once-great city.\n\nShadows of the glory and majesty of the past rise every night, and exist in the many ruins and items in the forests, swamps and tundra of Solgrathia. Will you struggle to survive, fight for civilization, or make room for yourself in the vast expanses? Solgrathia awaits...

A depression has loomed over the city for sometime, due to the plague bringing monsters which soon overran the trade route into the city. The City Watch has fallen short, and many lives has been lost during this time. \n\nYour goal is to escape from Blightmoor and find hope in the outside world. Your escape will not be easy, and perhaps even death defying as you betray the city of Blightmoor. Can you free the city from the grips of the king and restore the economic system? Or will you fall before the king and his men. \n\nThe fate of Blightmoor lies in your hands.\n\nAuthors Note -\nThis will be the first part of my Blightmoor Campaign. There will only be 14 areas to explore, but more will be added over time. Most part of this gameworld takes place in the city of Blightmoor, with very little outside exploration.

It is based on the lore and storyline of the popular Diablo series but with the accent on role play. It started as a pet project of one of the dev's and has been brought to fruition by a team of dev's, long time players and DMs.\n\nThe Diablo Tales will feature many new custom classes to experience. From the mysterious and powerful Zann Esu clan of female sorceress', to the veiled brotherhood of the Vizjerie, you will find an interesting assortment of classes, all based on the original game. Custom lore to vividly imagined landscapes, Diablo Tales is a server that will encourage imagination, growth, and quality roleplaying.\n\nAs players enter the world of Diablo, they will be taken on a nostalgic journey in the form of quests to complete the the events that occurred in the original games. This will be an imaginative way to not only refresh veteran Diablo players, but also to introduce new players to the storyline and gain a few starting levels. After this plunge, the players will actually begin their role playing lives with a bit of background due to this effort. Their actions from this point on will help shape the world, with every character having the opportunity to become the world's greatest hero. Players can participate in guilds, miltiary arms or secret organizations that have real influence in the world.\n\nTales of Diablo employs many unique prestige classes as well. Take up the romantic peril of the barbarian Aitre'in charged to protect his ever headstrong Maiesta Zann Esu sorceress. Or become a Blade of the Sightless eye and be an elite guard for the secrets of the cities.\n\nOne of the unique features of 'Tales' is that the players all have the same basic agenda: To protect the world from the many plots and trials devised by the evils demons and thier allied cults.

What we are after is a heavy-RP server that doesn't rely upon lengthy or restrictive rules. Instead, we aim to create a server in which the game mechanics create a fun environment in which role-playing and adventuring becomes so rewarding (in more ways than mere XP) that players will naturally do so. We provide activities such as hunting and fishing (and soon, crafting) as additional gameplay options. Many of these subsystems are tied together in such a way that they support each other and allow even more player options.\n\n Grinding is going out the door. Few people enjoy slaying the same critters for hours on end so why ask them to do it? Forcing players to grind to obtain levels and gold also creates an environment that is inherently hostile to role-playing. We aren't making rules against grinding, instead, we simply set up the PW in such a way that players obtain sufficient XP and gold as they play. Furthermore, our server is mostly built to cater to levels 5-15. Once a character is within that range, it will be possible to adventure through dozens of areas while completing quests, searching for resources or simply exploring. There is no need to grind for hours so that one may advance to the next area and repeat the process.\n\n Now all this talk about RP doesn't mean that we intend for players to simply sit around campfire and chat (although we do provide for those who enjoy such activities). Not at all. Sea of Dragons is designed to promote adventuring. Classic DnD role-playing takes place when a party sets forth on a journey and that is exactly what we wish to promote. A typical adventure has enough lulls in the action for players to role-play and plan out the next course of action. But be warned! Just because everything seems quiet doesn't necessarily mean that danger isn't just around the corner. When the action hits, things can get pretty intense.\n\n Players will find that in Sea of Dragons, it's not just about winning the battles. The overall strategic approach to the entire adventure is just as important. Most encounters in the wilderness will be little more than a hindrance when taken alone. But care must be taken not to expend all of the parties resources before reaching the destination. It's more about winning the war and gaining the objective (whether that be a quest or reaching the bottom of a dungeon) than simply fighting pointless battles.\n\n Please come and visit us at Sea of Dragons and enjoy some adventure on the southern coast of the Moonsea.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nAutodownloader: No need to mess with .pwc files or haks. Just connect to Sea of Dragons to obtain the files automatically.\n\nDynamic NPC's: They react differently depending upon a PC's race, skills, stats amongst other things. Each PC has an individual reputation with NPC's and thus PC/NPC interactions often result in long term consequences.\n\nVaried spawns: One can never be absolutely certain what monsters will be found when entering many of the areas.\n\nQuests: Though we have not yet implemented many of them, we do have a dozen or so and intend to implement many, many more. Please note that many of these quests have several paths and are not simple Fed-Ex quests even if they appear so at first glance.\n\n(partially implemented)Randomized monster gear: Some monsters types will spawn with different mundane gear sets (a greatsword or a bow), while others may spawn with magical gear that can be looted. Be fore-warned though, that monster will use the gear against the player!\n\nRandomized loot containers: We have \"chests\" (under a variety of appropriate appearances) that are randomly seeded throughout areas. The randomized locations prevent chest farming runs and encourage thorough exploration. Since January 2011 we have also added the LEG dynamic loot system. This creates a wide variety of gear based upon Dungeon Master Guide loot criteria.\n\nCustom appearance changer: It is extremely versatile and avoids common bugs to these types of systems.\n\nProjectile recovery: Ranks in craft weapon allow a PC to recover a portion of spent projectiles.\n\nCustom gear: All of the gear will be custom made for the PW. We currently have a basic package suitable for low level PC's that weighs in at around 2000 items. This is just a basic package! More will be added as we build. Thanks to the LEG loot system, players can expect to find an almost unlimited variety of unique gear besides the prefabricated items.\n\nHunting, fishing and foraging: All provide additional ways to role-play a character, apply skills towards activities that net a PC useful supplies. Fresh meat, animal hides and fish can be sold for a small profit. Players can expect us to expand upon these systems in the future.\n\nBounty system: These are repeatable, party-based quests that involve hunting down some boss monster (or just a rare spawn) and generally provide a sizable XP and gold reward.\n\nPackhorses (still prone to bugs): For those who wish to gather or transport large loads of heavy items.\n\nImproved alcohol system: Imbibing alcoholic beverages has more impact on a character.\n\nCharacter creation options: Many players compliment us on this one. We have lots of heads, hairs and color options added in along with the extended size changer and the ability to add longer descriptions. We are always adding new content in this category.\n\nAmbushes: Depending on the area, there is a chance for an ambush upon resting.\n\nClimbing: There are areas that can be climbed using a climbing script.\n\nCreature AI: Don't expect all creatures to act the same way. Some swarm, some run away, some are entirely stupid. Some have even more unique abilities which will not be listed here so as to prevent spoilers. Since December 2010, we have started adding monsters with special PnP properties.\n\nExplosives: These handy things can be obtained and then used for a variety of purposes.\n\nArmor Movement Penalties: Wearing more armor might mean more protection but it will slightly reduce movement rates as it gets heavier. Armors like hide and scale weigh less and are therefore useful in regards to avoidance of movement penalties.\n\nSwimming: Sea of Dragons uses the RWS swimming animations.\n\nPain's Monster Pack: In an effort to bring players the best custom content from the Vault yet minimize excessive downloading times, we are moving towards community-friendly haks. This includes Pain's monster packs which contain all the creature models available for download on this site. Players who download these haks will not have to get them again when connecting to any other PW that uses the same haks. Dungeon Eternal 2 is one such PW.\n\nPain's Spell System: This extensive spell system brings together many spells from sources such as Graycloak's Compedium and Kaedrin's Spellpack and unites them within a powerful framework. This provides so many benefits that they cannot be be listed here. One such benefit is that warlocks no longer suffer any of the bugs which have plagued them for so long.\n\nExtra feats: Though still in progress, we have started adding in new feats from various sources such as Kaedrin's.","Rating":9.81,"Votes":46,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"239":{"Name":"World of Isandor - Renaissance","Author":"Chastine","Submitted":20100228,"Updated":20100731,"Category":"Roleplaying","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"50","Death Type":"Death is handled per situation.

If you wish to crack some skulls and reach level 20 within 10 seconds, this isn't the server for you. The only ways to gain levels in this server is through RP. You start out stranded on an island, How you got there? That's your choice. The community is very open minded and will love new Roleplayers and ideas.\n\nThe server also has a custom crafting system. At creation the character is able to choose from various professions, such as, a Blacksmith, Tinkerer, Alchemist, and other such professions. Again, there's no limit to what you can be on this server. All subraces are open, except some must be voted upon in the forums due to certain race bonuses.\n\nCharacters are able to build their own towns, custom weapons, and other such items.\n\n\nWe will discuss our atmosphere:\n\nWe are a Medium Roleplay Server. not heavily bent on PvP and PK'ing for action. Roleplay is our Adrenaline. often times we use emotes and dicerolls for our actions. PvP is for very confrontational views on the situations of events, however we DO allow for PVP for certain occasions.\n\nOur server base starts players out at level 1. however with no experience points given on Creature Killing you are reliant on roleplaying to gain your levels. Our main goal is to provide a PnP atmosphere with quality events that involve epic roleplaying. We expect high quality roleplay from you. We give you almost a 'free-form' or 'Sandbox' Realm that you can basically create ANY type of character. We let you play ANY subrace you want to be .. 'within reasoning of course' . For those with the creative mind. We also let you create your own subraces with stats.\n\nUnique-ness of Isandor:\nThe Lands of Isandor server are unlike most other NWN roleplay servers. It was originally created with the idea that the creativity of the player is key. The server is never tied to a specific fate, we enjoy the roleplay of any situation. The players of Isandor would be best described as those that like a good and challenging story for there character, no matter what the ending could be. Death is fickle, life is valued, and caution is highly advised. There are no villains, there are no heros. Nothing is so clear in this world.\n\nDM Guided Events:\nthe world has no one goal. The avarage Isandor player will enjoy even a \"Casual\" day. There is no race to reach the highest level, or go on the most dangerous adventure. Things come to be, in a more natural way. There are no monster spawn camps to go to, there aren't even any NPC merchants. Experience is only gained by acts of roleplay and importance. A person cannot advance simply by killing the most wolves or goblins, if he has no soul or greater meaning, he is non existent. (This is used to keep the roleplayers as the most important players in the server) A player does not even need EXP to have fun or importance, as most will never reach the level of 8. True legends start early on (Not at level 20).\n\nCOMPLETE Player Driven World:\nThe world is simply run by the players. As players are given more freedom to the changes they wish in the world or the havoc they wish to cause. Everything has a purpose, goblins wont leap out of the bush just because you stepped on an invisible in game trigger,\n\nthey will be there for a reason. That alone will be cause enough for alarm or worry. Most encounters will be guided by a dedicated DM, for a feel of realism and importance. A players actions are never trivial or unimportant, Fishing and foraging is essential to survival.\n\nIsandor has always been one-of-a-kind due to the majority of scripting and enhancement of roleplay by it's players. Isandor is truly a unique sandbox styled server that allows freedom; a freedom to play the character you want to play from wherever you want him/her to be from. Isandor allows the freedom to create your own deity - and RP them however you like. Settlements can be formed and with enough players can someday form into a city. A unique player-run world creates the atmosphere provided for a totally unpredictable world. There are no NPC shops, so you as a player can take up a tradeskill and progress in it as a craftsman or fill a variety of other jobs in the community. You can take up as many tradeskills as you can manage, but remember, other players are your competitors if you choose to do this and they may specialize in a single craft. Whether you are a specialist or a jack of all trades craftsman is entirely your choice. Who will you be, and what will you become?\n\nYou can select from up to 10+ sub-classes ranging from Builder, Enchanter, Cook and many more. If these are roleplayed correctly, then overtime there's a chance you'll be given a DM event to more than one skill point.\n\nThe world's history is up to you and those around you. Forge your own personal legend as a gallant hero or a notorious villain, or simply live the life of a commoner, again the decision is yours.\n\nIn Isandor Game Masters run \"Events\" rather than \"Quests\". Events that are apart of the storyline can sometimes last many months. These events are imaginative and usually allow the players to shape the world�s direction. Even smaller events thought up by the GM's are moulded to the character�s actions, and involve moral and personal decisions. Due to the strong RP of the player-base, player run events are quite frequent and the GM�s are usually happy to assist you if you have a good idea for one. Events such as the eruption of Isandor's volcano or nasty storms are some examples of simple events that create further interaction between Isandor's people.\n\nWith community approval, you can play mythical sub-races such as mephitis, goblins, fairies, brownies kobolds, werewolves and vampires. Or, if you're feeling creative, you could create something entirely different up for yourself to play. It's entirely upto you.\n\nIsandor sports its own hardcore rules system. The Ration System incorporates your action in the amount of food you need. The more you work, the more you eat. If you get too hungry you'll slowly deteriorate.\nThe head GM and World Crafter Chass has scripted 90% of what's in the module.

Both expansions (Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir) are required. It is set in the \"Shining South\" realm of Fáerun, specifically the nation of Amn and has existed as a persistent game world since 2007. We've seen some changes along the way, but the core focus on a friendly community, immersive roleplay, and preference to player and character driven plotlines continues to define us. You will find some of the best thought-out character concepts and roleplayers here.\n\nExodus: Shadows of Amn offers an intensive gaming experience, the main focus being on roleplay. The Dungeon Masters draw players into webs of intrigue and adventures as well, allowing the player characters to develop in unique ways. We provide personal plots and plot hooks for all types of characters. This focus on the aims each player sets for his/her character, and freedom for the character to act in the setting is what truly sets Exodus apart. The players who take charge and initiative of their characters actions as those characters grow and advance in the setting are the ones who will thrive.\n\nAmn is very different from more commonly presented Forgotten Realms settings, such as the Sword Coast. It is shrouded with intrigue and mystery, lush with plots for the adventurer or the merchant, the assassin or the diplomat. Amn is rich with opportunities for you, the player, to explore.\n\nAmn as a setting can be more challenging to traditional D&D adventurers, arcane spell-casters and non-human races, but these will not be felt by new players immediately. They will be gradually brought to bear as players become more familiar with the setting and their characters advance in level.\n\n *-Other Information-*\n\nExodus uses core D&D rule sets and skills. Also, the lore regarding Amn can be found from our forums and it is recommended to take look at it, to gain more insight into the setting.\n\nThe community often gathers in irc, to agree about events and meetings in game. Major events are also announced separately in the forums. *Our DM schedules are also available in the forums.*\n\nNew characters start with 3000 xp which is awarded the first time they meet a DM in game, meaning that non-ECL characters will begin at level 3.\n\n\n*The server password is available after registering on the forums and submitting a character bio. Any reasonable attempt at a character bio will be accepted. This isn't to prove you're worthy to play here; it's to encourage you to think about the setting, and gives the DMs some indication of what kind of plots to devise for your character.*\n\n *-IRC Information-*\n\n Network: irc.sorcery.net\n Channel: #exodus\n\n ======","Rating":9,"Votes":12,"Awards":[]},"241":{"Name":"The Rise of Sauron: 3rd Age Middle Earth","Author":"TRS Crew","Submitted":20100729,"Updated":20110502,"Category":"Roleplaying","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"30","Death Type":"Fugue System: No corpse, re-spawn to a choice of binding points.","Length":"Persistent","Setting":"Middle Earth, 3rd Age, in the years following Sauron's re-appearance in Barad-dur, and leading up to the War of the Ring.","Alignments":"Lawful Neutral, Chaotic Neutral and True Neutral are not available as alignments in this version of Middle Earth.\nAll Evil alignments are allied with Sauron, no exceptions.","Races":"Custom races as per Middle Earth Settings.\nSome races require an application form.

However there is also equal opportunity to uncover many of the mysterious secrets that the continent might hold. Perhaps you might be the first to see what no one else has seen, to learn aspects of an art that has yet to be uncovered or developed in full, or rise to heights that some might only dream of within your society.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, a naval fleet from the Old Empire of Halmoria discovered a continent far to the east of their existing shipping routes. Imperialism had just taken hold in Halmoria; Lord Emperor Alphaeus III hungrily expanded the borders of the Old Empire in every imaginable direction. Before long, the Emperor sent armed forces, tradesmen, and farmers to settle in and establish the newly found land. The first ships to arrive were greeted by the existence of a city.\n\nThe massive, rugged stone fortress stood silently and eerily. Its spires reached for the skies above, casting still shadows on the structures below. However, not a soul was found within its granite walls. The only clue as to those who inhabited this abandoned metropolis before the settlers got there was a lone obelisk in middle of the silent city. It read \"Atalan.\"\nThe newly arrived Halmorians began to unravel the secrets of Atalan. Noblemen, merchants, adventurers, pioneers, vagabonds, and those wishing to flee from the Old Empire flocked to the new colony. The migration happened for a plethora of reasons, some of which are darker than others. The legacy of Atalan was and still is completely dependent on its immigrants.\nSome of the early scouts, having explored some of the timbered lands surrounding Atalan, began to speak of unhuman cratures spotted in the wilds. At first, others laughed at this, but many soon realized that these tales were true, that the creatures previously only known in myths--Elves--were real. Soon after, the scouts discovered Halflings, Gnomes, Orcs and Dwarves. Where mythology is actually reality, the humans of Halmoria were not alone.\n\nWe invite you to explore the Myths of Atalan with the many others who look to make their mark on the world. The myths of the world are yours to discover. \n\n\nFeatures:\n\nCompletely custom setting in a new world ripe for exploration.\n\nAutodownloader: No need to mess with .pwc files or haks. Just connect to Myths of Atalan to obtain the files automatically. \n\nCustom races and classes, with PrCs unlockable through RP.\n\nUse of many exploration and knowledge based skills in the world and DM events.\n\nEvery race has a unique starting location.\n\nReputation: What you do and say in game has real consequences.\n\nLarge DM team that enhances players time on the server.\n\nXP Rewards: Two Custom XP systems to choose from to enhance your experience.\n\nTreasure: Custom items with a dynamic system so what you find is always changing.\n\nResearch: Through forum and in-game research you can discover new locations, create new paths of discovery, even create a new spell that your character will be known for.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"244":{"Name":"Greyhawk: City of Rookroost","Author":"Mammon","Submitted":20100826,"Updated":20100904,"Category":"In Development","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Number Players":"30+","Death Type":"10%/level respawn penalty, all goods with corpse, raise dead spells according to Pathfinder pen and paper rules.","Length":"Long.","Setting":"Greyhawk Campaign Setting, Pathfinder D20 ruleset (equivalent DnD 3.75)","Alignments":"All alignments","Races":"Expanded Pathfinder D20 races list.","Classes":"Modified Pathfinder D20 classes.","LevelRange":"1-15, slow progression ","NumberServers":"1","Schedule":"Alpha Launch October 23rd.","NumberDMS":"4","Application Reqs":"Applications for player faction membership and special races.","Death":"Hardcore Death Rules","House Rules":"The campaign is built to mimic Pathfinder D20 rules as closely as the engine will allow.","Language":"English","Scope":"Medium","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Treasure":"None","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Module","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"T1","Content Rating":"Mature","NumberAreas":"30-50","Description":"Take a journey to the World of Oerth, home of the city of Greyhawk!

Me he fijado que tenéis una sección en vuestro foro para módulos y quería postear la información de nuestro mundo por si alguno se anima a visitarnos :) Si cualquier administrador/moderador de esta comunidad cree que este no es el sitio pertinente le ruego que mueva/modifique el post como crea conveniente.\n\n La Isla de los Grifos es un mundo persistente de Neverwinter Nights 2 basado en la antigua campaña de mesa homónima del juego de rol RuneQuest. Se trata de un mundo abierto a cualquier jugador que lleva online 2 años y medio (sin contar el año de desarrollo inicial) creado según los siguientes principios básicos:\n\n - Un mundo bastante fiel al módulo original, con algunas modificaciones que nosotros mismos realizamos sobre la campaña de mesa.\n - Un motor de juego \"low-magic\" modificado para aportar mucho más realismo y equilibrio que el original de NWN2 (siempre desde nuestro punto de vista, claro).\n - Un sistema de juego personalizado para forzar y premiar el roleo por encima del \"mata-mata\"\n - Reglas modificadas para intentar acercar más el modelo D&D base del juego al modelo de RuneQuest (aunque sea hacia la versión de RuneQuest que nosotros usábamos en mesa)\n - Gran cantidad de secretos y áreas para descubrir (algunas de ellas aún por descubrir después de casi 3 años online), ya sea por ingenio o mediante un amplio espectro de habilidades y capacidades (no sólo matar al bicho que la proteje)\n\n Creemos asimismo que la ambientación y la immersión es uno de los factores críticos de un mundo persistente, así que hemos dedicado muchos esfuerzos a las mismas. En concreto, podéis encontrar centenares de referencias dentro del juego además de disponer de una nutrida sección de Trasfondo. Para la comodidad de nuestros jugadores y como muestra del nivel de detalle que ofrecemos en la Isla, hemos publicado una completa Guía de Trasfondo ( Link ) en la que podéis encontrar desde historia antigua de Glorantha (el mundo donde está situado el servidor) hasta bestiarios, guías de interpretación de las diferentes aproximaciones mágicas, etc...\n\n Por supuesto, hemos utilizado muchas de las herramientas nuevas disponibles en NWN2 para ofrecer sistemas y una personalización imposible de alcanzar en el NWN1. Como muestra podríamos destacar:\n\n - Sistema de Talentos: a las ya de por sí nuevas clases de prestigio y nuevas dotes generales que hemos introducido en el servidor, se han añadido árboles de talentos para todas las clases base (actualmente están en pleno funcionamiento para la mitad de ellas). Mediante el uso de Puntos de Rol se puede avanzar en ellos y obtener nuevos poderes y capacidades que mejorarán a nuestro personaje según nuestro gusto.\n\nLink\nLink\nLink\n\n - Sistema de Comercio: habéis deseado siempre ser comerciantes con vuestras propias mercancías exclusivas que podáis fabricar y vender según vuestro propio criterio, sin necesidad de DMs, mediante un sistema completamente automático y que os permita experimentar la sensación de ser auténticos comerciantes? Bienvenidos al Sistema de Comercio de la Isla de los Grifos ;)\n\n - Sistema de Equipo de Calidad: comprad o encontrad armas, armaduras y escudos de diferentes calidades y pedid a un herrero que los personalice según vuestras necesidades.\n\n - Una miriada de pequeños sistemas que cambian drásticamente la experiencia de juego, como la Saturación (auto-regulación de ingesta de pociones), creación libre de varitas y bastones (con cualquier conjuro disponible y apilable), Rastrear y Sentir Magia (para seguir rastros de animales y presencias sobrenaturales) y un larguísimo etc...\n\n En ese sentido tenéis disponible una completa Guía del Jugador ( Link , actualizada mensualmente) con todo lo necesario para empezar a jugar y todos los sistemas existentes en la Isla. La guía está orientada tanto a jugadores noveles en Neverwinter Nights 2 como a jugadores provinientes de Neverwinter Nights 1 como a jugadores veteranos de Neverwinter Nights 2; en ella podréis encontrar información básica (como conectaros en modo multijugador, conceptos básicos de un mundo persistente de rol, primeros minutos en la Isla de los Grifos, etc...) hasta información específica de refencia sobre clases, listas de conjuros, etc... Por supuesto nuestro foro ( Link ) es la herramienta más actualizada y con información más completa, donde podréis comunicaros tanto con desarrolladores como con jugadores. Además, disponemos de un chat integrado donde podéis preguntar vuestras dudas al instante, donde la amable y solícita comunidad isleña os ayudará encantada a resolverlas.\n\n Sin más, esperar que os divirtáis en la Isla o en cualquier otro mundo persistente de NWN2\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nIn english:\n\nSpanish PW \"La Isla de los Grifos\"\n\nName of PW: La Isla de los Grifos\nWebsite: laisladelosgrifos.game-host.org\nCategory in Gamespy: Roleplay\nExpansions Requred To Play: MotB (SoZ is optional but fully recommended)\nAutoDownLoader: Yes\nStyle of Play: Heavy Roleplay\n\n Griffin Island is a spanish Neverwinter Nights 2 persistent world based in the old RuneQuest PnP campaign. It's a free access world online since 2 years and a half ago (not counting the initial year of development) created following this master guidelines:\n\n - It's a world heavily based on the original module, with some modifications we made in the PnP campaign.\n - A low-magic game engine modified to offer higher realism and balance than the NWN2 original one (always under our perspective, of course).\n - A custom play system to enforce and reward roleplay over hack and slash.\n - Modified ruleset to try to bring closer the base D&D model to RuneQuest's (at least to the version of RuneQuest we used to play in PnP).\n - High amount of secrets and areas to discover (some of them still unrevealed after almost 3 years online), using your wit or a wide range of skills and capabilities (not only kill the guardian on the entrance).\n\n We believe also that atmosphere and immersion is one of the critical factors in a PW, so we have spend a lot of efforts on them. Specifically, you can find hundreds of references ingame in addition to the rich Background section in our forums. For our player's comfort and as a sample of the detail level we offer in the Island, we have published a complete Background Guide ( laisladelosgrifos.game-host.org/forum/guias/1.pdf , in spanish only) where you can find from ancient history of Glorantha (the world where the server is set) to a creature compedium, interpretation guidelines for the different magic approaches, etc...\n\n Of course, we have used many of the new tools available in NWN2 to offer systems and a customization level impossible to reach in NWN1. As examples we shall mention:\n\n - Talent system: in addition to the several prestige classes and general feats we have created in the server, we have introduced talent trees for all the base classes (actually half of them are 100% implemented). Through the use of Role Points you can advance in the trees and obtain new powers and abilities which will improve your character in the direction you want.\n\n(some links to images)\nimg30.imageshack.us/img30/4048/uiguerrero.png\nimg838.imageshack.us/img838/321/uipicaro38.jpg\nimg833.imageshack.us/img833/554/uimago41.jpg\n\n - Merchant system: have you ever wished become a real merchant with your own exclusive articles which you can elaborate and sell following your own criteria, without the need of DM provisioning, through a completely automated system that allows you to experience the sensation of being a real trader? Welcome to the Griffin Island's Merchant system :)\n\n - Quality Equipment system: buy or find weapons, armors and shields of different qualities and ask a smith to customize it accordingly to your needs.\n\n - A vast quantity of small systems that change completely the gameplay experience, like Saturation (auto-regulation of potion ingestion), free creation of magical wands and staffs (with any spell available and stackable), Track and Sense Magic (to follow beasts tracks and supernatural presences) and many more...\n\n For a full resume there's available a complete Player Guide ( laisladelosgrifos.game-host.org/forum/guias/2.pdf , in spanish only, monthly updated) with all the necessary to start playing and all the existent systems in the Island. The player guide is directed to new Neverwinter Nights 2 players as well as players coming from Neverwinter Nights 1 or veteran Neverwinter Nights 2 players; there you can find from basic info (how to access multiplayer, basic concepts of roleplay PWs, first minutes in the Griffin Island, etc...) to specific reference information about classes, spell lists, etc... Of course our forum is the most updated tool that contains every piece of information and where you will be able to communicate with developers and players. We also provide a inline chat where you can ask for all your doubts right away and where the kind and attentive islanders community will be glad to help to solve them.\n\n We hope you get fun in the Island or any other NWN2 PW!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"248":{"Name":"Eye of the World","Author":"Kanbyen","Submitted":20100926,"Updated":20110507,"Category":"In Development","Website":"bonzoli.com/drupal","Number Players":"30","Death Type":"Exp and Gold loss.","Races":"All MotB and SoZ Races.","Classes":"All MotB and SoZ Classes.","LevelRange":"1-30","NumberServers":"1","Schedule":"None","NumberDMS":"2","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Tricks Traps":"Medium","RolePlay":"Medium","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Treasure":"Dependant on Players efforts","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Players efforts","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Full PvP","Connection":"DSL","Content Rating":"Everyone","NumberAreas":"100-500","Description":"Eye of the World \n\nPersistent Neverwinter Nights 2 server update:\nWebsite: http://bonzoli.com/drupal\n\nCome Check us out.

There generally 1000+ Dwarfs \nin this area but usually at one time there are \nmuch fewer in the city itself since most spread\nout to their individual holdings in tunnels and \nmust take their merchandise to other holds and the\nsurface for sale. They specialize in dwarven rune\nblades and armor here. They were never considered\nthe very best at creating armor but they were easily\nbetter then a surfacers blade on average and are\nquite prized by other holdings. These dwarfs are\nalso just waking up to the fact that their areas are\nnot what they knew. Most of the people that were to \nfar away when the earthquake collapsed the crevices \nand most caves around this area just after the keepers\nmoved they whole mountain to this plane are not \nreturning. There are also new incursions of various\ncreatures that have never been know to inhabit this\narea and its quite a bit more dangerous now to venture\ninto the mines. Even though the gates are still safe\nthe constant battle is becoming the norm. Some \nresources are now more expensive and food is a more \nscarce since the land is different on the surface. With\nthe discovery though of a new Sea inlet at the bottom \nof the crevices north end has lead to a great deal more\nblind fish and water meats. But this has also lead to\nseveral encounters with dark elves, goblins, deep gnomes\nand the dwarven dark brotherhood dwarfs. There are \nstill several thousand dwarfs in this holding but the\ndeath rate now exceeds the birth rate and several of the \nleaders and clans are calling for a fulls scale war on \nthe dark elves who harass their miners at every turn. \nPerhaps some allies can be found with the new human city \nor elves to the west to help secure those directions. \nHumans can not be trusted to keep their word and \nnegotiations with this countess blackthorn has given \nseveral of the most stout dwarfs with a deep fear \nand disquiet that something is not right with this human. \n\n------","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"250":{"Name":"Legacy II: Dark Age of Britain","Author":"Troy47","Submitted":20101206,"Updated":20120728,"Category":"Roleplaying","Forum Thread":"Link","Website":"Link","Death Type":"Story Permadeath (with post-perma new character starting bonuses), lenient PvE system","Length":"Endless.","Setting":"Custom","Alignments":"No Alignments.","Races":"Humans only.","Classes":"All Custom Classes:\nWarrior\nRogue\nMedrus","LevelRange":"2-8","NumberServers":"1","Schedule":"All times","NumberDMS":"6","Application Reqs":"For certain starting races/origins.","House Rules":"See forums and wiki","Language":"English","Scope":"Large","Tricks Traps":"Light","RolePlay":"Heavy","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Treasure":"Low","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","Vault Type":"Server","PvP":"Mixed","Connection":"Cable","Content Rating":"Mature","NumberAreas":"100-500","Description":"Legacy II: Dark Age of Britain is here!\n\nReturn to the highest rated NWN2 PW with all new features and an expanded game world.

Duranin is home to the ruins of a forgotten, ancient civilization called the Yvas, and the dark secrets that were buried with their people. Old evils have been biding their time in this frigid north, infiltrating the populace and manipulating history to serve their interests. The enigmatic Fair Folk roam the western forests of Duranin, playing their fey tricks on common men, many whom are never heard from again. Powerful guilds and a church that seemingly answers to no-one challenge the will of a young queen barely in her fourteenth year, after the brutal murder of her father. Ancient forces of good, evil, and everything inbetween roam the edges of this wild and forgotten land, as the good people of Duranin struggle to survive the ghosts of the ancient past, and the ambitions of it�s future.\n\nIt is the bold, and the brave, who will have a hand in shaping the fate of Duranin.\n\nDuranin is a Neverwinter Nights 2 persistent campaign, not just a persistent world; what this means is, the world grows and changes with an evolving story over time, through DM quests, events, and story arcs, much like a tabletop pen-and-paper game. A persistent campaign is not like an MMO; it's a world where the most important thing you can do is roleplay your character, and are rewarded for doing so exceptionally.\n\nDuranin is currently open to the public, though new features and gameplay systems are being added all the time.

However, it is reserved for an adult audience as the themes, in addition to conventional social modules, are bleak.\n\nThe module has its roots in two games, Warhammer and Warhammer 40000. Thus issues such as corruption or gore are used. Beware however to not to go too far, the rules of mod protecting players from abuse.\n\nThe game system is based on players actions. Even if two NPCs are there to lead in the absence of PCs (and thus avoid a paralysis of the mod) the purpose is to lead the political, religious and economic by pcs.\nThus, laws exist but can be changed.\nSeveral organizations are planned but it will be possible to create his own faction. Note that the DM have not and will not have faction leader characters.\n\nThe trading and craft system is based on the CNR. It will be important to discuss for the resources needed to create spells and some items.\n\nFurthermore the mod has many additional classes and new powers and spells for existing classes.\n\nThe background:\n\nIn the south of the Forgotten Realms was a powerful kingdom, Laguarda. Very tolerant it was a haven for those suffering from exclusion. Protected by its guards and its elite troops it seemed invincible but ...\nFor two years the Nordens coalition, made up of creatures all the more monstrous than the others attacked the kingdom. Like a cancer the coalition corrupted everything it touched, turning brother against brother, showing to the fighters a new form of war, terrible beyond anything they could imagine ...\nLaguarda held but suddenly athe Nordens attacked and crushed everything in their path. In only a week the proud Laguarda was engulfed in the flames of the Norden corruption. The guard, the elite troops, nothing helped.\nCivilians fled south and wandered into a plan near Toril where they tried to re learn how to live.\nThree months later, some questions still have no answers: Why did the Nordens defeated them so quickly? What is their purpose? Will they come back?

Our goal is to make a living breathing world, where a person's actions effect the course of history. We try to stay as close to pen and paper Dungeons and Dragons as is possible in an online world. \n\nBeldin does not follow 4.0 Fearunian history.\n\nUpdate as of 3/31/2012: Beldin has recently added in rideable horses! They are available for beta testing by anyone who wants to buy one.\n\nThe Story\nBeldin is in the far north of the Forgotten Realms, west of Luskan and south of the Spine of the World. The city is built at the mouth of a river sometimes labled the 'Iceflow' on old Fearunian maps, but known by its inhabitants as the Karen. This area by rights ought to be tundra, but the Karen Valley has long been kept warm by means of ancient magic, and protected by the might of the adventurers who come to her aid. The north is a dangerous place, and powerful magic draws all manner of beings wishing to tap into its power.\n\nBeldin has been at war for most of its history with the goddess Auril, who despises the warmth of the valley amidst her cold and desolate northern lands. But the Winter Wars ended decades ago with the taking of Astrid Rock--long a bastion of Aurilite power in the Karen Valley. The Knights of Beldin who helped to defeat Auril and take Astrid Rock built a castle there to keep the north safe from further Aurilite incursions. But with the threat of Auril gone, enemies began to appear from within the kingdom itself. Atamara of the house of Nightshade was chosen by Shar as her high priestess in the valley, and her chosen instrument in bringing about the fulfillment of the Dark Prophecies--ancient Sharran texts which predicted the end of the world coming with the opening of a portal to the Abyss which had long been kept sealed and hidden in the Karen Valley.\n\nThe Sharran plots were foiled, however, with the premature opening of that portal by the witch Mystera. Hordes of demons poured through the portal into the valley, but were eventually beated back by the Knights and adventurers of the Karen. There followed fifteen years of peace in the kingdom. But old enemies still lurked in the Karen Valley, biding their time, waiting to strike, and Beldin will always need its adventurers. . .\n\nThe story is driven by Beldin's DM sessions, which take place every night of the week, 9 p.m. Central Time (GMT -6). Beldin has four active DM's, so you can expect a variety of quest genres and DM'ing styles.\n\nLog in and check us out!

In fact� we've probably been a bit over ambitious, I mean we're launching with three servers and that's still without all the planned expansion content we have. I imagine we have everything, looking for a certain kind of RP? It'll be around here somewhere, even if it's secret or scheduled to be introduced in an expansion. Want to role-play a megalomaniac seahorse which shoots poetry out of its eyes? Then you're blatantly trying to point out we don't really have every kind of RP, quiet you. \nAt SOV we've always aimed to make a living, breathing world where players don't sit around waiting for a DM to appear, where counting the days to the next event isn't needed because there is so much going on with the players themselves. Where the conflict between players be it martial, social, political, romance-driven, competitive, mercantile-based or otherwise drives the world and the world changes in response. \nI should also point out that because we're a completely custom setting we can do that, change, and we're not afraid too either. Oh don't get me wrong, you'll have to work for your change, but we don't intend to stop players from becoming kings or guilds leaders, if they try hard enough~ we'd like to leave as much control in the hands of the players as possible. What's more by being a custom setting we can really cut down on those pesky arguments about the application of exterior lore. \nWhat's that? With all this talk of players driving the world will there still be DM initiated events? Of course there will be, we aren't going to get rid of that~ in fact we have several expansions and events planned that'll make for a very interesting first year� well I hope they will anyway, we don't know because you, the players, will be deciding the outcome. If you decide to, and somehow succeed at, solving all the world's problems through some kind of ceramic painting club I guess we'll all get rather bored.\nAnyway, we're an ambitious bunch who have managed to stay working on this server through over a year of development, enjoy the fruits of our labour. Oh, and don't forget to check out our forums and wiki! \n\nWorld Description\nTyvaren, a continent ever picking at the scabs of its long and bloody history, a continent beholden to gods, magic and devils, a continent which beyond all else, lies divided. \nTo the cold and bitter north stands Grand Tyria, a nation built upon foundations of human supremacy, landed aristocracy, mind over matter and the rule of law. It is ruled over by its founder, Morded the immortal, who was banished from Tyria's father nation over 450 years ago. The father nation was the Kingdom of Eathos, which to this day reigns over Tyvaren's fertile southwest, upholding a culture of honour, physical prowess and equality. Though the events which separated the two nations were far from black and white each nation has long seen the other as a betrayer and tensions have grown high. The time may soon come when the two nations risk a war which could draw into it all the nations of Tyvaren; including the dwarves of the northwest mountains, the eastern wood elves and the desert dwelling gnomes. \nBut for some, the worst wars have already come to pass; the once tranquil Halfling race was driven out of its homeland over four centuries ago by Tyvaren's newest race, the Orcs, who pose a continual threat to both the Kingdom of Eathos, the wood elves and even those beyond them.\nHowever Orcs are but one threat eating away at the hearts of Tyvaren's mortals, one of many. The pirates and scoundrels of the island of Ineos whisper of missing ships and a growing shadow in the west; The enslaved descendants of natives killed, imprisoned and driven out of the north by Grand Tyria foster rumours of stirring wildfolk to its east; And above all else the three thousandth year draws nigh, preceded by omens, prophecy and uncertainty.

They defended Cormyr alongside their loyal troops until they fell to a foe whose hatred for their nation was born from untold centuries of suffering.\n\nMad with grief and loss, an elf wizard named Lorelei Alvara, whose love had been slain by the first king of Cormyr, swore vengeance on the Obarskyr name and all humans within Cormyr. Human wizards managed to imprison her over 1,000 years ago.\n\nSince then, Nalavara or the Devil Dragon (as the elf-dragon came to be known) sought a way to break free from her extradimensional prison. She brought Grodd, a city of goblins located in the same extradimensional space as her prison, to a level of civilisation unheard of among goblinkind. She also created the magical horrid winged creatures known as Ghazneths from long-dead members of Azoun's family who had betrayed Cormyr in some way and unleashed them on the kingdom. Able to absorb even the most powerful of spells, faster than the eye with the ability to sense magic hundreds of miles away, strength enough to crush a man to a pulp and with the only means of killing them by removing their curse, these creatures ravaged the kingdom, decimated the War Wizards and rendered all magic useless and suicidal. \n\nUnlike Nalavara, the goblins of Grodd were able to move freely between Toril and the extradimensional prison and she dispatched them to attack the lands of Cormyr in preparation for her own return. \n\nAzoun IV, Alusair, and the forces of Cormyr suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of the otherworldly goblins and the Ghazneths, who had also been joined by orcs from the Stonelands to the North of the kingdom. Nalavara finally broke free of her prison, and the 600 foot dragon joined her forces, having been inadvertently freed by the magic of Vangerdahast, Cormyr's Royal Wizard, who was temporarily trapped with her. \n\nArabel and the surrounding lands quickly fell to their might, and the army retreated towards Suzail with the hope of fending off the onslaught long enough to provide enough time for the citizens of Cormyr to evacuate the kingdom. \n\nHowever, through the efforts of King Azoun, his daughters (Tanalasta and Alusair), Vangerdahast, and a host of brave warriors, Cormyr was saved and the ancient evil of Nalavara the Devil Dragon was ended.\n\nThe victory was not without cost. The struggle cost both Azoun IV and Tanalasta their lives, along with most of Cormyr's army (the Purple Dragons), and many loyal nobles and War Wizards. Only through extreme measures was Tanalasta's child saved as life fled from her body. The babe, a boy named Azoun V, is the next king of Cormyr.\n\nNow, wild-hearted Alusair, renowned for her prowess at arms and indomitable will, sits upon the throne as a reluctant Regent, ruling on behalf of her infant nephew until the boy comes of age. Many nobles and merchants do not believe Alusair can be trusted with the reins of power, even if Vangerdahast advises her as well as he advised her father.\n\nThe events of recent months have pushed this once peaceful, well-ordered kingdom to the verge of anarchy. \nCormyr is now a hotbed of intrigue, as regent loyalists, power-hungry conspirators, misguided patriots, monstrous foes, and sinister forces from beyond Cormyr's bodrs rush to secure their positions and undermine their enemies. \n\nThe people of Cormyr need protection from elements of their own nobility who test Alusair's power, the avaricious nation of Sembia to the east, foes that have sought to take advantage of the weakened state of the Kingdom, and the remnants of Nalavara's forces that helped bring low the Kingdom. \n\nAlusair has sent messengers to surrounding lands, promising riches and land for helping drive back the remnant forces from Arabel and the Kings Forest. Rumours of a now unguarded dragon lair and its inevitable hoard of treasure, somewhere in or near Cormyr, draw an ever-growing number of treasure seekers to the forest country as well. \n\nAs a result, Cormyr is a magnet for adventurers and mercenaries of all stripes, possibly for years to come. \n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"271":{"Name":"Myth Drannor: The Second Age","Author":"Kirin","Submitted":20121121,"Updated":20121123,"Category":"Roleplaying","Website":"Link","Number Players":"50+","Setting":"Forgotten Realms 3.5 Edition","Alignments":"All","Races":"All basic, plus custom upon requests.","Classes":"Full implimentation of Kaedrin's PrCs","NumberDMS":"6","Application Reqs":"Only for certain races or classes.

The very name is echoed throughout the halls of history. The heart of the Cormanthor and the old elven civilization that once dwelt within, Myth Drannor and her secrets have been coveted by factions across the land for centuries.\n\nFifteen years ago, in the year 1375 by Dale-reckoning, an alliance of elves and men, halflings and dwarves, gnomes and half-bloods came together to free the city from the clutches of evil once and for all. They stood victorious in the wake of battle, driving back fiends, the Zhentarim, Hillsfar, and any else who dared use the city's ancient secrets for ill.\n\nTheir victory was short-lived.\n\nEnraged by what they regarded as a betrayal of their ceasefire, the Zhentarim struck, tearing open great planar gates within the ancient city, unleashing an army from the Abyss. Overwhelmed and facing certain defeat, a defiant elf by name of Immril Shadowsbane made a desperate act to prevent the Zhentarim or the Tanar'ri from claiming the city; he made a deal with the devils of Baator, ancient enemies of the Tanar'ri, and sparked a new Blood War within the ancient city's walls. A war that still rages to this day. Though some regard him as hero and others villain, Immril's actions have ensured that once again, the secrets of Myth Drannor are locked away from the grasp of the mortal world.\n\nAs the years passed and the city faded into legend once more, change has swept over the Dales. Harrowdale, once a small port town, has grown to a bustling city and center for commerce. Scardale, never recovering from the shame of their occupation by the other Dales thirty years ago, has grown it's army by multitudes and once again threatens it's neighbors. To the north, the Zhentarim and Hillsfar are at each other's throats, but both have their eyes on Dales territory to the south. And all throughout the Cormanthor, hanging on the lips of men and dwarves, are rumors that the elves are returning to the land.\n\nThe year is 1390 DR. Shadows and light fight for the future of the Dales, and for the fate of Myth Drannor itself.\n\nWhere will you stand?\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n- HUGE seamless world, with no world maps, stretching from Ashabenford to Harrowdale.\n- A bold new chaper in the 3rd-Edition timeline, with no Spellplague and the same Gods and races you know and love.\n- Full implimentation of Kaedrin's PRC, spell, and feat content.\n- A mature-rated server for adults, where you may pursure darker or more sexual character themes.
