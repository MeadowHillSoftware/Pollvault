But there are forces at work trying to stop you - and, even within your own party, all is not as it seems...","Description":"***STORY TEASER***\n\nA thousand years ago, the northern lands of Rasheman were laid to waste by the destructive rampages of an enraged demon. Only with great courage and sacrifice were the Witches and a group of adventurers able to stop the fiend. Even then, however, they had not the power to kill the creature or send it to the lower planes; some aspect of its vast power was attuned to the essence of Toril. So they bound it to rest for a thousand years, hoping that, over that long space of time, someone would come up with a way to banish it from Rasheman forever. But, as the years passed by and the demon slept, its threat was forgotten by all but a few...\n \nNow, the thousand years are nearly over, and the ancient magic binding the demon is almost spent. The threat is real again. Should the demon break free, not only could Rasheman be devastated - if the Red Wizards take advantage of the time of chaos and carnage, all the eastern lands could be conquered. Rarely has there been a greater danger to the Unappoachable East. Accordingly, a number of people with an interest in protecting Rasheman have gathered together, in the hope of ending this threat forever.\n\nOne of the guardians of the demon's prison has heard of a ruined site in the Rawlinswood with a cross-planar teleportation chamber powerful enough to banish the demon from Toril, once and for all. Using a magic crystal as a focus for the imprisoning spell, it will be possible to bring the demon to the gate - but only if you act now. The prison guardian has asked for help in this endeavour, and a number of folk have responded to this call - including yourself. \n\nBut, as you make ready to set out on your journey with the bound and subdued demon in tow, you feel an unnerving sense of danger. Not just from the glowing red eyes beneath the hood of the hulking, cloaked creature (that is to be expected), nor only from the Red Wizards (who will surely try to foil your quest). No, this is something else. You cannot help but feel that the greatest danger to this mission is nearer than you think, and you may not see it until it is too late - for yourself, for Rasheman, for everyone...\n\n***COMMENTS***\n\nThis is based on a once-off game I wrote and ran at a games convention three years ago. The natural conflict lines in the party of PCs aided roleplaying a lot - so that even a newbie who'd never played a roleplaying game of any kind before was really drawn into it: along with the rest of the group, she ended up acting her character's role very well, and played a central part in the final resolution of the plot. \n\nAccordingly, I think that this could make for a very involving story if adapted for Neverwinter Nights (1 or 2). The original members of the party would be the travelling companions of the PC. As for the PC him/herself, a conversation at the start of the game would allow him/her to select a background and general philosophy. This would be a starting point for the numerous conversations over the course of the adventure during which the PC's personality will come into play. The companions also have their own philosophies and priorities; some of these will provide steep challenges for the PC. By the end of the game, there will almost certainly be some severe disagreements within the party as to how to complete their mission - and the PC's choices will be pivotal in determing the final outcome of the adventure (there will be multiple possible endings).\n\nIn addition to the strong role-playing element of this module, there will be numerous opportunities for combat. The PC and his/her companions will face a variety of foes in fast-paced and furious fight scenes (some info on their opponents is given in the spoiler section). In some cases, where they face particularly devious and ingenious enemies, forward planning and careful tactics will be required to succeed. (Some of the possible endings of the module that would not otherwise come into play will do so if they lose these important battles.)\n\n***SPOILERS***\n*\n***DO NOT READ IF YOU INTEND TO PLAY THIS MOD***\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nThe description above is suitable for players, as it contains no spoilers. However, in order not to miss out on the central mystery of the adventure, which gives the main opportunity for roleplaying, I wish to add a few pertinent points (with some additional notes on combat):\n\n1) The \"demon\" the party is trying to send to the lower planes is actually a half-celestial who was tortured and experimented on by fiends (leading to her current horrid appearance). She laid waste to Rasheman a thousand years ago when she escaped from her evil captors, and did not realise what she had done until she had been stopped and was imprisoned.\n\n2) The guardian of the prison-tomb is aware of the Prisoner's identity - but he still want to send her to the hells. He knows she cannot stay in Toril, but feels her corruption (from the fiends' torture) would be a threat to the heavens.\n\n3) Another companion knows her real identity, and wants to imprison her as revenge against another member of the party (and, depending on the PC's background choices, possibly the PC).\n\n4) The rest of the party, including the PC, are oblivious to this central fact: but they all have various motivations that will come into play when the Prisoner's identity is revealed and they are forced to make their choice.\n\nIn addition, I think it best to mention some of the encounters the PC will face (some of which can be resolved without combat) here: in Rasheman, winter wolves, elementals, and nature spirits; at various points on the journey (and, finally, at the ruins), Red Wizards (with their bodyguards and undead minions); in the Rawlinswood, fey, animals, and forest guardians; and, at the planar gate where the adventure ends (provided they get that far - the story can end in other ways), angels and demons. This should help to give an idea of the feel and flavour of combat that the adventure will offer.","Rating":8.68,"Votes":12,"Awards":[]},"26":{"Name":"Mortality","Author":"Snowy","Submitted":20061031,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Single Player","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"When the gods fail, the world is left to the mortals.

The format is as follows. There would be a series of three modules that together would form a complete story. Each module would have a pre-made character that is directly involved with the plot, although through each module you never come in contact with the character you played previously, or will play (As a result of this format you could play the series in any order). Here is an example. In the world of Forgotten Realms a Human Paladin seeks out his long lost sister who used to fight beside him to protect his city from evil. One day his sister disappeared during an undead raid. Throughout this first module the Paladin adventures through the fantasy realm picking up clues to the whereabouts of his sister, while his city is left vulnerable without his courageous lead, putting the burden of time on his shoulders. He comes across a few events of particular note. He discovers that his sister has passed through a certain cavern system previously riddled with traps, but thanks to her fine rogue skills he makes it through safely. He then discovers later that his sister has discovered the one responsible for the attacks upon their city, and has gone to seek vengeance. But the brave Paladin finds out that she is now being hunted by a band of vicious assassins known as the Grim Ten. So to save her, he seeks out the Grim Ten before they can find his sister. On the flip side, the second module is about his sister who was driven to leave her city without explanation, because of a man who warned her of the dangers to come, and the imminence of their cities demise. She travels through the cavern system riddled with traps, unaware that it would save her brothers life, and she ultimately seeks out a powerful sorcerer who wants the magical artifacts the cities unknowingly carries beneath its rock surface, below the city center. She ends up finding and destroying that sorcerer, without the knowledge that her brother saved her life by fighting the Grim Ten. The final module could be about the mysterious nomad who warns her of the trouble to come�in reality he was once a servant of the powerful sorcerer. And in the module he escapes his rule to warn the city of their doom, when he realizes the evil of us way, perhaps sparked by the death of his own family, commanded by the evil sorcerer. So the third module is essentially about the wizard who escaped his rule, to warn the city, and to open the gates of the sorcerers castle to see that the Paladin�s sister�s way isn�t too battle heavy, being that she is only a rogue. That is an example story using the format of the Midquel.","Rating":6.5,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"41":{"Name":"It's Better to Burn Out Than to Fade Away.","Author":"eternal","Submitted":20061031,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Single Player","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"One man's rise to fulfill his destiny may turn out to be his greatest fall.","Description":"Like most epics this is a tale of an average everyday schmoe who is destined for greatness.

No true civilization has yet formed. The PC is the leader of one of these tribes and must see to the development of the tribe members and the formation of their first village. As different objectives are met new buildings (huts) will become available for the PC to have built. While seeing to the formation of the village the PC must also contend with surviving in an extremely hostile world where he must hunt for food and scavenge for resources. I developed a �hunger and thirst� set of scripts in the past that I will utilize in the mod. The PC is not alone in his efforts though, as he will be responsible for assigning \"jobs\" to the other tribe members based on the type of resources that can currently be gathered. Like any true city building game new buildings will become available as the PC progresses through the mod and maintaining a certain level of resources will be necessary to keep the tribe alive. With all this the PC is also in direct contact with the tribes god. Through completing quests for the god the PC will gain the knowledge and power to lead the tribe to success.\n\nThe first mod will deal with the founding of the village, exploration of the surrounding land, completing god quests, and finishes when the village has been fully established, and optionally all side quests finished. The village starts off with a �main camp� area and the PC must see that several other buildings are erected around it including: \n\nHunters Hut: handles food (meat) resource\n\nForge Hut: handles tools and weapons\n\nTanners Hut: handles armor\n\nWalls: Built to help keep out enemies.\n\nShrine: Place for tribe to worship their god (story element)\n\nThere are a few other buildings not listed here.\n\nFrom there future mods will add more story elements, including other gods, expansion of territory, and relations with other tribes, human or otherwise, will be woven into the tale. Future mods featuring expansion stories will be similar to the first, I�ll have the PC establish a second village, an inn between them, and a camp for nearby resources, a third village, another inn, and another two camps for resources. Somewhere in between there the first resource camp will develop into a village too. That�s for the future though, and each could be a seperate mod moving the main story along.\n\nThis is a low magic world to begin with. PC's and NPC's will develop magical items as the story unfolds. Eventually I forsee a second set of mods telling the story of the village developing into a hamlet and eventually a city, then the capitol of a nation. Meanwhile various stories will develop shaping the world of Alither for good and evil. I plan to have the PC play a direct descendent of the original PC, but that isn't written in stone. Who ever the PC plays in future parts of the story he/she will always just happen to be in charge of the development of some outpost or new city, thus keeping with the RPGCIV design. Really this is a simulation of a CIV game because the spots buildings are built on are predetermined. I don�t plan on having the PC be able to actually pick the place a building will go up. Though if this were ever an easy thing to do I wouldn�t prohibit it. Right now I�ll have a map for each version of the village and the maps will change as the village changes.\n\nI want to create an RPG with city building elements. It will be a game where as the village develops the PC is running around in it witnessing the changes firsthand. As new buildings go up and the village grows it should help give the village more of an identity that the PC can relate to. I want to move to not only NPC's with more personality that the PC can relate to but also the village as an ally, not just some background place that the PC supposedly calls home. If the PC leaves on some quest and the village is attacked while he�s gone and some buildings are destroyed this will now effect the PC more since he was directly responsible for the building being built.\n\nThis is officially my first NWN 2 project, though it looks like I'll have to wait to see if boots and bracers can be removed, and the standard underclothes can be changed to something more \"savage\". Having a �Dawn of Time� mod where the tribe wears these kinds of clothes at the beginning seems silly. \n\nI see these series of mods as a chance to start a new world from scratch. A world where when a person plays a future mod and talks with an NPC about an ancient war he/she will have actually played through the war as a different character, possibly that PC�s ancestor.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.\nbiggislims\n","Rating":7.45,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"45":{"Name":"Mage Wars","Author":"Daja","Submitted":20061031,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Persistent World","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Magic Wars between different books","Description":"Okay, so I was reading a book the other day and I thought it would be . . . interesting to see what would happen if all of those characters from differect books were in NWN2 (cause not enough placeables in NWN) battling with each other to see who the best was. ^^.

Fivelands, once five separate kingdoms, has suffered upheaval, with the sudden assassination of her King. The world, though not enormous, is laid out so that each player begins a goodly distance from one another, in a collection of areas with varying resources and natural features. Each of these regions, the ancient five kingdoms, has chosen a ruler, bent on ascending the Throne of Fivelands. Each player must garner public support for their claim to rule, gather armies, equipment, and supplies. Spies can be sent out, and assassins, to try to disrupt or scout enemy plans. Battles between the players are an integral part of the game, and with each successful engagement, more resources are gained by the victor. Final victory is ultimately achieved by force of arms, but purely combat oriented players will likely have a difficult time of things. Negotiation, wise treatment of the common folk, etc, goes a long way toward inspiring loyalty.

Perhaps in some ways more so because it's all new, and fresh, and truly sinks it's teeth into you once you give it a fair chance to do so... \n\nSo what are you waiting for? Vote for this idea, and lets see who's interested in making this idea happen!\n\nAs for the modules actual concept? Hahah... There is an entire untapped campaign setting out there waiting to be discovered and explored. A good module based on it would really showcase the new world and all it has to offer... Especialy it's gritty, Fantasy noir, indiana jones mood... \n\nImagine solving murders in the city of sharn one day, traveling on a lightning rail the next to chase your prey, winding up at the center of a horrible plot to destroy the world, and ending up facing your worst nightmares in the Mourneland... Imagine flying an Elemental Airship to new undiscovered places, and making your name known to the Dragon Marked houses... \n\nImagine truly discovering a new world full of endless possibility, where only a few have already tred...

The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an epic poem, now lost, written by Peisandros of Rhodes, dated about 600 BC.\nIn his labours, Hercules (or Heracles for the greeks) was often accompanied by a male companion (an eromenos), according to some Licymnius, or by others Iolaus, his nephew. Although he was only supposed to perform ten labours, this assistance led to him suffering two more. Eurystheus didn't count the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, or the Augean stables, as he received payment for his work (in other versions it is because the rivers did the work).\n\nA traditional order of the labours found in Apollodorus (2.5.1-2.5.12) is:\n\n1. Slay the Nemean Lion and bring back its fur. \n2. Slay the Lernaean Hydra. \n3. Capture the Ceryneian Hind. \n4. Capture the Erymanthian Boar. \n5. Clean the Augean stables in a single day. \n6.

Though the town it names hardly feels very welcoming. You have been brought here by rumors that have spread throughout the region. They speak of an old village deep in the forest that just simply wasn't there before. There are tales of missing farmers and watchmen. Search parties have been sent out but never returned. The wood elves speak of an ancient myth of a cursed village that vanished hundreds of years before without a trace. Actual details are sketchy, but the elder elves shudder at the telling of the tale and refuse to speak of it. Be it the lure of adventure, mystery, or undiscovered treasure you and other adventurers have been drawn to this bizarre village. It is unusual in design - the overall outline from the streets to the houses built to form a large spiral, going ever inwards and circling in on itself. Your heart beats fast in your chest as you step past the welcome sign and into the village. The next thing you know, you hear a loud rustling sound behind you. When you turn to look, the once straight path back into the forest is gone and all you see behind you is an ever expanding spiral of dirt road and trees. Walking back along this path only leads you back to the entrance. In the distance you hear the cries of tortured spirits and suffering people. And other noises you dare not try to think about. For whatever reason you came to this place, there is no turning back now. To solve the mystery of Ostarpela you must follow the spiral to it's center and pray you are ready to face what you find there.\"\n\nThe main idea behind this mod is facing the unknown. It should be playable whether you are alone or with a small group of friends, with potential henchman spread throughout the adventure to help those going alone. As you go further into the adventure the spiral moves downward, taking you from the cursed village down to caverns underneath it and even further down to places even the elves know nothing about. You will encounter:\n- Frightened villagers who have barricaded themselves in their homes and only speak to you through windows or doors. They are untrusting and scared to have anything to do with you, but you must somehow get information from them to find out what is happening.\n\n- Villagers and fellow adventurers caught in the grip of a madness centered around an obession with someone they only refer to as \"she\" or \"her\". Like an extremely advanced charm or love spell, they do \"her\" bidding without question and by any means necessary. The further you get in the adventure the more severe and fanatic these men will be. Whether \"she\" is responsible for the curse or a result of it is unknown, but only the strongest of wills are able to withstand \"her\" charms, and even they may be succeptible if within \"her\" presence for very long.\n\n- The restless dead: victims who have fallen to the curse in one form or another. The spiral curse has killed many in different and twisted ways and their suffering spirits or bodies remain in the town, unable to find peace. Most will be hostile, but those in tune with the spiritual world may be able to communicate with some or perhaps save their tortured souls.\n\n- Monsters created by the curse. Be it physically altered people or otherworldly beings who have been pulled into the spiral, you will encounter many bizarre and frightening creatures that will bar your path.\n\n- Puzzles and obstacles: the nature of the spiralling path means you will not always find a clear path ahead of you. The village itself will try to bar your way and you must find keys to locked doors and ways to create paths through blocked areas in order to continue.","Rating":5.81,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"69":{"Name":"The Fangs of Tiamat","Author":"Baeltor","Submitted":20061101,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Epic quest to stop the Queen of Wyrms","Description":"The idea is based on an old DnD 2nd Ed item from a Dragon Magazine issue.

Each dagger adds it powers, ie returning when thrown and bonuses to hit/ damage, to the new sword. The greatswords primary purpose is to open a portal to the Abyss and release Tiamat into the world. The adventure would be aimed at stopping a powerful priest and his followers from finding and uniting the lost Fangs. My original attempt (Before my hard drive and backups went toasty) was to place the player at a hamlet that was soon to be ravaged by an orc horde led by Arginal the Red (the priest). As the horde razes the hamlet, the priest plunders a forgotten hero's tomb and retrieves one of the daggers. The player, as one of the few survivors and the only living soul to have seen Arginal is brought before the local ruler. (I had not settled on an exact setting.) The lord and his elven wizard advisor tasks the player to stop Arginal and recover the daggers. The four remaining daggers should be scattered around the realm in inhospitable and daunting locations.

Clues on the locations would be hinted, directly or indirectly at times, by the elven wizard who is a gold dragon that has been watching over the fangs location for ages. The enemy would be working to gain these daggers at the same time, so it would be possible for the player to only gain a few of the daggers.

It is also noted that books, letters, scrolls, and other written items are accepted as donations. Passing through the door the PC finds a large library room with many sizes of comfortable chairs. Sitting in the chairs are various types of characters from throughout the known planes. There are always a couple of seats open.

Could this be thier Final Act?","Description":"The player (or players) take on the role of an actor. The premise is that your characters class will relate to whatever type of role he or she takes. For example, a warrior character will not actually be a warrior, but one with skills gained from playing warrior characters. Likewise, magic using characters will have gained their skills and spells from performing special effects for the plays. This will only be as a back story, no actaully acting will take place.\n\nSeveral plots can be derived from this, here are two i have thought up:\n\n1. The troupe is rehersing for a production, when it is descovered that an extra has been found murdered, mutilated in a way similar to several other killings that have happened recently. This leads the player(s) on a journy to descover the identity of the killer, which will take them through dungeons, mansions, etc, right up to a grand climax probably featuring someone you wouldnt expect. Or something.\n\n2. The actors are a traveling troupe, and one day, when traveling through an outlying village, are mistaken for an actual band of adventurers, and are asked to slay something/rescue someone. This in turn leads to further events, possibly involving a bandit group who they have angered. Standard fantasy movie plot.\n\nThis would be a module offering alot of humor, though not of a style that would take away from the gaming experiance.

The player is wearing only regular, street clothes, and has no equipment. However, if the player searches the room, he/she will find a rusty short sword and a quarterstaff. There is one large oaken door leading out of the room. \n\nOnce the player exits the room, he/she will find him/herself in a large hallway with strong oaken doors on both sides. There are several zombies wandering about in this hall who will immediately attack the player.\n\nIf the player loots the zombies (as he/she should), he/she will find that each zombie is wearing a strange amulet covered in weird runes. Each zombie will also have a few Gold Pieces.\n\nAfter killing the zombies, the player will have the opportunity to explore the staring area a little bit. The area is a large basement, winecellar, or storage facility of some kind. There are coffins everywhere. In one of the rooms nearest to the player (which are all similar to the room the player \"woke up\" in), the player will encounter an NPC sitting on the edge of a coffin. At first glance, this NPC appears to be badly injured. However, when the player approaches, he jumps up and screams \"Stay away from!\" or something like that. Dialogue now ensues. \n\nThe player and this NPC speak, and ultimately learn that they are, in fact, both dead (having been \"sliced up\", or \"run through\" several times each). Neither the player, nor the NPC can remember who they are; where they come from; or how they were killed; and they certainly have no idea how they got where they are now. However, each character is wearing a strange amulet identical to the ones that the player looted off the \"dead\" zombies.\n\nThe two characters agree to join up (the NPC becomes your first henchmen) to rediscover their pasts; solve the mystery of their deaths; figure out how/why they were reanimated; and find a way to reverse the process (or maybe just get some payback on whoever is responsible).\n\nWandering around the starting area, the player should encounter a whole bunch more zombies, as well as several more people who woke up on \"The Wrong Side of the Pillow.\" However, these people should be crazed or inconsolable (and therefore, of little help to the player). The player should also find some basic gear and/or loot. \n\nThe module should have a lot of dialogue (at least, initially). The player should have to speak with lots of folks in the area immediately outside of the starting area (a large port city, perhaps) to gain some clues on where to go next to begin to solve the mystery.\n\nUltimately, the clues the player gathers should lead him/her around the second area/port city (once they get out of the basement), through a few different towns (requiring a fair amount of \"cross county\" travel past patrols of clerics and/or paladins out looking to rid the world of the undead menace), to the player's home town, where the player will get the important clues that will enable him/her to solve the mystery. There should be some good dialogue here, as the player will meet up with people who know him; his friends; etc. - all of whom should be visibly shaken by the sight of their zombified friend.\n\nThis is just a basic concept. But I think there are some cool things that can be done with this. I'm not sure how this would be programmed, but the characters should initially appear to be regular, live people - albeit, somewhat pale, and sickly looking people. After a while, the players should start to rot. Their charisma (and probably all of their other abilities) should begin to drop. They should actually start to change into zombies. Maybe their eye falls out or their skin starts to peel. I don't know. Anyway - People should then begin to avoid them, give them quick answers (to get away from the smell), or even just run away in terror. This will make for an interesting challenge, because it will be much harder to get the answers the player needs. Plus, even though the player will be levelling-up (and gaining power), their stats will actually fall. \n\nI haven't figured out how the module will actually end yet (i.e., who is actually responsible for the whole mess), but I think its safe to say that whoever it is is an evil S.O.B. intent on world domination. Maybe he/she was planning on using the zombies as soldiers in his/her war against his rival. I don't know. In any event, gods/demons are probably involved, so there should be plenty of opportunity to fight tough boss-type enemies at the end. Maybe you get to choose whether to be returned to life, or continue on as a undead monster. Again - I don't know. I think somebody creative/talented could run with this thing and fill in the (many) blanks.","Rating":8.09,"Votes":10,"Awards":[]},"79":{"Name":"The Harpers(series)","Author":"Weasal","Submitted":20061103,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Other","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"The Whole Harpers Series","Description":"A series of Modules based on the Harpers Novels.

It's intended with a good craft sys, a different by city market, a good subrace sys, some spell scripts, guilds, fame points sys, different by area spells and religion, weather sys and what else to give a bit of custom taste to the game.\n\nBlondescape it's a world as big as our real world. At the very beginning of the world there were a lot of strange species (First Ceation Creatures) that turned bad following rebel god Tanarus then banished by other gods and get the wrath of the gods that decided to cover up the whole world with a fresh layer of mud condensed in the high atmosphere to kill all the bad creatures at once. In this way they created the underworld because the layer falling down from the air didn't fit well to the world crust expecially near the highest mountains and some magical places, in certain cases remaining floating over the world.\nThen gods then created some other creatures (Humans, Elves, Gnome, Dwarfs, Halflings , called Second Creation Creatures) to give balance and life again to the world.\nThe geography is similar to our world to be easier to orientate. Flyng pieces of land called Zollands are really common over the Americas, over the atlantic ocean, and over Australia and Micronesia and are inhabitated by thre different species of a strange winged race called Zollnars. \nThe bad fellows tend to be concentrated near mountains, because there are the places where \"bubble of air\" remained after the cataclysm before the Second Creation. So lots of scarred and desolated lands can be found around european, asian, american and african mountain chains. The history of the world is similar to ours, but it was influenced by the two Creations, so depending on places there are some differences about the cultures: For example since there was a lot of First Creation Creatures activity near alps, the roman empire could not develop like in our world, and the barbarian cultures spreaded more around europe unifying the empire under the name of Niblungar empire. The campaign take place in a period something in between the Middle Ages and Renessaince, with some steam tech discoveries (mainly in northern america; Africa tend to be a low populated place, with the exception of The Fertile Halfmoon (Egypt to Mesopotamia); Asia is Dominated By small empires with lots of differnt cultures mainly tribal or ancient driven cultures.\nPantheons vary from culture to culture, with only one common point, The god Tanarus and the Two creations. For example in Europe the main religion is a mixed pantheon with Greek-Roman and Nordic gods associated by similarity and with double names (Odin-Zeus, Thor-Volkanus for ex.); In asia there is a religion based on philosophy and ancient daemons (probably creatures from 1st Creation) and sages(early Heroes of the 2nd creation); in Africa there is a mixed religion with elements associated to Egyptian pantheon (Rafire, Amonair, Osirislight, Anubdarkness etc.); in Americas there are Nature gods (Animal, Plants, Landscapes); On zollands they have they own religion with a dedicated pantheon mainly with air element association. Magic is different in all the parts of the world, in europe is the basic D&D magic in other places there are differences mainly in names of the spells and in some effects; a particular one is the Technomancy used in the northern part of america mainly applied on strange objects steam or low tech mechanically operated.\nTransportation in Europe is peculiar they have an intricated channel network connecting all the main rivers, similarly they have one in America and in Asia.\nBig cities are mainly Paris (with a big Magic university and a big riverport on the Sein; Niblahar that is in the position of Berlin in our world; Praha, the guilds city; Londren (more or less to the east of our London by the sea) a big seaport and a commercial city; Mantua, a fortified city-state in italy with three big lakes around three sides of its fortifications (Mantova in our world Italy) with a lord known as the First Creation Creatures Bloodieast Slayer; The Double City, Wasin & Tong (made on two floating land over our world Washington), with beautiful bridges connecting the two parts and the headquarter of the Thecnomancy Guild; Airthax on the Zollnar mainland floating in the middle of our atlantic ocean; Peiking the biggest city in asia with the asian Magic university (at the same place of our Beijing in China; Faxan a Dwarf city in the middle of the highest asian mountains, carved in the stone, the most dangerous city of the world (because it is near high mountains = lots of 1st creation creatures activity) with the biggest market of the world; Thebe a great monumental Egyptian city;\n\nIf someone is interested to the idea please email me I have a lot more material ","Rating":6.63,"Votes":6,"Awards":[]},"97":{"Name":"A Time to Kill","Author":"Chris Daugherty","Submitted":20061108,"Updated":20061203,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Travel thru Time and the Realms finding lost artifact parts","Description":"Ever wanted to adventure with Elminster, before he was 'above all that'?

Imagine that you are the silent witness of your world�s last days. Everything that you know is going to disappear, and you share the same destiny. How is it, to know the answer to the final �when�? How the judged world looks like? How would you live your final hours?\n\nThe city of Tears has grown on the former glory of eons old fortress situated on lonely island somewhere As the so called �dark prophecy� was foretold, its towers, once soaring to the walls of heaven, fell to the very gates of hell. The streets strain with blood and fire. In one night the old name vanished. It happened seven hours after the first words were spoken. Ocean became so acidic, that the wood of ships in the port simply melted in a matter of seconds. The sizzle of burning ships was the first sign of coming judgment. Seven days later, the sky gone red, and the bloody clouds blocked the sun forever. The last night begun. From that time, seven full moons left to the final end. As in many such stories, strange names of fearless leaders, sky-breaking mages and ancient forces should appear here. But this tale shows the real face of dark prophecies. The pain that touches common people. Their efforts to pass through their lives with peace and good memories.\n\nThe main purpose of character entering this module is to live last seven months of his life in a way he will choose. He may sit on sidewalk and cry to the sky, asking �why me?!� or try to spend the time he was given in better way. The greatest skill of human beings is their ability to adapt to new environment. As the game�s rules changes, on the ruins of old organizations new ones emerge. Player will be given the opportunity to join and lead various guilds or find his own way through the shadowy streets as a lonely wolf. The following ones can be found in the city of tears:\n\nSteel Law Guild. Founded by remains of old imperial guards the Steel Law�s are protectors of those who�ll ask for it. They�re one of the smallest establishments in the city; however they are still respected as fearless warriors.\n\nLast Coin Guild. Created by the noble tradesmen of city of tears, this guild provides supplies for citizens, for good price. Good for them of course. As the only ones who have enough resources to trade, Last Coin fast grew up as one of the richest guild in entire city. It is said, that its high members live in gorgeous luxury, but it is rather hard to join their ranks. Because of such fame many would like to see Last Coin in ashes.\n\nDiJillo Family. A hermetic organization that controls the underground of ruined city. Its terrifying assassins are feared among every other organization, and its agile thieves assure good financial support. \n\nThe Red Brotherhood. Guild founded by the survivors of mages academy. Closed in the high tower of dead archmage, those adepts of the oldest craft are solving the mysteries of arcane magic.\n\nThere are also two guilds that cannot be joined, but are still important part of city�s life. \n\nThe Chemical Brothers. Three dwarfen siblings, who are the main creators of mechanical devices. They produce siege machineries and are obsessed by idea of producing flying machine, so they could escape from island. Their efforts fail so long, as the fourth brother crashed two streets further from point he started his �flight�.\n\nThe Monastery. Monks living in monastery believe that the city was punished by the gods for its former sins. They sell their healing herbs and a good word for a low price to everyone that asks for it.\n\n\nThese organizations (besides Monastery and Chemical Brothers) compete for the control of seven districts of ruined city. In single player, these guild wars will be an ad-on to the story line, giving player and his guild opportunity to increase income and broader their horizons. The point is that these battles will happen regularly, and player can be caught in the middle of fierce war, when dealing with his issues in district. In persistent world version of this idea, the guild battles with real players on each side, and lonely wolfs that can be just in the wrong place in wrong time, burst out into hot TeamvsTeam combat dimension. In both versions the income from controlled districts can be spend on new arms, siege machines, and npc recruits. One important thing is that in closed city there is limited number of forces that can be hired. In single player, better npc�s will require additional quest to complete before you can hire them. In pw�s best npcs will be bought on an open auction. The guild leader will have direct influence on what given npc warrior will carry into battle, as he can choose equipment for him from guild�s armory. After npc�s perish he returns to his �home�, leaving equipment on battlefield, where he can be hired again. As the city is completely separated, there will be limited amount of items. Forget the infinite shop resources. Here each item will be valued, even the worst old dagger, as it can be reforged to the bright new long sword. Back to main thread, these cpu-controlled characters will gain experience when killing opposing forces, so during the game play their value increase. When not in combat, npcs will rest in guild hall, and they can be assassinated by experienced murder. The guild halls are heavily protected, but it is said, that some DeJillo Family members would be capable of doing so. Here comes another module�s issue. Each guild provides best training and equipment they are specialized in. DeJillo trains best thieves and assassins and they best offer poison-covered daggers, flexible armors and traps. Last Coin provides best overall equipment and siege machines, but their training capabilities are at low level. Steel Law has talented armor and weapon smiths that create tough iron items, and they also give best warrior training. The Red Brotherhood specializes in magical education and tricks like eternal walls, orbs of displacement and various planar summoning wands. \nAs the war for supremacy begins, one basic question appears. Why we should spend so much, on so little? Why even weak up when the sun for few seconds timidly shines under the clouds, when the end is so close? The answer is up to you. \n","Rating":8.46,"Votes":26,"Awards":["ModuleIdeaWinner.jpg"]},"103":{"Name":"The Discontented Dead : Of Moldy Flesh and Rotting Teeth","Author":"Ali Karimi","Submitted":20061112,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Single Player","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Zombie must make ammends for an unjust life","Description":"A respectable and necessary job in any civilized society, the undertaker has an important role in his community.

Little is known about the island, except that a large battle took place here centuries ago involving the all but forgotten nation of Kannaph. The only evidence that the island was previously inhabited is a mournful tower jutting from the island's tallest hill.\n\nThe actual story starts approximately a month or two after the settlers have arrived on Talamath Island. Things seemed to be going all right at first, but many, including yourself. Have been becoming increasingly uneasy about the island. Dark forms move about in the moonlight, and some colonists have gone missing, and most recently, a slow undulation can be felt coming from deep below the island, like a constant tremor.\n\nYour character, as well as a couple other of your fellow colonists take it upon yourselves to investigate this mysterious island closer. Early on in your investigation, you discover in some caverns beneath the island a gem or crystal that allows you to speak with the dead (a nod to the classic �Pathways into Darkness� for the Mac). When you find a corpse, regardless of its age, so long as you have the gem in your inventory, you can start a conversation with it to further expose the plot. \n\nConveniently, there is an abundance of ancient crumbling corpses in these caverns. As you talk to them, (at least the ones who were not driven entirely insane before they died), you discover that these skeletons in rotted leather and rusted armor were members of an elite order of battlemages sent to destroy the necromancer, Talamath, who used this island as his sanctuary and staging ground for a massive army of undead (and other abominations). \n\nThe battlemages had been successful, to a point. While they were unable to destroy Talamath, they were able to magically seal him in the very lowest bowels of his sanctuary, at the cost of each and every one of their lives.\n\nIt was also discovered at his imprisonment that Talamath was in the intermediate stages of becoming a lich, which most certainly means he is still �alive� inside his prison, which is quickly weakening...\n\nI envision this to be a medium-length campaign that involves a healthy mix of combat, role-play and puzzle solving, perhaps between 10 hrs of play. I also envisioned a sequence in which the player would go back in time to the height of the battlemage invasion of the island, but that might be a little too over the top for this story. Visually, the exterior of the island should be ominous, but not barren, and in general the module's mood should be serious, and somewhat gloomy. \n\nThank you for reading!","Rating":7.21,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"105":{"Name":"Persephone's Fall","Author":"Persephone","Submitted":20061112,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Amazon Princess fights to reclaim her throne and win back her people after the murder of her family and siege of her kingdom.","Description":"After the almost total destruction of the royal family of the City of Elenoa by the Dread Army of Arlancor, the princess Persephone, age 14, escapes to Themiscyra, home of the Amazons where she si trained as an amazon.

Set in any realm, the player is the bastard child of a minor king�s daughter. The kingdom is trapped between two larger warring nations, and has yet to take a side�Your mother is tight lipped about your father, and has never told anyone, her father included. You are a weird child, reclusive, and rumors spread that your father is the Prince of Darkness or an incubus� You reside in the castle with two cousins, your mother, uncle and grandfather. Your grandfather, while not particularly nice to you, does tolerate your presence. Your uncle however, seems to show you special favor. Then comes a time when he tries to poison you. You innocently catch him at it and he fumes off� from then on he treats you like dirt. You begin to visit an old hermit who lives in a cave outside the city, where he imparts upon you his knowledge of (whatever class you are�) One day; you come back to solemn faces. Your grandfather is dead through the supposed clumsiness of a servant, who just happens to be your servant. Your uncle promptly has him executed and assumes the kingship. His first act will be to take sides in this war, and you know he will side with the less ethical nation. You know you�re in trouble, your uncle hates you. Worse, you overhear him banishing your mother to a convent. Distraught, frustrated with the set up, and recalling a conversation with your servant on cremation, you lay him on his bed and light the castle on fire to cover your flight� if you had stayed your uncle surely would have killed you. As you flee the city you are captured by two scouts of the island nation your uncle will eventually fight. You convince them you are a servant that knows too much and you are taken with them for questioning. Your identity is revealed, and you are treated like their kings own son. His behavior toward you puzzles the other nobles, but they let it slide. You discover that he actually IS your father. No wonder your mother was so tight lipped about it all. Anyway, your training continues in your class, and then he sends you back to the mainland to scout around. You get some good intel, and even find your mother, and the two of you are promptly captured by your fathers enemy. You wonder why. He interrogates your mother about your father, she covers for him and says that your father is actually the prince of darkness, thinking he is suspicious of who your father really is. But the enemy seems content with this explanation. Turns out his walls won�t stand and he needs the blood of �no man� (you, who have no father, don�t count as a man) to make his walls stand tall and strong. You must use your guile to use his misconception to your advantage, learn more of his defenses and escape. From here you plant a seed of thought into his brain that will lead him into a trap. You escape to your father, who just landed on the coast, and wage an impressive campaign. You are involved in tactics, lead the battle from the front� Eventually your side wins, and your father assumes control, promptly bringing peace and prosperity.\n\nSounds relatively linear, but I�m unfamiliar with the capabilities of NWN2 and don�t know how feasible it would be to have multiple endings and such� (I thought of a story line for every class, thought that might be a little much though�)\n","Rating":7,"Awards":[]},"113":{"Name":"The Axe of Delzoun","Author":"David Uhe","Submitted":20061112,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Single Player","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Dwarven clan sends an expedition to recover an ancient artifact from a ruined dwarven city","Description":"When the Thundering Horde of orcs occupied the dwarven homeland of Delzoun, many of our clan perished in battle.

The stink of the city is hardly noticeable after the swirling aromas of food, smoke, blood and sweat. You look around to discourage the light-fingered from making your acquaintance. You are distracted by a long-gaited elf. Dressed up in Old Kingdom finery, carrying a satchel made of kid-skin, he is on a mission of such urgency that a cowled figure has taken up residence behind without garnering a notice. The stance of the figure suggests a dagger in the back is soon forth-coming. There are many reasons you can think of to stop such a happening: some good, some just as evil. You settle on a possible reward. The tavern has reduced your purse until it floats with the breeze. The elf obviously has money. You hurry to intercept the figure.\n\nArea 1: Waterdeep\n(goes to 2)\nCity, outside a tavern, night. Everyone is busy inside, either sleeping or entertaining. In this small section of the city are only you, the elf and the assassin. You can approach the assassin before she stabs the elf, or afterward. Or you can yell out a warning to the elf, and let it risk life and limb while you sneak up behind for the finishing blow. If approached, the assassin will attack you without warning, then rush towards the elf to attempt murder. Otherwise she will soon strike the elf, back-turned if possible. A back-stabbed elf will collapse on the ground, a warned elf produces a glowing dagger from out of sight, holding its own against the assassin's venom-tipped short sword. The elf carries a balm for infected wounds which will counter-act the poison to some degree. If the elf falls from a back-stab, the assassin grabs the satchel and flees into the shadows. Otherwise it flees when down to half its hit points. The elf either crawls or walks into a nearby building without speaking to you. No thank you. No reward. If you kill the assassin, or the elf does, no claim to loot either.\n\nCut-scene 1(elf was not badly wounded): The Elf and Lord Piergeiron speak, exchange a sealed letter and the elf leaves.\nCut-scene 1A(elf was badly wounded): Only show Lord Piergeiron reading the letter from up close, as the elf is too wounded.\n\nArea 1: Waterdeep\nYou can't help but wait outside to approach the elf. It is unlikely it will take up residence unless badly wounded. It is more likely to take room with its own kind. You wish to speak to it. The next figure out the door is not the elf, but Lord Piergeiron. He greats you: \"Just the I wanted to see. I have a little job for you.\"\n\nChapter One\nYou stand outside the gates of Waterdeep, your party equipped and ready to go. You must first visit Elorfindar, Lord of the free elves in the north. It is his grandson who is gone missing. It is Elorfindar who sent the message to the Lords of Waterdeep. The journey passes close to Daggerford. And an uninviting forest. You must keep your eyes open and your wits about you. And keep a dark camp.\n\nArea 2: Gates of Waterdeep\n(goes to 3)\nThere are various vendors and suspicious characters near the gates, as well as several NPCs for hire. You can buy equipment here and encourage the bored and unemployed to join your mission. You and your assembled party of PCs and NPCs head away from the gates and into the wilderness.\n\nArea 3: Zundbridge\n(gos to 4)\nYou make it through the rat hills without incident, to a wide bridge overlooked by a keep. Griffons can be seen flying away from the keep, on patrol. Traffic is slow but steady across the wide river. Here and there a person stops to look at the river or the stones of the bridge. The guards hurry them along. It is well known the bridge was constructed by a golem under a wizard's command. There are many who wish to find this golem for their own ends. You cross the bridge to the keep to speak with someone about any activity near the road. The sergeant won't allow you inside, says it upsets the griffons. But she tells you it has been unseasonably quiet. Watch yourself.\n\nArea 4: A Farm Without Hay\n(goes to 5 and 6)\nYou stop by a farm for some water and conversation about activity in the nearby wood. Though a farmer stands by a broken fence, willing to converse on all matter of subjects, his farm looks untended, and his counter-questions make you uneasy. He offers to let you sleep the night in his barn. If you choose to sleep outside instead, the party will be attacked at night. Your options are to put fake sleepers in your bedding while waiting in ambush, to post guards throughout the night, or to let everyone sleep soundly. The later option will result in a free backstab for three random characters unless they make a listen check versus move silently, before their screams of pain wake up the others. The guarding option results in each guard having three arrows shot at them as sneak attacks, unless they make a listen check first. The other characters then make a listen check +6 to wake up. If no one does and the guards were killed, and the sleep soundly results go into effect. In the ambush option six black-garbed individuals sneak into camp. If they fail a listen and search check they attack the stuffed sheets, losing initiative and becoming surprised. Otherwise they recognize a try and try to flee. If 3 assassins fall at any time, the others break off and flee, using dust of disappearance. When it is all over the farmer runs out of the house, claiming shock and fear. Dead assassins each have twenty gold coins minted with a serpent on both sides. \n\nArea 5: Inside The Barn\n(inside 4)\nAmazingly, the doors make no sound when opened. If you examine them you will find them freshly oiled. Strange for a decrepit homestead infrequently managed. There are no animals inside, but there is old tied-together hay. A ranger won't be able to find any sign of recent use. Your options for sleeping are to make hay effigies to fill your bedding while waiting in ambush, to post guards throughout the night, or to let everyone sleep soundly. You can also wipe the oil off the hinges to make them squeek. An attack will come in the night, much like that outside. If the doors are oiled the check are -2, if they are wiped clean the checks are +2. There is, however, a chance of fighting causing a fire in the barn.\n\nArea 4: A Farm Without Hay\nAfter the fight the farmer is apologetic for his cowardice and explains that he lost all his livestock to bandits, and his wife and children moved to Waterdeep. After this he's going to join them, and will inform the Griffon Watch on the way. He is not a very believable sort, but won't crumble under threats or persuasion. Physical abuse will get him to eventually admit he works with the bandits and was informed a rich party of adventurers were coming through and would have some good loot. This could actually be the truth.\n\nArea 6: Outside Elorfindar's Estate\n(goes to 7, 8 and 9)\nThere are no more problems from the farm to Elorfindar's Estate north of Daggerford. It is not what you expected. You didn't know what kind of structures elves would make out in the open, but you did expect it to look elven. From a distance it appeared to be your average baronial estate. As you got closer, you could make out the elven influences in the edges, the texture, the windows. An elf comes out to ask your business. When you show the missive from Elorfindar you are ushered inside.\n\nChapter Two\nYou have reached the great hall of the person who has asked for your help. It seems clean and cheerful for inside. Here you will find clues to continue your journey. Elorfindar Floshin is dignified in a way you envy. He greets you and begins to speak:\n\nCut-scene 2: Elorfindar greets you and tells you how his grandson went to search the High Moor for any signs of his father, but has not returned or contacted anyone for too long a time not to have gotten into trouble. Kelson left a message to be opened three months to the day after he was gone, and that day came and went. It said he had found a secret compartment of his father's papers suggesting where he might be, so he decided to follow the trail. Kelson's father, Filvendor, left 20 years ago to the east and was never seen again. After reading the message, Elorfindar asked the Paladinson for help. And here you are.\n\nArea 7: Elorfindar's Hall\n(inside 6)\nElorfindar's hall is grand, with some delightful Elven trappings. Elorfindar brings his son's items for examination, including his journal. You may ask him anything you want, but only this one time will you be allowed in his presence without his grandson. The items include a rock, scales, specifically marked arrows, and coins with a serpent on both sides. He left them behind in case robbed or captured, so his intentions would not be known. After a time Elorfindar will leave, and you will be escorted out. Your mission has been clarified. Find Kelson Darktreader or his body. He is searching for his father Filvendor Floshin, who went into the east and was lost with no sign.\n\nArea 6: Outside Elorfindar's Estate\nThe elf that greeted you has brought out food and refreshment for the party and their animals. Apparently you will not eat inside with the older folks. Elves will be allowed to eat with their counterparts in another hall, but not half-elves, despite how many of Elorfindar's children are such. Once you have supped you will be asked to leave the premises by politely being told of a nice encampment by a stream which has been set up for you.\n\nArea 8: Sleeping Arrangements\n(attached to 6)\nAn encampment for rest and resupply. It will always be restocked with items you need should you ever come back. Elven jerkins, elven arrows, elven longbows, elven daggers, elven spell books, but no elven company. The elves always know when you are coming. You can rest here without interruption.\n\nArea 9: Laughing Hollow\n(goes to 7, 8, 10 and 12)\nThis wild and dangerous area will usually have an encounter when entered. It may be orcs, wild animals, an elf patrol, even some wandering undead from a recent necromancer problem. If it is an elf patrol, they will lead you to the Elf King's encampment. It is magically hidden among the brush. If asked about the Wild Elves, Elorfindar will have given the players a gem of true seeing to find the entrance to the encampment. Otherwise they may not find it. Resting here will always result in an encounter.\n\nCut-scene 3: The Elf King greets the party and sets down the house rules. Everybody has to enjoy themselves, even dwarves. Half-Orcs might find a nearby cave much more palatable.\n\nArea 10: Wild Elf Camp\n(attached to 9)\nThe Elf king will answer questions until they become boring, but his second answers all half-orc questions, and then only curtly. Orcs are a constant menace here, and it takes restraint on their part not to kill mixed ones. Kelson Darktreader was here on his way to the Misty Forest. He left nothing behind. Food and drink and merriment are in abundance. But the elves have no time for conversation. They are too busy dancing, drinking and singing. It is too noisy to rest here at any time. Other than a token of friendship given to each (even half-orcs), nothing else is to be gained here.\n\nArea 11: Cave Killer\n(attached to 10)\nAll half-orcs are directed towards this cave. It is a beautiful cave if you don't mind the bones of those killed by piercers. Or the piercers dropping down from above. The elves would never try to kill a guest, but if a natural event were to do so; they did inform you the hollow was dangerous. It is in their nature to be chaotic. A crystal formation is truly worth seeing, despite death from above. There is some random treasure on a half-orc's body for whatever class (original 1st level class) the searcher has. The elves didn't touch the body, even leaving the badge of friendship.\n\nArea 9: Laughing Hollow\nIf you have met the Elf King there will be no encounters in the Hollow except for an elven patrol. They were informed you were coming and cleared the area for you. But they will remain hidden and silent unless called for. You will also be allowed to rest here in relative quiet, except the occasional death call of something that got too close to your camp. Otherwise, same as earlier description.\n\nCut-scene 4: More Wild Elves stop you at the edge of the Misty Forest, appearing from the mist as if they had been invisible. If you have badges from the Elf King they tell you the news they are aware of and confirm Kelson came this way and into the Forest.\nCut-scene 4A: More Wild Elves stop you at the edge of the Misty Forest, appearing from the mist as if they had been invisible. If you have no badges from the Elf King they ask you to leave. You get the feeling there are more of them watching you from the shadows. It would not be good to test their bowmanship.\n\nArea 12: Forest Guardians\n(goes to 9 and 13)\nWild Elves stop anyone from entering without a pass. The party can camp out just outside the forest with relative peace. They might wake up to see an elf sitting by the fire to warm his or her bones, but no hostile encounters. Getting into the forest without a badge requires combat with the elves. They will fight from the woods, but not to the death. Attacking them makes you enemies in Laughing Hollow and with Elorfindar's people, though those will refrain from attacking you while Kelson is missing. You will no longer be able to camp outside Elorfindar's estate without rest being interrupted, and goodies will no longer be supplied, though rancid meat will be left for you.\n\nArea 13: Misty Forest\n(goes to 12, 14 and 15)\nThe forest is lonely, dark and damp. Even the animals don't like coming here. The silence is deafening. A white hart jumps out into a clearing, stops to drink, then flees across the stream before you can react. A barbarian runs out of the brush in chase. He sees your party and whistles for his own. There is a chance to fight, talk or be ignored. The barbarians are here to hunt for their families. If you offer no threat they will continue. If you wish to parley they will be in a less than happy mood due to loosing their kill. If you offer to help them hunt, they will continue on to kill the hart and offer you some meat, being more amenable to conversation. If you so much as place a hand on your weapon, a fight will ensue. The barbarians will not fight to the death as a rule, neither will they surrender. They can't give much information. The humanoid power struggles on the moors change by the season. No new power has arisen. None have seen Kelson Darktreader. But if the party helped the barbarians hunt, one will mention his father letting Filvendor eat in his hut 20 years ago. Something was left behind if you wish to see it. This barbarian will leave the hunting party and lead you to his home in the next area.\n\nFuture visits to the forest may meet orcs up to mischief, another barbarian hunting party, a wandering druid maintaining the forest, or an elf patrol. Whether this patrol will ambush you or not depends on what you have done previously. As normal, elves always hide on contact, with only one coming out to converse if he or she sees a reason. If you met an elven patrol they can sow you where Kelson last slept here. A ranger or druid might find it on their own, perhaps even a barbarian.\n\nArea 14: An Abandoned Camp\n(attached to 13)\nKelson camped here from the look of things. A rock overhang to keep out the rain and hide smoke. Footprints are everywhere, with signs of a struggle and dried blood. A rumpled piece of paper has been thrown into the fire. It is blackened but unharmed. The paper must be magical. It tells of a complex in the Moors possessing great magical power.\n\nChapter Three\nMist envelops the party, making each person appear and disappear like ghosts. The landscape ahead looks like the world fell on it. Nothing appears to be growing anywhere. You will be hard put to feed your pack animals or yourselves. No wonder the barbarians use the forest to feed their families.\n\nArea 15: The Edge of Desolation\n(goes to 14 and 16)\nYou come to the edge of the Misty Forest, overlooking the High Moor. It is covered with sparse vegetation and clumps of rock. It is hard to tell the natural formations from the ruins. Javelins fly from the rocks in ambush. Searching for the ambushers finds nothing. Not even tracks. If the barbarian is with you he says they are serpents. They sometimes come here from the Serpent Hills, but usually don't go near the Misty Forest.\n\nArea 16: What A Barbarian Wants\n(goes to 15, 17 and 18)\nThere is a small barbarian community here, keeping goats and sheep in a walled encampment. If you are alone the barbarians go inside and close their doors. They have no locks. If you wait for them to come out again they will get angry and ask you to leave at sword- and spear-point. If you are with the barbarian from the forest they wave to him and ask him how the hunt was, but ignore your party entirely. Only one of you may enter the encampment or the hut. They will not speak to you.\n\nArea 17: A Sod Hut\n(inside 16)\nIf you befriended a barbarian in the Misty Forest and learned Filvendor came to this camp, you will be entertained inside this tent, as any guest would be, with food and drink, simple but good. After the meal the barbarian hands you a cloth-wrapped package. It is heavy. When you unwrap it you see a rock engraved with one rune. At your consternation the barbarian laughs. It is the wrapping paper that is important. It is a map showing a location close to the Hark.\n\nArea 16: What A Barbarian Wants\nOnce the enclosure is left, the barbarians do not welcome the player back. They also discourage camping by moving their animals through your campsite, as well as the fertilizing presents they leave behind ending up on your pillow.\n\nArea 18: Any Ruins Will Do\n(goes to 16, 19 and 20)\nHalf-way across the Moor you need a place to rest for the night. A clump of ruins look dangerous and unoccupied. You find a tower with most of its lower wall intact and start a fire. Same sleeping rules as before. Trolls come out of the ground to attack in the night, throwing water onto your fire immediately, putting it out and raising a cloud of smoke that obscures vision and makes you cough. Survivors will flee into tunnels under the ruins. The dead will likely regenerate as your fire-source is wet. There is almost no wood in the vicinity, only enough to make a campfire. That was left by the trolls as a trap. They picked up everything flammable within a league and store it underground for their own use.\n\nArea 19: The Bloody Cloth\n(under 18)\nThe nearby ruins are connected underground by tunnels, but no basements. All the holes are behind the largest remaining walls. The tunnels are large enough for a troll to crawl through, but not tall enough for a human to stand upright. Alcoves have nests of bedding, and on alcove is full of brush and other flammable materials. Igniting it will fill the tunnels with smoke which chases the trolls outside. There is also a cell of sorts here, a hole dug into the ground with a rock covering it with a pile of bloody clothes nearby. Though the clothing looks elven, that is hardly conclusive. Inside the cramped hole is a cot with blood on it. Crawling into the hole requires someone slim or small. If the walls are searched a piece crumbles off, exposing a thin missive from Kelson explaining his capture and where he thinks he will be taken. The trolls will work in tandem. One will stand its ground while another drops down from a hole behind you. The holes are easy fro a troll to climb out, but not for a demi-human. Trolls will flee temporarily, then come back to fight again from another direction. They never forget they can regenerate. It will be hard to kill even a single one.\n\nArea 18: Any Ruins Will Do\nShould half the trolls fall, permanently or semi-permanently, a group of bugbears with torches approaches to retake their home. If not attacked, they will gather around the holes, waiting for a troll to pop up, so they can jab them with burning brands and pour hot pitch on them. They won't go into the holes to finish them off, but any troll caught on the surface won't survive for long. The bugbears will let you stay the night if you kill off the rest of the trolls for good and the chief will tell you how to find the place on your map (if you have it). They know the Hark is occupied and too deadly to come near, and that the trolls cleared out the area of all types of food sources. The bugbears saw the party and followed in the hope it would take care of the troll problem. If attacked, they will throw their torches into the holes and flee into the dark. They know how to hide, this used to be their home. You will not be welcome back here.\n\nArea 20: More Welcome Desolation\n(goes to 18, 21 and 25)\nThis is the place shown on Filvendor's map. If you don't have the map you won't come here. There are ruins above ground, many of them repaired. And amazingly enough, gnolls walk freely among the buildings. It is rare to see them out of Anauroch, due to their dislike of cold. It may be possible to sneak by the gnolls into a building with a cellar, but if found out a great battle will ensue. If the gnolls get the worst of it they will retreat underground.\n\nAreas 21-22: A Rat's Den\n(under 20)\nThere are two levels of this underground complex made of stone. Several pools of blood denote traps that have gone off. Many areas have not seen a footprint in decades. The gnolls have taken up residence, obviously searching for something. Some of them can actually read. Loot here will include scrolls and a wand, and defenders will have magic to cast from memory. It is a large complex with many defenders.\n\nArea 23: More Than Meets The Eye\n(under 23)\nThe lower level is a group of storage rooms converted into a dungeon, though not done so by the gnolls. These chambers have changed ownership many times. The gnolls avoid it because of the spectre, but there are also rats and a few slithering insects here. It is dusty except for a single pair of footprints. In the center is a magically sealed room. It does not have what the gnolls want. They have been told this by their masters. The spectre is not the one who was held in the room. It is unlikely anyone will ever know what it was before.\n\nArea 24: The Empty Cell\n(attached to 23)\nBehind a solidly locked door, with magical protection is a rather austere cell. Chains kept the victim outstretched. Bloodtstains on the floor partially cover the word Filvend. It was apparently scratched out with a toe nail. This is a magician's prison, to prevent non-vocal, non-gesturing magic. It is unlikely it can be entered, but the magic isn't being maintained and has weakened from several incursions.\n\nArea 20: More Welcome Desolation\nOutside, more gnolls returning from a raid fight with you, though they retreat if their barks illicit no response from within. They will trap the place after you leave if any survive. More gnolls will be here if you return, this time with ogre and bugbear reinforcements. And spellcasters.\n\nChapter Four\nArea 25: Hills of the Serpent\n(gos to 20 and 26)\nYou leave the High Moors and enter the Serpent Hills. This in and of itself is an invitation to be attacked. There will be a random encounter every time this area is entered. This attack will come from the air, the ground or from the serpents. It is otherwise bare of anything.\n\nArea 26: Slow in the Shade\n(goes to 25 and 27)\nThis hill has a fortress on top with no easy access. There are no caves or tunnels in the earth. No door, visible or hidden. It appears it may only be entered from above. There is an ambush you must fight your way through. Getting in will require magic or a rope with a grappling hook. There will always be an encounter outside\n\nArea 27: What A Snake Wants\n(inside 26)\nThe roof entrance drops down into the aerie for winged serpents. These are not dragons, they spit poison and slash with their tail. They have Ophidia handlers. Ophidia are all over the keep. As are several snake-worshiping magic-users from several races. And a few snake-riders. An entrance leads to caverns below. If any Ophidia escape below they will warn the whole community of your presence.\n\nAreas 28-29: A Slippery Bolt-hole\n(under 27)\nTwo levels of caverns house more Ophidia and Yuan-ti, as well as booby-traps. The snakes live here and have a religious community. They also have serpent pets with poisonous bites. The lower level has a pool of constricting snakes as well. A ramp leads down to the temple. You will be attacked here always. But there is some good treasure from the Yuan-ti. There are food cells here, but they are mostly empty. Kelson is not here.\n\nArea 30: Return of the Grandson\n(under 29)\nA nagara holds temple here, controlling this section of the serpent hills. It is both temple and government facility. The nagara will have brought Kelson Darktreader from his cell to use as a bargaining chip. It will talk to the party, and hold back its guardians. If the party only wants the Elf, they can have him and leave. But never enter the Serpent Hills again. There are levels of deceit and truth here dependent on skills and rolls. By nature a nagara will deceive, but it also wishes to live. Refuse the bargain and she slashes Kelson's throat with her fangs. The fight here will be vicious. Many guardians were out of sight waiting for a signal. The party can get out of here without a fight. Winning here gives a lot of treasure. The nagara kept it in a chamber behind the serpent altar.\n\nArea 26: Slow in the Shade\nIf Kelson is alive, he thanks you and offers to return to his grandfather for a rest, before heading out again. If he is informed of anything that may have been found out about his father, he gets excited and would head out without supplies or weapons. You can get him to go as far as the Misty Forest, where he expects to be supplied by elves. But he will not return with you. However, he will write a note for his grandfather. If he is dead, you can decide to go back with his remains (if you have them), or continue to find out what happened to his father. That is another story in another forest. Fade out here.\n\nEpilogue\nArea 7: Elorfindar's Hall\nIf Kelson survives and returns home, or he dies and his remains are brought home, one of two ending movies will happen. In both Elorfindar thanks them. They are rewarded with elven equipment and Old Kingdom coins. Should Elorfindar be informed of any news of his son, he asks the party if they will search for more clues, and offers to let them rest inside his manor until they are ready. The players answer, and the story ends. Fade out.","Rating":8.87,"Votes":51,"Awards":["ModuleIdeaTopWinner.jpg"]},"116":{"Name":"Stalked","Author":"Alex \"Hugie\" Hugon","Submitted":20061112,"Updated":20061203,"Category":"Single Player","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Surreal Horror adventure; you are stalked by a hooded creature that only you can see.","Description":"2nd Overall in the NWN2 Module Idea ContestFinal Score: 8.66At first, you had thought It was just a figment of your imagination.

You are part of an expedition into the depths of Mt. Seri in the Seri Desert, to uncover artifacts at an old dig site.  The remains of a crescent gem begin your adventure of danger,","Description":"8th Place NWN 2 Module Idea Contest Winner:\n\n\nChandelier Lights takes place in a world known as Raion. The year is 344 TE (Third Era). The world seems that it has reached a peak: nations of civilized races, large technological advancements such as flying ships (cheesy, yet effective), and a surprisingly large thirst for knowledge. Raion is, for one reason or another, largely rooted in mystery. There are numerous theories as to why, with the most popular being that the leaders of the First Era sought to destroy all knowledge of the downfall of the time before the Eras began. The Second Era occurred with the overthrow of the oppression of knowledge, and the Third Era after the Battle of that Erias Key, an artifact rumored to have powers beyond that of all the spells in the world combined.\n\nStill, the search for knowledge goes on, and the adventure of Chandelier Lights begins with such a search. You arrive in the Seri Desert, as a member of an expedition. Whether you are hired protection, a researcher, or of a different position shall be decided by one of the first conversations taking place. The traveling party finally reaches its destination: Mount Seri. Remains of a dig site of the Second Era have recently been discovered, and the Institute of Second Era Enigmas has funded the expedition. Apparently the Second Era researchers got as far as finding a door into a dungeon, but not much farther inside. The team goes inside, with you leading, either due to drawing straws or you�re the muscle of the group.\n\nAfter being attacked by a small group of zombies, you meet a floating light that advises you turn back. Classic. Nevertheless, you proceed onward, since you�ll likely serve a prison sentence if you come back empty handed (due to your breach of contract with the Institution). You continue to proceed through the dungeon, coming across a room filled with treasure. In the corner room, next to all the stacks of gold, books, and treasures, lays a crescent-shaped gem. It�s translucent, yet still has substance to it. Whether you show it to the rest of the group or not, the rest of the group packs up a variety of items: weapons, books, spell scrolls, and a large variety of shiny objects. You all load up and exit the dungeon. After you wade the rest of the day out, you begin traveling at night, until you come across Gahlil, a small town on the outskirts of the desert.\n\nThe expedition spends the night at the local inn, and during that night, someone comes breaking into your window. The figure is covered in dark clothing, and their face masked and cloaked. They�re definitely male; he covers your mouth (text says it, doesn�t actually appear on screen), and then says to you, �Leave the vescaras (an elven word meaning, roughly, �sacred artifact�) here, lest the consequences be dire.� And with that, he exits the same way he came in. After explaining last night to your fellow party members, you take an airship across oceans and lands back to Borlandi, capital of the country of Noralis. After numerous dull meetings and presentations, you and the rest of the party are first on the tour of the museum that houses most of your findings (minus whatever you decided to keep for yourself *wink wink nudge nudge*). This doesn�t include the crescent gem, as for some reason, the institution decided not to keep it, saying it had no value.\n\nAnd therein lies their error. And therein begins your adventure.\n\n-Projected to have multiple romance plotlines\n-Play any type of character you wish\n-Various endings, with both positive and negative effects on the world\n-Anywhere from 5 to 12 hours of gameplay\n-Plenty pop culture references that hopefully most people will get a laugh out of\n\n\n\n\nPLOTLINE SPOILERS AHEAD\n�Fairly warned be ye, fan boys.� ~ Leo, VG Cats\n\n\n\n\n\n- The Chandelier will, essentially, be a very important piece of the module. It holds significant value to the plot. I envision the Chandelier to be a magical device, made in the shape of a chandelier. Crystals are what power it, like the one found in the Mt. Seri dig. In fact, the one in this module is the last one needed. With it, the ability to distort the fabric of time can be changed. The Chandelier can also be used as a portal to allow one to venture through the past and, supposedly, the future of Raion.\n\n\n\n- Lights are, as you may have guessed from reading the above idea, the crystals. They allow certain powers to be added to the Chandelier. For example, the Light of Present Observation allows one to look at any moment within 5 years backwards. The Light of Past Observation allows sight to go back even farther. There are assumedly 19 crystals on the Chandelier. The player character�s shall be the 19th. That crystal is the Light of Travel, the Light that supposedly allows users to travel through time.\n\n\n\n- Although a minor idea, there should be plenty implication of space/universe concepts. Granted, space travel is not yet possible in the world of Raion, but perhaps the atmosphere of space would bring a new light to it� Or perhaps something that just adds a supernatural feel to the module concept. Most of it will be in a normal-type fantasy setting, but a strange atmosphere would help the stranger parts, such as the room where the Chandelier is.

I say perfect time for a beat down on those neighbors that complained about you having pink flamingos on your lawn. Hopefully your friends (Players) haven�t been bitten or killed, if they have been, you know what you have to do. You hopefully meet up with the friends that have survived, but the problem is are you sure everyone is zombie virus clean? Because of the adventures you and your friends have gone on, you and your friends have somewhat of a resistance to the zombie virus. Instead of transforming you instantly, it takes 5 or more minutes, but some have more resistance than others so you never know if that friend you have been partied with for 15 minutes is not going to turn any second. The only sure way is the dead way, so your choice whether you trust them or rather be safe than sorry. If you do kill them and they weren�t a zombie hopefully they don�t become a Sims ghost and bug the crap out of you for the rest of the adventure.\n\nNow with your party assembled its your choice to what you want to do, you can either stay in town and just lay a beat down on these flesh eating zombies, or you can be the good Sims City citizen and find out the root of this infection.

It is a who-dun-it with a twist. It has multiple endings and multiple suspects each with their own motives. This is perfect for a DM who constantly is starting campaigns but wants a different adventure each time. This module plays differently each time it's run so the DM gets a fresh story, yet remains familiar with the NPCs and setting. The antagonist changes as do the dialogues, based on either the DM's choice, or random player input's in some early encounters in the module. \n\nThis is more story driven than combat. The Town of Wolfsgate is a frontier town on the outskirts of civilization. The neighboring forest is known for the wolf-riding elves who are very xenophobic and hostile. Their druids and rangers launch raids on any farmer or lumberjacks that encroach too far into the forest. The town was is in turmoil for the mayor's daughter has been gone missing. The players are presented a full on mystery they have to solve to save the day. There will be side quests that open up as the players get further into their investigation. \n\nWho is behind the nefarious plot? \n\nInara Levolan - The elf-wolfrider high priestess who is making a statement the community cannot ignore? \n\nCaptain Hiloran Graymare - Captain of the Guard who is besotted with the mayor's daughter and is convinced he and only he is the right man for her?\n\nCardinal Jesup - The only cleric in town, who has lusted after the Mayor's daughter? \n\nMr. Agnar Kenthwick - the Mayor's Registrar, who had to do something when the Mayor's daughter discovered his plot to take over the town. \n\nRed Blackwood - the thief lord who is holding her ransom, he wants to come to an understanding with the local watch on certain matters. \n\nThe Mayor - he's gone insane, and is determined that his daughter is his long dead wife, and that nothing can harm her, so he's locked her up in the dungeons underneath the town\n\nSarabeth - The Mayor's daughter is behind it all, she's holding herself for ransom so that she and her flakey boyfriend Johan can have enough money to leave this little hick-town and live in the good life in the big city.\n\n-----------------\n\nSo we're building about 7 or more (we can add more over time) plots but only one will be used at any time. \n\nNote: The concept of multiple paths was first introduced to me in a early GURPS module called 'Tourney at Harkwood', which was one of the most clever modules I've ever read. The only similarities between what I've written and the module is the idea of multiple paths, and that there is a Mayor and a Daughter.

He must relive the events of his life to unlock a secret that would allow him to escape the Nexus and find his way to the afterlife.","Description":"The story begins with our hero in a strange area. This area is known as the Nexus of time. Within this nexus, there is no past or future. There is only our hero. Our hero wakes up from a deep sleep and has no memory of what has happened in the past. He has no memory of who he is, where he came from, what happened in his life, or how he came to be in this Nexus. A strange, celestrial being appears and explains what the Nexus is. He also explains that he is the keeper of the Nexus and his name is Orion. Orion tells our hero that the hero was in a great battle that would shape the future of the world. However, Orion only knows vague information and tells our hero he must relive events in his life to remember what the purpose of his existence is. Only then, will our hero be able to leave the Nexus and move on with his life or afterlife. The module will switch to our hero in a tavern. Orion's voice tells our hero that he must take an account of all that happens. Questions will be asked later which will result in passing to the next stage or having to relive the same part of life until the answers are revealed. \nThe first stage would be about our hero finishing small quests and monster bashing. Towards the end, a strange wizard appears and explains that a dragon named Grimdol was sealed with magic in the Mountains of Turlok. But a dark group of beings who are part of an order created the disciples of Grimdol have been looking for ways to break the seal. Our wizard warns our hero that they are very close to unlocking Grimdol and asks our hero to stop the wizards. Our hero then returns to the Nexus and is asked questions about the encounter with the wizard and why the wizard appeared. Stage 2 and 3 will each be about our hero searching for the Dark Five, the order of disciples of Grimdol. The first is a necromancer who surrounds himself with undead minions and his lair is in a crypt. He was part of a rich, noble family. However, since birth, he was sickly looking and his parents favored his younger brother, who was said to inherit his father's estate and fortune rather than the older brother. Also, our necromancer was picked on by other children and looked down upon. Then came along a discple of Grimdol who taught our necromancer the dark arts. Eventually he took revenge on his family and those who looked down on him. The second is a mighty orc warrior. His orc village were notorious for attacking small towns, pillaging them, and killing humans indiscriminately. Those who survived banded together and destroyed the orc village, taking revenge on those who murdered their loved ones. Our orc warrior was hiding in a bush when this happened and watched in horror. He vowed to avenge his people. He was approached by warrior of the order of Grimdol followers and they taught him how to fight. Both these are meant to show two who have a deep hatred for human beings. This is a part of what fuels the power of Grimdol and his followers. After the defeat of each, both give clues to the whereabouts of the other members of the Dark Five. The third stage starts in a town where people discuss about missing people. Many people have gone missing. One man suspects it is the work of the scientist who lived in the town. He lived there for years, but nothing bad happened until now. Our hero approaches the estate of the scientist. Once inside, each room contains different kinds of monsters such as orcs, trolls, etc. Also, each room has lab notes talking about experiments on subjects, turning them into \"strong beasts,\" \"sickly creatures,\" or talking about subjects not surviving transformations. When our hero reaches the scientist, everything comes together. He has been experimenting on the citizens of the town to see if transformation into monsters is possible. He hasn't started until recently because he hasn't collected enough creatures yet. He finally was successful in creating creatures that could transform from human to beasts and vice versa, and he has done it to himself. He transforms into a wyvern and explains that the wyvern was a part of the Dark Five as well. They decided to fuse to make themselves even more powerful. They attack our hero. After our hero defeats them, he is transported to the Nexus. From there, we go to stage 4, where we find our wizard friend from the beginning standing on top of a large, stone pentegram. He then explains that he is the fifth of the Dark Five. He is also an original disciple of Grimdol and was taught by Grimdol himself. Our hero says that he will not let Grimdol rise, but the wizard says it is inevitable. Even if the wizard dies, Grimdol will rise. The wizard turns into a dragon and attacks our hero. When our hero defeats the wizard/dragon, his dying words are \"You haven't won yet. This is only the beginning of the reign of terror. You will die just like all who oppose Grimdol.\" When he dies, the pentegram glows and our hero cries out in pain. The pentegram breaks and there is a huge red dragon in place of it. Grimdol has risen and explains how everything occurred and it was our hero's fault. Each member of the Dark Five had dark powers searing through their veins that was passed down from the original disciples of Grimdol. They're spirits and the dark powers were fused. However, only our wizard friend, the original disciple knew that if each member was killed, the dark powers and his spirit would be stored into the pentegram and would allow Grimdol to rise again. The original disciple asked our hero to kill the others because he knew there would be trouble if he turned on his fellow members. Therefore, what better way than to ask a hero to kill them. Also, our hero was needed for the final stage of the unsealment. Our hero was the final key to breaking the seal or pentegram, for our hero has the essence of Grimdol. It was said that a portion of Grimdol's power would enter an infant and this child's future would be intertwined with Grimdol's fate. This was why the wizard was at the stone pentegram. Only through the presence of the final piece of Grimdol's power would the seal open. Our hero is taken to the Nexus and must answer questions and show his resolve. Our hero has a choice, whether to join Grimdol and devote himself to him or to slay him.","Rating":6.46,"Votes":16,"Awards":[]},"143":{"Name":"The Supernal Prostitution of Myrrhal Draewyn","Author":"David Hummer","Submitted":20061113,"Updated":20061202,"Category":"Single Player","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"A small task of finding your cousin turns out to be much more than anyone would have imagined, and you find yourself catapulted into a chain of events that may spell doom for the home and family you love.

With love, and hope, Danielle.\"]\n\nUpon reaching your hometown, you seek out your family manor. Here you meet your relatives, those that you have not seen for a year-and-a-half. They tell you a little about the attack, and implore you to seek out the mayor.\n\n-NOTE: The mayor is a pompous idiot, and he will attempt to waste your time.\n\nHe does know where the bandits went, but he does not care. You must persuade him to tell you, if you are a rogue, and an option will be made available for you. This might bring together scores from both persuasion AND bluffing. Intimidation can be used, but he will not cooperate further, and he will only tell you half of the truth. If you do it this way, you begin your journey (\"on foot\") with a caravan acting as a guard half the way to your destination. The connections of the mayor in the high court buys you passage, but you suspect he could have done better. The stable master Belroy knows too, however. Speak to him and ask him for information on the bandits whereabouts, and he will tell you. They are already 3 months ahead of you, but since they were on foot for the majority of the journey, he offers you a horse to ride. When you find the information and get a horse, you will ride after the bandits. This will warp you to a desert camp, which is technically very far away (a month-and-a-half worth of riding). Supposedly, you were ambushed by someone, and so you must flee to the nearest town.\n\n-NOTE: keep in mind that this ambush needs to be difficult, as a well-planned ambush is meant to kill with the element of surprise. Therefore, the player has to use strategy and a lot of running to survive, let alone kill all the bandits.\n\n->here's a hint: fighting will not always guarantee success. Sometimes it's better to run, and still be able to progress, than to die again, and again, and again. As long as you keep to your objectives (which may mean survive, and not kill!), you�ll be just fine. Sometimes, killing enemies without orders to (meaning you are allowed to run) may keep them from harassing you in the future, but maybe it might be better to wait until you're more powerful before squashing them all later when they reappear.\n\nAt this town, you continue to track the bandits as they travel deeper and deeper into the great Bleached Plains. Following them, you hit a series of encounters until you come upon their wagon camp next to a canyon and some ruins. You have reached the heart of the desert, where the slavers took your cousin. After wiping out all of the slavers, you find out that they have no knowledge of this tower, but are told to enter the ruined doorway with a rune stone you acquire. The leader also mentions that screams are known to issue from the tower, screams of women and children sold to the proprietor, and he dies with a cruel smile. With the rune stone, you make your way into the tower, to find it a simple ruined tower without anything special. Your plan to rescue is halted, but you, upon returning to town, find out that you must draw the attention of the resident with bait. \n\n+ (deviation) - if you are playing as a female character, then you do not need bait. You ARE the bait, and what follows differs vastly from the male deviation.\n\nYou enter the tower this time, and you wait a little while. Before long, a hooded figure appears that carries a single candle and greets you in a surprisingly friendly tone. However, you feel your consciousness fade for a moment, and when you come back to your senses, everything you had on you is gone. The figure then compels you to follow it, and it will (warp) take you into the subterranean tomb complex. Inside the complex, you are started inside of a room with a single warded doorway. The figure implores you to be patient, and then disappears to converse with his master. The next parts follow as a puzzle, and you must find your way out of the room. When you leave your room, you are still unarmed and pretty much naked, so you must look for something. When you leave this second room (the next door is unlocked, but bashable), you'll encounter the snaky man again. He will attack you after a \"You musts not leave your roomssss.\" When you kill him, you will acquire a ring that can be used to open the locked door later on in the complex. Upon doing this, you begin to explore your surroundings and find another room, except this one is home to a beautiful young woman.\n+ Deviation ends\n\n+ (deviation) - if you are playing as a male character, then you need this next part.\n\nThis bait must be a slave, but if what you hear is right, you need to find a woman willing to accompany you. You find someone and the plan is set, but you must make it back. Upon reaching the tower once again, you make your way inside, and you wait a little while. Then, a figure (The Guide) appears before you, a hooded figure that carries a single candle. It sees the woman, but then catches a scent on the air, and sees you. It hisses out a, \"You musts not be heressss!\" and then abruptly attacks. You fight it, finding it semi-hard and then witness it disappear hissing, \"The master will not be pleased-.\" Upon its belongings left over, you find the candle and a ring. The woman follows you, and you tell her to stay here, but she disagrees at first. If you give in, she will follow you as a henchmen. If you don�t give in, then the woman stays behind, but she will come back to haunt you, since she will not survive alone. You follow the candle to where it leads you to a subterranean door in the bottomless canyon next to the ruin. You use the ring to enter and walk into a tomb complex of sorts. Inside, you are not approached by anything, except one new door and a riddle. Upon breaking this riddle, you make your way in to explore your surroundings. In one room, you find it to be empty except for a single young woman, beautiful and yet awkward, as if there was some strange deformity about her, though it is not physically noticeable.\n+ Deviation ends\n\nShe sees you and dashes to your side, begging you to help her.You don't know who she is, and so you ask her name. She says that she really doesn't know what her name is, but she gets a feeling that it was at one point, Amryaa. She says she is bound in chains, though you cannot see them or fathom them.\n\n-NOTE: this geas is not one that was intentionally placed; it is one that occurred because of Amryaa's creation.\n\nThis is because she is still tied to Baahalman. Upon destroying him, she will be free. You believe it to be a geas of sorts, and so you seek out the owner of this tower. You come to a heavy metal door at the one end of the tower/subterranean hideout and use the key to unlock it in a burst of power that destroys the ring. He is Baahalman, and he is not happy to see you. Upon entering, you are addressed by this corrupted being.\n\n[\"Behold, fool, the dread empress ja'Koreliin. You have erred greatly in coming here, for no mortal man may gaze upon the divine without consequence!\"]\n\n[\"Peace, Draewyn! I would speak to this individual without your clumsy interference!\"]\n\n[\"I will not, and cannot! There are older laws that must be obeyed without question. Older laws that may not be counteracted even by your command. I apologize, but my duty remains clear.\"]\n\nYou notice the young empress and realize that she is the cousin you have been looking for. However, you did not recognize her earlier because of the jewels and exotic dress. She also seems to have the same awkward characteristic as Amryaa. Baahalman attacks you and you retaliate.\n\n+ (deviation) - here's a deviation for you! if you are playing as a character with a high charisma, you stand the chance of bringing the empress' wrath upon Baahalman! But to do this requires unnaturally high charisma, a spec that will be hard to reach, let alone top.\n\n-> here�s a hint: He is very powerful in melee, but he's slow. Since you are still relatively low in level, it is recommended that you try to use ranged spells and attacks to take him out. Keep in mind, his fortitude and will saving throws are disgustingly high -> hence, try to use damaging spells because dominating and disabling spells won't work.\n \nUpon his reduction to 50% hit points, he turns to Alies and motions for her to take action.\n\n[\"Empress, smite this fool, so that he may know truly what he trifles with!\"]\n\n[\"I will not fight for you, Draewyn! You brought this upon yourself! Defeat your opponent, your master commands you!\"]\n\n[\"Then I have no choice but to succeed, or perish. I salute you, mine enemy, but the end is near!\"]\n\nUpon Baahalman's death, he detonates (e.g. vfx_implosion) and a conduit of energy is directed to you.\n\n-NOTE:the conduit of energy represents the integration of Baahalman's essence into your mind. He will remain there, dormant, except for certain moments in which he breaks free and speaks to you, offering advice and abilities. Baahalman is not truly your enemy anymore, as he believes you now serve the empress like him, since she follows you. Some abilities that come in can be unique, such as the ability to Soullink, which is where you channel a conduit to an ally. The empress bids you to lower your weapon, as she means you no harm.\n\n-NOTE:if you choose to attack anyway, she will kill you, no chance of survival. She asks you why you have come. You are confused, as this is your cousin. The \"empress\" looks confused and asks for an explanation. You explain to her of all the events as of late.\n\n-NOTE:for future references, the lich Baahalman was seeking to revive his queen through specific requests to the slavers for female slaves, on which he experimented to perfect the technique of spiritual melding. When it was brought to his attention that a girl (strangely, she was the only one born that day) was born on the calculated date of his rulers reemergence, he set out a plan to ensnare her when she became 11 Metaalian years of age. With this, he trapped the girl and transferred the stored soul of his empress into her body. As a result, the girl's soul was cast out and lost, but since the lich's technique was not perfect, a \"shard\" of the empress' spirit separated and floated free until a \"shard\" of the girls spirit bonded with it, forming a hybrid of sorts. The end product brought about a beautiful young woman, blending the physically beautiful and intimidating qualities of the monarch with the innocent and pure personality of the girl. However, despite this creation's \"attunement\" to both aspects, she really is her own person, and not one or the other of the composers. Combining aspects of both names Alies and Koreliin, the name Amryaa is buried within her mind and is what she tells the character to address her by. However, she retains memories from both sides of the fence, as she knows that the other body was at one time hers and that she was recently a young girl. Within the story, she grows up and finds herself experiencing things 10 years ahead of her time: love, hate, passion, and fury. The queen is appalled when she discovers the methods by which she was resurrected, but advises you that the change is irreversible. Furthermore, she also explains that the imperfect method by which Baahalman utilized the technique destroyed your cousin�s soul irrevocably. Nobody guesses that Amryaa is your cousin until she claims the empress to have stolen her body.\n\n+The assumption is made that this person IS Alies, until a verified source explains the true nature of Amryaa, that she is not truly his cousin, but a byproduct of the faulty transfusion.\n+When the news reaches Amryaa, she is devastated and disappears for a while, eventually leading to a suicide attempt.\n+She can be saved with sensitive words, but otherwise the attempt will succeed and she will die.\n\n-NOTE: Character romances may be activated for either the empress or Amyraa: the empress romance kicks in a little earlier with memories of old and her adapting the new, while the romance with Amryaa kicks in a little later, never really quite climaxing until the end. Keep in mind that most people don�t celebrate a romance with a young 8-year-old-girl. Hence, if you romance the empress, who is in your cousin's body, then it might be okay with you, but others will look at you VERY differently. This is because the empress is attracted to your presence, while Amryaa is considered your younger cousin. You will reminisce with Amryaa of family affairs, but then when you realize that she really is not you cousin, but a different person, the barrier weakens and, if saved from death, Amyraa will initiate the romance with a different character \"voice�. This leads to an awkward romance, as Amryaa is your age, but also the personality of your cousin (had she grown up). However, though it is perfectly legit, morally, and lawfully, it may affect \"your\" view of you.\n\nOne other thing...the empress and Amryaa will NOT get along. Why? The empress stole Amryaas body, hence Amryaa doesn't trust her. Why? Amryaa is closer to the character, having a developed relationship hence the Empress is jealous. On this note, the player and Amryaa embark on a mission to get her real body back from the monarch, the empress decides to follow, as she holds some sympathy for the girl, but at the same time is drawn to the presence of the player, due to his surprising power.\nBesides which, she would rather have the body she once had, since it was the once created in the transfusion, hence, she wouldn't mind changing over; this also leads into the whole power issue, as Amryaa is naturally attuned and skilled with supernatural manipulation vs. the empress and her fragile body. The three head north to speak with Reliar Thipple, a \"prophet\" who leads an anti-nation cult. However, he seems to have some real knowledge, and in that, lies hope for Amryaa. On this note, the chapter ends, and catapults you into the next one.\n\n\n\nUNIQUE ABILITIES:\n\nSoullinking\nDuration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 3 seconds\nDescription:\nWhen soul linking is initiated with an ally, you lose half of your current hit points. The receiver's current hit points are raised (or lowered) to your level and for the designated amount of time, any damage received by you or your ally is distributed evenly. For example, if Jon linked with Sally and Sally was hit for 20 points of slashing damage, then, after Sally's resistances and immunities were factored in, both Sally and Jon would receive 10 points of damage for a total of 20 distributed among them.\n\nEmpire's Hail\nDuration: 2 turns + 1 turn/5 levels\nCasting Time: 1/2 second\nDescription:\nUpon hearing this shout, all allies within a 15' radius are instantly hasted, imbued with a +1 to all saving throws, and given +15 temporary hit points. Very useful in a pinch, this skill will tip the balance in every fight. Unfortunately, it can only be used when the empress is in the party. Furthermore, since this hail is very ritualistic, there is a waiting period of 45 minutes after it is used before it can be used again.\n\nInnocence\nDuration: 8 rounds\nCasting Time: 5 seconds\nDescription:\nSimilar to sanctuary, this skill will cause all enemies nearby to disregard you. However, this skill also allows you to regenerate hit points at a rate of 2 per five seconds for as long as it lasts. Unfortunately, this skill can only be activated after a waiting time of 15 minutes. Furthermore, it can only be used when Amryaa is in the active party.\n\nBaahalman's Dweomer\n(mage class only)\nDuration: Instant\nCasting Time: 18 seconds\nDescription:\nDeveloped and refined over time by the legendary sage, Myrrhal Draewyn, who later became Baahalman, this spell is extremely potent, enabling the caster to obliterate a single enemy, with a successful roll. Upon a successful cast, a roll is made with two d10 dice. If the roll resulting is above 19, then the unfortunate victim is pelted with 10d6 fire damage, 10d6 negative damage, 2d4 electrical damage, and 10d10 bludgeoning damage. If the target is still standing, then a second roll will be made with the same conditions except that the roll must be above 10. If this roll is also successful, then the target is instantly slain. Keep in mind that, during the 35-second cast time, the caster will be susceptible to all attacks. This ability can only be used once a day.\n\nATTUNEMENT:\n\nDuring the course of this adventure, you will gain the presence of some truly powerful identities. Such presences will offer you abilities and knowledge as you travel. However, the downside is that you'll have to, at one point in the game, choose a specific personality to attune yourself to. This will grant you further benefits from your \"mind partner\": Baahalman will buff your supernatural abilities, Nahalik will buff your leadership abilities, and Dentarion will buff your combat abilities. Whomever you choose is up to your playing style and focus.\n\nMODULE CREATOR: David Hummer\nContact: dchummer@adelphia.net\n","Rating":8.3,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"144":{"Name":"Mentor","Author":"Shir'le E.

When she first joins it gave the impression that you�d get to train her and guide her. And several times when talking to her she was asking you questions about what�s going own, asking to explain instead of you asking of NPCs as usual. I quite enjoyed having someone around to look after, someone looking up to me.\n\nThe second was the band of adventurers coming to your keep asking for quests; again a role reversal with NPCs coming to the PC for quests instead of the other way around. And though they were a bit� �comical� I thought there was potential with that idea.\n\nSo taking that together the idea is as follows.\n\nYou play a seasoned afventurer (high level, maybe even level 20). Could even be the PC from the OC. And instead of doing quests for yourself you take this small group of green adventurers under your wing; guiding them, teaching them, influencing them, shaping their personalities, etc.\n\nIt would start simple, with getting them to know their abilities, setting them on simple tasks, etc. But soon a larger plot would emerge that seems an ideal place for them to make a difference (not dangerous enough that the player needs to get involved herself/himself, but enough to give the adventurers a challenge). And as the quests and such become more dangerous the player can choose to help them to higher or lesser degree; though the more help given the less they learn (the less experience they get) and the less prepared they�ll be for future challenges. But at least you�re there to saves their bacon and pull them out the fire.\n\nI can see that the player might pick one favorite among the group, one to make leader and one with whose trainer the player could get more intimately involved (personal sparring session, longer discussions, etc). And I can also see that for the climax of the game things take an unexpected turn for the worse with the �big bad� kidnapping the PC, leaving it to the adventurers to rescue their mentor.\n\nThis would be interesting in the player leaving their impression on a number of NPCs, influencing them towards good or evil, law or chaos and see the fruits of their training and the player�s guidance. And it would make excellent use of the companion system.

Three human groups with good reasons to claim it. Each one of them is firmly convinced that it is defending the Good against Evil. Each group is justificating its own war horror acts under the pretext that the others do worse to them. Retaliation is the rule, craziness the reality. When there is war, they are always business opportunities. Drawen blacksmiths are overselling their weapons and armors, gnome alchemists designed suicide bombs and a strange addictive berseker potion, while the halflings rogues of the Black Market organization send runaway children to loot the corpses as soon they fall.... More people having good reasons to want the war to go on. Elves are the on the defensive, helping druids to protect woods and oasis, but some of them whisper that if humans fight against each other, they are not building mineral cities and logging elven lands...\n\nThis war has been fought for tens of generations now, and it ended up attracting planar attention. Demons saw there a wonderful playing ground and sends there some minions for experience. They occasionally ally with one band or another to ensure none wins, trying to pervert all groups into committing unforgivable war crimes... Angels consider ending this war as the most difficult quest ever and periodically send there emissaries to try to find a way for each group to peacefully accept the other one, but it lasts for so long that this post is considered as an angel � administrative boredom � place where to send inefficient planars. Many angels have fallen into vengeance without having succeeded.\n\nWill you end up with one band, loot them all, serve demons of band with angels peace corps? Is there any end to this war?\n\nYou have a setting for a module through which you will live the reality of war... Lies, totalitarism, cruelty and heroism in the same warrior, amoral war trades, massive war graves, magical war race, use and abuse of preventive strikes, propaganda and desinformation. There is no � good � side, but good, neutral and evil people on every side, even though all of them think they are the good ones. This module should be to neverwinter what � saving private Ryan � had been to Hollywood War Industry : The opportunity to go deep into the meaning of a war, and for sure its absurdity.\n\n\nTHE SETTING\nIt is rumored that Balmur-Ha once had been called � the jewel of the east � and � the city with golden roofs �. Most think this is only a legend told to young children by greedy elven bards, as no grand parents of any elder didn't remember anything but war.\n\nIf you're a human, you will be born in one of the three different suburbs which fight for the destroyed center of Balmur-Ha :\n\nGOLDEN WARLOCKS (NEUTRAL)\nIn the northern Razor Mountains dwell the Golden Warlocks, powerful mages specialized in extracting the gold from their mines manned by golems. They once were the rulers of Balmur -Ha and had been driven out of the city by a wave of terrorism. They consider the Red Knights of Fertiland Hills as bloody terrorists and the Blue Prophets of Infinite Sand as totalitarian fanatics. The Golden Warlocks pretend to fight to recover the lost civil peace, when all communities once lived quietly under the benevolent rule of the Three Wise. But their ennemies consider that what they want to recover is their infinite arbitrary power and the control of the pure gold vein said to run deep under the Sanctuary.\n\nGolden Mages despise physical violence, and raid their ennemy's lands in small groups of war mages. Their problem is their lack of a large population base, as the rocky mountains where they fled had very poor soil, and because magic studies and practise blend poorly with large family raising. They try to overcome this bringing in magic students from all over the world, attracted by their prestigious Razor Mountains Magic Academies. Would-be wizards, sorcerers and warlocks receive there a basic formation and are dispached to the front line. Many consider it as a great opportunity to practise the Dark Arts under the apparently legitimate pretext of fighting against evil behaviour.\n\nBLUE PROPHETS (LAWFUL NEUTRAL)\nOn the other side of the Silver Snow Peaks, where Rocs giant eagles and rock dwraves dwell, is the desert of the Infinite Sand. This has always been the land of the Blue Prophets, an antique sect of elephant caravan drivers, in charge of the business between Balmur-Ha and the rest of Faerun. They had their names because of the blue color of their tunics. Infinite Sand had always been the place chosen by the gods to talk to humans, and Balmur-Ha Sanctuary had been built with Blue prophets money, to honor their deity of trade and prosperity.\n\nBut the city, under the rule of such unbelievers like the Three Wise, began to forgot the wisdom of Blue Prophets. Worse, the demographic pressure from the hordes of peasants born in Fertiland Hills marginated the desert people, soon restricted into their caravan market. To the point that Balmur-Ha people accused them of sabotaging the crops trade to drive Fertiland into poverty and hunger. They took over the Sanctuary and destructed the Blue Prophet statues, to replace them with marble figures of their fertility goddess. It was more than the True Faith of Blue prophets could stand. Their legions of clerics and war monks left their oasis and dunes to bring the wrath of their deity deep into Fertiland county and towards the slopes of the Razor Mountains.\n\nBlue prophets practise polygamy in their desert camps, bringing to life lots of children, which are told that evil mages and fighters tried to enslave their ancestors, and to desacralize their temple. These youngsters could choose to be scimitar clerics, desert monks or Faith Martyrs, a powerful spy who kills himself in the middle of his ennemies with gnomish bombs. Furthermore, zealot worshippers from other countries cross the Infinite Sands to defend the True Faith.\n\nRED KNIGHTS (CHAOTIC NEUTRAL)\n\nRed Knights grew up in the green fields of Fertiland Hills. They used to be peasant serves of the warlocks and desert traders. But crops are generous in the hills, and many children born there moved to settle in Balmur-Ha, where they contacted the Silver Snow Peaks drawes, who sold them weapons and armor, and roamed the land to teach combat arts to the peasants. Soon, a secret organization, the Red Knights, started to be known because they took to the rich merchants to give to poor farmers. They said that Fertiland people had no more to be exploited by the landowners, that they were the majority and as such had the right to rule the land.\n\nRed Knights were moving through Balmur-Ha's sewers, where they broke deals with the Black Market rogue organization, to have them intimidate Blue Prophets traders into selling their business for cheap money to Fertiland investors. At the same time, Red Knights commandos were entering the Golden Warlocks towers and exterminating whole families. Once they piled up enough money, they bought thousands of weapons to the dwarves and prepared for the revolution. The Red Night is Fertiland's national day, commemorating the end of servdom, and the expulsion of the warlocks to the mountains. Soon the revolutionary council turned against the Blue Prophets, who allied with the warlocks to retake the city center. Open conflict ended up turning the Sanctuary and Balmur-Ha center into ruins. \n\nSince then war never stopped. The Red Knights are now the absolute warlords of Fertiland, transforming their fellow farmers into warriors through an obligatory ten years military service. Without trade routes to Faerun (controlled by the Blue Prophets), local economy is a war economy, and crops are often destroyed by rampaging warlocks or prophets rides. War had become the path every man and woman should follow, and children are raised in war academies, trained and endocrinated, and then sent to combat at 15 for men, and 17 for women, after they were forced to have a baby. Reproduction is such an issue that they have been accused to buy sex slaves on the Black Market and to kidnap womens destinated to elite Red Knights harems. Their fertility goddess now wears a sword and full plate over her pregnant belly. Each Red Knight has the right of life and death over its recruits (synonim of citizens). Some of them could be kind, other perverse, but all of them are violent and proud of their killings. Sometimes, intestine wars between Red Knights bring even more disorder to this violent land.\n\nGRAY PICK ROCK DWARF\nGreedy Red Pick tribe had lived in the Siver Snow Peaks long before the first man came to this region. They were the owners of the first gold mines of Balmur-Ha, trading with Faerun with tamed Roc giant eagles. Then the first mages came there, settle with the dwarves, and learned their mining secrets. Soon they used magic to uncover new veins in the closeby Razor Mountains slopes, where they put hundreds of constructs at work. \n\nRed Picks turned then towards cold iron and adamantine mining, and developed a strong weapons and armor trade through the Blue Prophets elephant caravans. They had grown such a strong resentment against the warlocks who stole their secrets that they incited Fertiland peasants into rebellion. Now, they have open shop all around Balmur-Ha and their trade is flourishing. Some say that they even secretly settled into the Sanctuary catacombs to exploit a former white gold (platinum) vein discovered by the warlocks.\n\nORANGE APOTHECARY GNOME GUILD\nThe orange robe of BB dealers is known all over Balmur-Ha. They sell BB, the Bravery Berbage, a strongly addictive potion that turns everyone into a fearless berseker. Nobody knows for sure how the Apothecary Gnome Guild got to the city, but now their rabbit-like tunnels show up everywhere, \nvomiting hundreds of discreet gnomish street dealers. Their trade is so popular that they have been making huge benefits. Strangely enough, this money is nowhere to be seen, as there is no marble gnomish palace around Balmur-Ha. Rumors state that they have an underground palace where silver rivers run under pure ruby bridges. Some Black Market thieves are said to have used their tunnels as an escape. None came back.\n\nBLACK MARKET THIEVES\nThis organization is under the control of halfling guildmasters. They run an open marketplace in the middle of a no-man's land near Balmur River docks. There everything is for sale, stolen magic, monstrous familiars, catacomb bones, and even human slaves. If a character dies, he would have to buy his equipment back from the Scavenger Guild, who send children to the battlefield to loot the corpses. This is where thieves and assassins come to talk business. Times are hard for outlaws, though, as they are slowly driven out of their catacombs traditional dwellings by an invisible power... A shame, because the catacombs subterranean corridors connect all Balmur-Ha suburbs, allowing thug gangs to move freely...\n\nThe halfling guildmasters suspected the Orange Gnomes gangs to be responsible, and captured a handful of them who sadly died under a �reasonable amount� of salvage torture, without any information. The Apothecary Guild protested strongly and threatened the Black Market to have its supply of BB cut if the torturers were not hung. A handful of low-ranks assassins were caught and hung, and the BB trade went on.\n\nThe Black Market docks are the perfect place to visit to understand war economy. There you could see clandestine Blue Prophets dealing with a corrupt Red Knight to buy some peasants as adepts. Politics often take place in secret Black Market alcoves. The main tavern of the Docks is ran by a crazy mage. Local sport is brawling there. You can fight for experience with chairs, bottles and tables, but after the fight, all the knocked-out contenders have to pay for the broken furniture. \n\nTHE YELLOW DEATH WITCH\nShe is the secret force gaining back the catacombs. Truth is that she needs it to store her army. She is collecting corpses from Balmur-Ha battlefields to prepare the largest undead army Faerun had never seen. She came here from her fever-infested swamp attracted by the legendary death rate of Balmur Ha among necromancers like herself. But before converting the corpses into undead, she strips them from their vital fluids and in her caldron prepares a yellow potion, which she sells to her Orange Gnomish minions, to be sold as BB... \n\nThe Yellow Witch is the one extracting platinum from the hidden vein. She settled deep behind the Sanctuary, in places long ago forgotten. There her zombie miners cave continuously platinum, which she uses to pile up armor and weapons.\n\nTHE GREEN NATURE WORSHIPPERS\nThey occupy the dense woods separating Razor Mountains from Fertiland Hills. Culture there is elvish, but wood elves rangers have also learned from human druids who settled among them. They see this ongoing war a s a total waste of life,but consider that it has also the advantage to limit Fertiland expansion towards the woods. This is the only place in Balmur-Ha where you would not find a single BB dealer. \n\nThey recently came to the conclusion that a force against the living is growing from under the Sanctuary. They don't know exactly what it is, but they start to build up forces against what lies there.\n\nPLOTLINE HINTS\n\nThe idea would be that characters will start in different locations depending on their race/class elections. A starting script could do the trick.\n\nExample :\nA human fighter would probably be spawn as a Red Knight\nClerics will probably have ventured to participate in the Blue Prophets crusade, and mages to study Golden Warlock war magic.\nOther classes would probably had been brought as slaves and would start in the Black Market Slave Market. They would be �bought� by some of the factions' members... (So as to have 3 different starts)\n\nSome character combinations may offer a choice. It could be handled through a narrator dialog.\n\nBasic idea is that the character (1st level) will start in a place where he would be given his first missions and also will learn about the war from the point of view of his faction. Around 5th level, he would be sent to the frontline.\n\nZones around the sanctuary are devastated ruins of what was once a city. They are no man's lands, and every time a character enters such a zone, there is a highly probable spawning of at least two opposing groups fighting there. Levels of NPCs would be calculated to offer a dangerous challenge to the adventurer. Also some �moral choice� opportunities would be randomly spawn, with alignment shifting and/or xp rewards.\n\nBut the first time the character steps into no man's land, he would serve in his faction's band, and would end up unconscious, and be stripped of his uniform/equipment by scavenger thiefs. His body would be collected by an adversary faction, and he would wake up in the hospital of his ennemies. He / She would have to learn fast how to behave, and will discover horrors commited by his clan.\n\nThere would come the main plot's choice (�mission�). The character will be sent to a mission into the Black Market and will have to deal with Fouleye, the crazy wizard owner of the Black Market tavern. Fouleye will soon become their new information and quests provider. The characters will discover that he is much wiser than he may seem. Through him, they would have the opportunity to chat with good and evil planars.. They would then have to make their choice that will decide of their victory condition (In a multiplayer game, each player should make its individual choice\n\n-Good : Succeed into bringing peace into this disorder, through diplomacy and fight. (without losing a good alignment!)... Quite a challenge...\n-Evil : Help the Yellow death to collect 6 000 corpses and eventually take the witche's place.\n-Neutral : Make money through the war : settle at Fouleye's tavern and amass 1,000,000 GP.\n\nWhatever choice you make, you will have to travel trough all the different settings of Balmur-Ha to complete them : Dwarves mines, gnome tunnels, Elven woods, Undead catacombs, and desert, hills and moutains. You would probably end up addicted to BB (+3 str, -5 AC when under effect, -2 int, -2 con, slowed during 10 hours after the effect), the cheapest potion of all, especially as you will discover that gnomes cadaver collectors imbue their darts with BB...\n\nThe first player to complete his victory condition wins (around level 15), and brings up an animated dialog with Fouleye that concludes the campaign.","Rating":8.3,"Votes":5,"Awards":["ModuleIdeaWinner.jpg"]},"146":{"Name":"Lone Wolf","Author":"Oliver Melendez","Submitted":20061113,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Single Player","Game":"NWN","Short Description":"A game based on the books of Joe dever","Description":"You are a Kai master out to avenge the atrocities of the Dark Lords of Magnamund.

Stay tuned for more screenshots. Please don't hesitate to comment.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nAs daylight grew dim, the gardener was walking back to the greenhouse to lay down his shears. I need to sharpen those, he told himself. Oil them too. He couldn�t stand anymore their screeching when he cut the rose hedges.\n\nHe had worked outdoors all day again today, under a low, grey sky. A cold, annoying mist spat down incessantly, refusing to turn into rain. The gardener however liked how this weather coloured the lawns, the garden flowers and the bricks of the Duke�s castle a deeper, sullen hue. It also kept most everyone else indoors, and that too pleased him.\n\nThe greenhouse was his home, his sanctuary. It was most of what he could call his own nowadays. Nobody came by much usually. Sometimes the Duchess and her daughter dropped in to inspect their orchids. Sometimes one of the household kids at play would choose the greenhouse as a hiding place, suddenly darting away, frightened, at the sight of the gardener. That unmistakably pinched his heart though, for he had always liked children.\n\nStill hunched against the weather, the gardener reached the heavy door of the greenhouse, stepped through the doorway into his home of glass, and was faced by dozens of clay growing pots inexplicably overturned and broken on the floor, soil spread over the ground, partially burying crushed and broken plants.\n\nThe wind could not have caused this he knew; the greenhouse windows and door had been firmly shut. One of the children, the Duke�s dog? He doubted it. No one from the household, he was convinced, would have done such a thing.\n\nClosing the door behind him, he lit a candle from a nearby shelf against the growing obscurity.\n\nNow turning towards the interior of the greenhouse and the rows of growing plants, the gardener suddenly tensed, alert, as his fist tightened on the handles of his rusty shears.\n\nThe pots had by all appearances been rudely brushed off the centre-row table, to make room for what he now saw there: a splayed corpse, arms with hands cut off dropping from the table at the elbows.\n\nRapidly scanning the shadows of the greenhouse, he saw nothing move. He heard nothing. All was silent. Everything else was in its place.\n\nThe gardener carefully approached the body from one side, keeping his eyes on the charred ends of the arms where the hands used to be. Then he noticed in the light of the candle that the corpse�s face had been completely burned, effectively erased. Acid, he thought to himself.\n\nA board hung around the faceless body�s neck like an upside down noose, bearing a message:\n\n�Whatever you do, stay out of this.�\n\nThen the gardener heard the air crackle in the gloom ahead, and in an angry buzz, they came flying straight for him, and fast.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nLater events leave most of the Duke�s household and guard lying in their own blood, and a local population in panic. Between deceit and unthinkable evil, in the midst of forces each trying to gain from the crisis, you, as the gardener, a former mercenary and bounty-hunter who had only wanted to leave that life behind, are plunged into a quest to find answers, meaning, save one of your own blood and perhaps even a soul.\n\nWhy was the Duke and his household a target?\n\nWho sent you the grizzly warning, and why?\n\nWho committed these atrocities?\n\nFind out in \"The Garden of All Evils\", a NWN2 campaign that could one day begin production.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nMy favourite modules are those that make me feel I am playing through a suspenseful fantasy novel or film. Being story-driven, The Garden of All Evils modules would therefore be fairly linear, though there would be a number of optional and circumstantial side quests all directly linked to the main story. Some decisions would also affect whether some scenes or quests are activated or not.\n\nSetting is to be determined, though I guess it could be set in the Forgotten Realms. To be consistent with the main protagonist�s background, starting character level would probably be in the mid-level range (6-9).\n\nA variety of henchmen would come in and out of the PC�s party as the story evolves. The action would be well paced, exciting and completely relevant to the story. Many battles would be monumental.\n\n-----------\n\nSee comments below for further details on the mod. Beware, they contain major spoilers.","Rating":8.81,"Votes":6,"Awards":[]},"148":{"Name":"Avatar Resize","Author":"Gwindor of Nargothrond","Submitted":20061113,"Updated":20061203,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Game":"NWN","Short Description":"Two or more factions have a symbolic representative whose size can vary. As a faction gains members or material advantage, its symbolic avatar will grow or shrink. At a suitable concluding point, the avatars will be released to battle each other.","Description":"Note: after the contest was over, I edited this description slightly, for clarity. It is not a blueprint for a whole mod, just an idea for a mod.\n\nI understand that NWN2 models can be arbitrarily scaled at will. This interesting hook reminded me of an ancient TV show (\"Night Gallery,\" I think) where a man killed a small household spider. He saw the spider again the next day, but it was larger. He killed it, but it came back larger the next day. This continued until the now-giant spider killed him. By itself, this would make a pretty boring module, but it could be spiffed up as follows.\n\nFor example, suppose there was a town composed of Tyr-worshippers and Asmodeus-worshippers. In the central square, avatars (look-alikes) of Tyr and Asmodeus stand. The player works to aid one or the other of these factions. As people are converted to the Tyr faction, Tyr grows. As Asmodeus worshippers are neutralized or killed, Tyr grows. And ditto the reverse. Tyr's size would scale as (Default Size)*(N_tyr/N_asmo), where the N are the number of people that worship that particular deity. Asmodeus's size would scale as (N_asmo/N_tyr). The gaining or losing of particular weapons or magical artifacts could also be thrown into the formula. \n\nIn a multi-player setting there could be more than two factions with more than two avatars.\n\nAt some climactic point, the avatars are released to battle each other, with the player(s) wading in to help as best they can. The early phases could be split into (1) the persuasion stage, with lots of conversations and extra errand-running to be done, followed by a stage where (2) hostilities break out and battle prowess becomes crucial.\n\nIf I were to make this idea into a module, a good plot hook would be a prophecy, cast in stone and placed where the avatars stand. The prophecy would warn of the \"day of reckoning\" to come. There could also be built-in reversals of fortune: e.g. a boatload of paladins arrives in the nick of time; or a portal opens and imps pour through.\n","Rating":7.5,"Votes":5,"Awards":["ModuleIdeaWinner.jpg"]},"149":{"Name":"Barsaive","Author":"syn_2xs","Submitted":20061113,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Persistent World","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Earth Dawn setting of Barsaive that has recently emereged from the scourge.","Description":" The heroes of today are the legends of tomorrow.\n�King Varulus III of Throal\n\nWe live in an Age of Legend.\nAfter centuries of hiding beneath the earth, humanity has ventured out into the sunlight\nto reclaim the world. Trolls, dwarfs, elves, orks, and humans live side by side with\nexotic races: the lizard-like t�skrang, the small, winged windlings, and the earthen obsidimen. Creatures both magical and mundane dwell once more in the forests and jungles. Arcane energies offer power to those willing to learn the ways of magic. Once, long ago, the land grew lush and green. Thriving forests sheltered plants and animals, and people grew and prospered off the land�s bounty.\n\nThen the Horrors came and drowned the world in darkness.\n\nThe world�s flow of magic rose, and at its height, dread creatures from the darkest depths of astral space crossed into our world, leaving suffering and destruction in their wake. The world�s inhabitants Named these fell creatures the Horrors. They laid our world to waste in a terrible time now known as the Scourge. The lush forests died. Bustling towns vanished. Beautiful grasslands and majestic mountains became blasted, barren terrain, home to the Horrors� twisted mockery of life. The Horrors lusted to destroy all life, but they did not succeed. Before their coming, the magicians of the Theran Empire warned the world, and the people of the Earth took shelter under it. They built fantastic underground cities called kaers and citadels; their children and their children�s children grew up within these earthen enclaves, never seeing the light of the sun. For four hundred years the Horrors roamed the land, devouring all they touched while the people hid in terror, until the slow ebb of the world�s magic forced these loathsome creatures to retreat to the astral pit that spawned them. The Horrors departed before the magicians and wise men had believed they would; the wary people emerged slowly from their kaers, facing the world half in hope that the Scourge had truly ended and half in fear that the Horrors lingered.\n\nThough most of the Horrors had left this world, many remained, inflicting cruel anguish and suffering on other living creatures. As humanity struggles to remake the shattered world, they must combat these remaining Horrors who seek to prolong the destruction and despair of the Scourge. Now, heroes travel the land, rediscovering its lost legends and exploring its changed face. For the world has changed, almost beyond recognition. Many died during the Scourge; the Horrors breached some kaers and citadels and destroyed their inhabitants. Other kaers remain sealed, from unknowable disaster or simple fear; their contents await discovery by bold explorers. Should they find any folk still living within, these brave adventurers may lead such feardarkened souls out to live again in the light.\n\nThe dwarf kingdom of Throal lies at the center of the province of Barsaive. The dwarfs seek to unite Barsaive�s far-flung cities and people under one crown and one banner, the better to repel the advances of the Theran Empire that ruled Barsaive before the Scourge. The Therans returned to the province shortly after the Scourge ended, seeking to bend it again to their yoke, but the people of Barsaive rejected the Therans� iron rule and rallied behind the dwarfs of Throal. Even though they were beaten back, the Therans remain the most powerful empire in the world, and may yet strike again. As Barsaive�s heroes search for lost treasures and battle fantastic creatures, they must also fight those who plot to rob Barsaive of its newfound freedom and make its people pawns of a new empire. In the Age of Legend, heroes band together to fight the Horrors and reclaim the wounded world for those born in it. As they explore the altered land, searching for legendary cities and treasures, they become the legends that will light the coming days. As with those who went before them, tales of their deeds will live forever in men�s hearts. From many paths, the heroes come to join in common cause. Those who seek honor and glory come from many Disciplines, and battle evil to redeem the world with a multitude of gifts.\n\nA band of heroes may include an Illusionist, a spellcaster who combines deception and reality to confuse those around him; a Swordmaster, one trained in the art of fighting with bladed weapons; or a Beastmaster, able to train and command the beasts of the earth and sky. The world holds countless heroes, but all share one trait: a willingness to fight to reclaim the world from that which threatens it. Through noble deeds and sacrifice, the heroes of the world will forge its future.\n\nThe World of Earthdawn Earthdawn is a roleplaying game designed for two to eight players. Like many other roleplaying games, Earthdawn has an open-ended style of play. That is, the game has no definitive ending, no preset time limit or number of turns of play, and no single goal that, when achieved, marks the end of the game. Unlike other types of games, however, there is no winner or loser. The object of the game is to have fun while exercising your imagination. When this happens, everybody wins.\n\nThe world of Earthdawn is one of legend. Its people and places are larger than life, the stuff of song and saga. Heroes fight the monsters of this and other worlds; their bold exploits light a beacon of hope for the future, as word of their deeds spreads across the troubled, fearful land. Earthdawn is a world of high adventure, high magic, and terrible danger. Those dangers lurk not only within long-forgotten kaers, but also within the minds of people forever corrupted by the Horrors. To rebuild its heart and soul as well as its outward aspect after the devastation of the Scourge, the world needs heroes. The players of Earthdawn, by creating their characters and playing the game, provide these heroes. In contrast to many other roleplaying games, characters in Earthdawn do not simply survive each adventure and become a little smarter or a little richer. Earthdawn adds another dimension to roleplaying; its characters become heroic figures, accomplishing deeds so impressive that generation after generation will honor their memory in song and story.\n\nThe world of Earthdawn brims over with legends, heart-stirring tales of famous adventurers told by the fireside to while away the night. Earthdawn player characters can become the figures in those legends. As they build their characters� legends through play, they create the fireside tales that their descendants will tell about them. Gaining this heroic stature through daring deeds is as important a part of playing Earthdawn as any lesser gain in riches or experience.","Rating":4.95,"Votes":12,"Awards":[]},"150":{"Name":"To Save A Friend","Author":"Netaria","Submitted":20061113,"Updated":20061204,"Category":"Single Player","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"After escaping slavery you and your best friend must travel to the capitol of the empire which had enslaved you in order to rescue another from a worse fate.","Description":"You have been living life as a gladiator for almost a year when your best friend, Boromir, rescues you. After getting away you find out that when the Empire sacked your town you were only one of many sold into slavery. However there is only one other that hasn't been freed by your friend yet, your cousin, Alea.\n\nThrough the contacts Boromir has spent the last year creating and nurturing he has found that Alea's beautiful face doomed her to sale in the pleasure districts of the capitol. The two of you can get to her with a much better hope of getting her out than either of you alone. The two of you gear up and head out to the capitol to rescue her, which helps to keep you hidden as no one would expect an escaped gladiator to head into the heart of the empire.\n\nUpon arriving and sneaking into the House where she worked you find that a wealthy politician has purchased her for himself. Complicated as this makes things it only gets worse when you find that he is one of the Empire's Mage Generals.\n\nYou realize you will need help and set about attempting to align a group to your cause. There are several choices which you can attempt to woo to your cause: the local thieve's guild, a rag tag government resistance group, or a band of gypsies who owe that particular general a few scars.\n\nYou mount your offense and infiltrate the estate of Mage-General Asceron with the help of your allies. Will you succeed and rescue your cousin, Alea or will she remained doomed to slavery?\n\n~~~~~~~\n\n\nYour character grew up in a moderately sized village known as Summersdale, along with Boromir, Alea, and many others. The village was mainly farmers occasionally graced by a few hunters and trappers and home to a singular Inn and Tavern, The Flying Pig.\n\nSummersdale was in a sort of free-lands where the king of the nation never bothered to turn his eye. Life was fair and there was enough toil to keep the folk busy. When rumors reached Summersdale of an Empire coming across the land eating up all the countries they came across it was largely shrugged at. The neighboring nation prided itself on it's warriors, surely they would turn this Empire away.\n\nSadly, they did not.\n\nOn the day you were taken along with most of the others from your village still alive your people had had no chance. You were drug out of your bed on your family's farm before dawn along with your parents. You saw your mother die as she attempted to take on the trained soldiers herself; common sense over-ruled by the hot blood of her mountain up bringing. The only act of mercy you know of by the soldiers that spoke in a tongue that at that time you did not understand, but after your year fighting in the pits you speak fluently, was allowing your father to take the comb from your mother's hair and you the bear totem that hung about her neck.\n\nAs they separated you out from the others and put you in a cage with other strong young people that headed across your neighboring country and back to the source of the Empire you kept watching for a face you recognized. Finally you found one. Vera, a girl a few years your senior who had lived on the other side of Summersdale was in the cage as well. The two of you stuck together and despite the differing years that had separated you before you became fast friends and were even sold into the pits together. However, Vera fell in the pits to a friend's blade. A week later, you took his life. The wound is only a month old when our story truly opens. When you awaken one night to see Boromir, his black eyes dancing with unshed tears, standing over you in your cell.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\n\nBoromir was always a silver tongued devil and he has put this talent to good use after the capturing of Summersdale. He has focused himself wholly on saving his people and the wit that was that of a fop has been honed into a sharp and piercingly analytical mind. He has grown without souring however and retains a touch of his sillyness. Black hair and equally black eyes have changed as well. Once short hair has grown and is swept back in a cord at his neck; eyes that sparkled with mischief now glimmer and shine with intelligence. Now a master of his twin daggers, sneaking, and fast-talk he has no idea what he will do with himself after you two finish rescuing Alea, no longer the mere farmer's lad he once was. Though, maybe he will find his calling amongst whomever you work with to free her. (That will depend on the type of relationship you forge with the group.)\n\nAlea was the fairly typical daughter of a farming family. She was no frail flower, but not about to sign up for the militia either. What made her truly stand out was her beautiful face, which others might have been happy to trade on, but she found more trouble than use from it. She always read stories of adventurers: mages, knights, wild rangers and barbarians; the run of them all. She always wished for goings on in small Summersdale, but could hardly have predicted how things would work out for her. Her extremely beautiful face and quick mind worked together to save her life. The soldiers in charge of the slaves quickly realized that if kept in pristine condition she could be worth more to them than the rest of the lot combined. So she was separated, fed well, and kept clean. Brought to the very capitol itself and sold to the House of Ianthe Marcolestre. (I am going to leave off about Alea there because a part of the story will be discovering the goings on of Alea's life in the House, etc. --not in a perverse manner, lol.-- So any more would be a spoiler.)","Rating":7.95,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"151":{"Name":"College of Wizardry","Author":"jesterhat102","Submitted":20061113,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Other","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"College of Wizardry 2nd ed.","Description":" My favorite DND product of all time was a campaign expansion entitled \"College of Wizardry\" written by Bruce R. Cordell. I would like enter this as a module idea as I think it is easily adaptable to the toolset and could provide for for an expansive campaign for magically inclined classes. It would probably be relocated to the realms but that wouldn't necessarily hamper the storline as Shard in the current realms would probably prove to be a fun diversion. So as I see it the module would open as the character, a fresh 1st level, would have sought apprenticeship and/or employment in the academy and been accepted. The first few quests and whatnot would include training duties and story developement through character interaction and exploration. Followed by eventual alliances with various factions and alignments. From there the storyline would progress as would level entitling the character to more responsibilities and activities. This all culminating in a plot thick with intrigue, places supposedly lost in time throughout the tower and in the surrounding lands(Shard?), a search for tomes from an ancient civilization (nether scrolls?), Necromancy hidden within the academy, secret chambers, defense of the tower verse an unknown foe, ect. ect. The expansion itself offers all most too much to work with and the possibilities allow for a campaign which could be open to further modules.

Instead of one\noverall, engrossing storyline, there would be many stories on a smaller scale. They will be no less epic and adventuresome, but less drawn out and virtually no \"busy-work.\n\"When you start the module, you stand outside of an inn on a dark, stormy night.\nYou enter the inn and, being the friendly person you are, talk to the others in the common area.\nWhen you begin talking to anyone, you learn they have a story to tell. The\nmodule then transports you into the tale; you become the character to whom\nyou were speaking.\nThat does not mean the quests will be completely linear; the player would make\ndifficult decisions which will affect the outcome of the story.\nThe beauty of this idea is to try new things. Instead of basing a module on one idea, the module can be based on many. This lets you do the ordinary to the outstanding. So far I have thought of the following tales: a fallen prince, cast out by his brother; an interdimensional war; meeting law and order to play as judge and jury; and maybe pay homage to Baldur's Gate I, II, and NWN. There should be others, as the Inn of Tales should have many diverse stories.\nAnother thing I want is to have users replay the module. This can be done by\ncreating tales that cater to specific classes. Examples: a mage who will only tell his tale to a magic user; a bard who will only share his source of inspiration with another bard; a druid who does not trust any but her own kind. Not only will this emphasize replayability, it will also get players to try new classes.","Rating":8.4,"Votes":9,"Awards":["ModuleIdeaWinner.jpg"]},"153":{"Name":"Bad Moon a Risin'","Author":"Eat2surf","Submitted":20061113,"Updated":20061114,"Category":"Multiplayer (1-4 Players)","Game":"NWN2","Short Description":"Life's a Beach - Then you die","Description":"Events in town lead you to a coastal port village... arrival finds the port village completely abandoned.. but with all the everyday stuff left behind.. they obviously left in a hurry.. but without any sign of a struggle..

And yet Dwarven characters have to take the exotic weapon proficiency to gain access to the Dwarven War Axe, a weapon whose very name points to a connection. It stands to reason that a racial proficiency be provided. A good case could be made for the war hammer and the battle axe, but all I really ask for is the Dwarven War Axe. If something has already been done to address this, please let me know.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"167":{"Name":"Demon Cards And Undead","Author":"Jason McFann","Submitted":20090516,"Updated":20090516,"Category":"Other","Game":"NWN","Short Description":"Expanding My Worlds","Description":"Ok as some of you know I created and uploaded the Undead and Undead 2 Hell Quest Modules.

Not only that but I will also be releasing my Demon Cards Bar & Grill module I've been working on for about a year as an added bonus for those of you who have stuck with me this far I would like to thank you.

I'm still working on it (I'm 15, cut me some slack). It's supposed to be a NWN Dead Space-ish horror survival.

The gods chose to ignore this strange event, as they were concerned about the Spellplague at the time. However, it became clear to them that this was no idle threat, when a prized world of the gods, known as Oxorin was rent asunder, leaving fragments scattered throughout the realm. Some witnesses of this event claimed that a mysterious hooded being weilded the force, however, this being eluded even the gods. 50 years later, and all but hushed whispers remained of the tale. In the present era, there are ominous signs of a dark force gathering in great numbers.
