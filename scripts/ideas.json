The situational use of this is to add dramatic effect, when say as part of a plot the PC encounters a badly injured NPC and might choose to help/heal them or not. When healing a bruised and bloodied NPC, I would simply use scripting to swap out the clothing item with a lesser degree bruised and bloddied effect, or with a normal healty look (all based on swapping clothing) Human male and female normal phenotype needed first, others races and phenotypes would be a nice addition. Another nice addition would be to mimic in the form of a helmet, a bruised and bloodied version the various head models. (also be nice if the +1 concentration was NOT a part of the helmet.)

I figured it out, it's called the Magi Warrior. Now There are things I want to do that are not possible at the moment with class creating, but I wanted to show my idea and see if I could get any help and suggestions. The Magi Warrior is like a Paladin, except they cast Arcane magic instead of Divine. Like Paladins and Rangers, Magi Warriors get a set of spells each spell level. They cannot learn new spells from scrolls and they do not choose their spells. Magi Warriors have the advantage over wizards because of their fighting capabilities and the fact that they have an automatic 'Still-Spell'-like feat that has no spell-level penalty. Hit Die: 1d10 Alignment Restrictions: None Requirements: None(Meant to be a pure class) Advantages: -Can cast arcane magic with no failure even when wearing armor or shields -Can learn Fighter and Wizard feats -Has all fighter starting featsDisadvantages: -No Familars, no Summon Creature Spells of any type(This inculdes 'Gate', 'Create Undead', etc.) -Cannot learn spells that increase AC like 'Shield', 'Mage Armor', 'Barkskin', 'StoneSkin', etc.(Maybe not even Minor Globe of Invurenability, perhaps not even Saving Throw increasing spells will be allowed either) -Cannot learn metamagic feats nor multi-class with any other arcane spell-casting classes I have an idea for a spell chart which is like the Paladin/Ranger chart except because the Magi Warrior does not have special abilities, they gain the ability to memorize 1 level-0 spell at level-1, but they can only go up to level-4 or 5 spells(Haven't decided which yet).

I'm sure this has been brought up before, but one thing I'm surprised nobody has done (unless they have) is to tweak the model hierarchy. A separately animated neck is pretty pointless. Modify all the Torso models to include the neck. Then have the neck be a basic male or female head for each race, with no hair or facial hair. Then, create a bunch of models of hair/facial hair that don't animate, and are linked to the old neck model. Those would be user selectable, just as heads are now. Then, create helm models that are open faced. They'd replace the hair, and the existing helm models would work fine as well, so long as they cover the basic head model. NWN supports head swapping as is, and that's all you're really changing, since the models' head is actually its neckFaces could be changed by adding different skins to them ala tattoos, which are entirely different textures. Don't get me wrong, it's a LOT of work, as you'd have to modify all player animations (Not as bad as it sounds. Just rename the head on the player animation files to be the neck, and delete the neck entirely. Then add a duplicate head with no animation, just a link to what's not the neck), as well as all the armour and torso models for every race (Again, not so bad. Most of the models are duplicated. Texture could be a headache, though, as I don't think Aurora can handle multi/subobject textures). It's a big job, but it IS possible without any engine modifiactions. Just a lot of elbow grease and a HAK file. I don't personally care enough about it to do it myself (even if I had the time) but I'm sure enough people do (as with everything) that a small team could be put together, no problem. It's not hard to do, so if you want open-faced helms so badly, add them in yourself.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"74":{"Title":"A tileset suitable for using as the Gnoll stronhold for the Baldurs Gate mod","Author":"blindhamster","Submitted":20040113,"Updated":20040113,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"needs to be kinda like the gnoll stronghold","Type":"Tilesets","Description":"okay well this is for the baldurs gate module being made... we cant find a suitable tileset although we can find things in a few, what it needs is a large fort (like the one from the ruined castle hak, needs a dirt texture, and the ability to make a brige also.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"75":{"Title":"A way to implement a ferry and other moving placeables that a PC can stand on.","Author":"0100010","Submitted":20030614,"Updated":20030614,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Moveable placeables","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"A placeable (a ferry boat to be precise) that can be walked on and can move.

I would greatly appreciate anything that modellers could create for this project. Specificially, I am seeking to implement the following three things into my module: - Grey Alien (a.k.a. Zeta Reticulian), your typical spindly black-eyed and grey-skinned alien, about five feet in height. - Elohim (example), preferably with at least two selectable heads (with or without beard), and full colour-selection support for the skin and hair. - Seal of the Elohim, as a placeable symbol to place on floors, walls, and doors.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"117":{"Title":"An Angel type model like in Diablo 2","Author":"Ulef","Submitted":20021004,"Updated":20021004,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"An angel model, like the one in Diablo 2","Type":"Monsters","Description":"Well I'm making a module and I have some 'Dream' areas in it.

The moral being that god is no more a child than man - he just has a lot more power.The adventures can be linear or open ended in that depending on which deity you kill first, second, or third, etc.. will make the other deitys that much stronger and may help or hurt your campaign.

You normally start off as a sorcerer level 2 in modules, not really level 1. As for level 20, being a sorcerer really comes into its own. Here is a tip to becoming a great level 20 sorcerer. If you have Wail of the banshee , buy lots of rings and amulets that increase your charisma, this makes the spell alot harder to resist, killing lots of enemies instantly. You MUST get 'Isaacs greater missile storm'. Use this spell with the 'empower' feature, and whenever you cast this on a target this is what happens: Total missiles cast at level 20 = 20 missiles Damage for each missile = 3-16 Total damage of all missiles combined = 60-320 (Average 190 damage total) Now THATS alot of damage on a single target with only one spell! I've killed Balors by using this spell just once! Can a druid or cleric do this? Yeah right!So your'e up against an enemy that is STILL too tough? For more satisfaction, use 'Time Freeze' and if you are quick, you are able to inflict 120-640 points of damage by casting this spell *twice* before the time freeze wears off! Even the most powerful dragons will be at your mercy now! If you have an invisiblility spell, you can sneak up upon enemies and cast this spell on them to kill them intantly! (Using time freeze first will be also useful!) Any compliments/suggestions/insults are all welcome.

What I'm envisioning is a tileset modification for making pitches/stands/concession stands/etc, and a series of AI scripts that will loosely govern how the game might be played (I say loosely because this IS Blood Bowl, it has rules and everything, but any game where part of the object is killing the opposition can be considered fairly 'fast and loose') Big stubling block might be 'the ball' - perhaps a mod of shuriken...? Remember that in early versions of Blood Bowl the ball could be used as a missile weapon. Perhaps new feats for playing blood bowl? Certainly BB players with custom uniforms.

Change this to-- ..., 10/+5 damage reduction, .... Because the NWN world makes +3 weapons much more accessible in the game than in PnP, this damage reduction doesn't benefit players unless it is changed. Also disappointing was this description: Summon Shadow: Once per day, the shadowdancer can summon a shadow. This shadow is extremely difficult to turn and becomes more powerful as the shadowdancer gains levels. Well, the problem with summoned shadows is they don't cast any spells, so instead you are left with a pet that starts out with 19 hp, and ends up with 65 hp at level 8, and who only does 1d3 damage with its nonmagical fists.

I know some would point out that those inside these stuctures are in a different erea and this would be a problem.

I know that would take a lot of lines of coding but nonetheless it would be cool. How feasible would it be to do this. The cloak you put on, say a Cloak of Protection vs. Evil, is on your character like armor. If you change the cloak to something else, say a Nymph Cloak, your character now glows kinda, (the Cha. increase would add to physical features) but you wouldnt give off light or anything. It would take a lot of animation to allow it to sway with the wind like grass does in certain tilesets and for it to move when you drew weapons. For the cloaks that give protection against alignment, I'd guess that the character would have a glow that surrounds the cloak or cape depending on the alignment it gives protection from.I also thought about bracers, when you put on bracers that increase a basic statistic say strength, your character's body grows a little in size, visibly muscular augmented by the bracers. Dexterity he would move more smoothly, and run a litle faster. Charisma your character (hence forth known by the abbreviation Cha.) would have smoother facial features, and the hair would be shinier. When the items that give the effects are removed, your character goes back to his/her original appearance. The same effects would happen with any item that affected something like that, Necklaces or Amulets would be shown on the Cha. It's just me thinking about the character design and how it could be improved.

Using the Henchman's script for Tommi the Thief as an example..tell me which parts I need to replace with specific details for my module. Naturally, the author gets full credit for these.

Followed by rolling a percentile dice to see if the female gets pregnant or not.If the female gets pregnant as the time in game passes <6 months in game> the skin of the female will grow large and decreases in stats and would become permanent for the pregnancy because of being pregnant, as time grows closer and closer to 9 months of in game time she will have even more decreases to stats including being slowed. A percentile dice is rolled when 9 months hit, if it rolls high enough she drops to the ground and goes into labor which hopefully she isn?t in combat. If it rolls low then next day it rolls again until it rolls high then she goes into labor. After about 3-4 minutes on the ground a random male or female boy spawns with NPC control for the mother It wouldn?t be very practical unless it was for a NWN Persistent world, but it would definitely add another aspect of gaming.

But using them together can require almost as much scripting as writing each one. This is something that sadly I cannot do and I think I am not the only one. For example, Knat from the PW site (www.funkylizard.com/nwn) has put together a great tool for scripter that reduces redundancy and therefore would lower lag and crashes if used. But there are several great spawning systems, rulesets, etc. that do not use these functions and use a lot of Heartbeat scripts. The result is that if you use them all, you can slow a PW to a crawl. The other option is to use Bioware standard triggers, etc. which may not use as many resources but provide less than optimum results . So in this example, if someone were to take some of the various systems out there and make them compatable with Knat's tokenizer, that would be great.There are just countless tools available now that would be twenty times more usable if made to work with others. I guess I am talking standards. Probably what would be best is if all the major players in the community were to find one place to coordinate and form a sort of Commitee of NWNStandards, this would create the kind of thing I am talking about. Hell, how about devoting a board here at the vault to just that. Invite all who have and are creating major content, ask them to post at least once a week on what they are doing and what they have discovered and what they may have to change to fit with other projects, etc. Of cause anyone can continue to make whatever comes to mind. The individual think is what makes great things. But if there were some level of coordination of efforts, we would get so much further. Think of it if all the guys from the various PWs pooled their resources!

The character in turn has to find a way out gather their items back and escape the iincarseration.I ask this cause it is too easy to just kill off all the npc's in the game, (checking the plot in the advaced tab of the creature properties is good too) but it would make it more interesting to be on ones toes if you know your character will go to jail if caught in that town/city.

I?ve broken these tilesets into groups to better illustrate the different environments. Here's what I would like to see combined into a fully working pack: Rural Section: City/Rural with Grass and Hills Rural/Forest with Hills Exotic Section: Jungle Jungle City Tropical Winter Section: Winter Rural with Hills Snow Mountain/valley Winter Forest Wasteland Section: Desert City Lava Mountains Valley/Mountain/Underground (with Lava) Dungeon/CityDungeons Section: LOK Dungeon Velmar's Dungeon Drow Temple Other Section: Arcane Space (Tilesets & Placeable Only) Underwater Plane of Cheese Shadow Rural This list may seem long, but it?s purpose is to supply a hak pak that would provide a PW with a large variety of environments and lots of expansion room. I did not include the Desert Rural because of the pending expansion from Bioware. If hills are able to be included to the new winter tileset, then I would remove that from this list as well. The main problem for the untalented in the community (read: me), is the combining of .2Das and the editing of .ITP files that you must do to combine these sets.

If so, you might remember a place called the 'Ancient Dungeon' which was comprised of 99 floors of randomized madness. Each time you entered the dungeon reconfigured itself based upon 5 choices for each level (or 495 total layouts). Upon entering you were stripped of your equipment and sent back to level one. You had to then pretty much just find anything you could to equip and fight your way down to the bottom (leveling was massively faster in here compared to the normal game, for a good reason). Around the 20th floor each time, you found an item in one of the chests called 'Providence'. This was your ticket out of the dungeon, so it was your choice to go as deep as you could before you felt the need to use it and go back up. There was no other way out of there except dying, and if you died you lost everything you had found and were sent back up to the top.I'm thinking something like this would be possible with our toolset, perhaps on a smaller or larger scale depending on how much work one wants to put into it.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"586":{"Title":"Energons (Xeg-Yi and Xag-ya)","Author":"Charamei","Submitted":20040110,"Updated":20040110,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Balls of positive and negative energy from the Planes.

Now, I have seen some efforts to correct this defecit, but not nearly enough high level mods are being made as compared to low level mods. I think the reason for this is that low level mods are eaiser to make, as their storylines are much simpler (save a village from some goblins or some such, as opposed to saving entire planes of existence), and hence are also much smaller in scope and detail compared to an epic.I know that module making is a daunting task, and, if I had the time, I would create an epic myself, but I simply don't have the time or the knowledge/skills necessary to do the job, and do it well.

Use the place cards to mark where Points Of Interest would be in relationship to the starting point of the area. Then the PCs can run around looking at the place cards that have a short description of where & what it is (or may be). For example one would say ?A small town? or ?Great Forest?. The PCs simply click on the place that they want to go. In the ?OnUsed? script handler would be a script that would determine the amount of days they would need to travel in relation to the point the PCs entered the map. Lets say the players enter at the maps start point and want to go to a city named ?Somewhere?. They move over to the place card and click it.The attached script would then compute how many days away it is from the start point; witch is where the PCs entered. Lets say it comes up with 4 days travel. The script would then check for random encounters for all 4 days. If it hits on one then the players are taken to one of (Lets say 10) pre-generated random encounter areas. The encounter is then played out. At the end of the encounter they are then taken to their final destination. You would then need to advance the days by 4. After the PC are done in the City ?Somewhere? they would transition back to the Main Map at that cities place card. This would be the new start point for other place cards to determine how many days away they are.

What will happen when the Blood War of the Demons ends? Okay, here�s my idea. I propose to make the biggest epic module ever created for NWN. But I need help. So far, I think that a preset party of six characters, who are level 20, champions of their people , who come to a council in Tethyr. Elminster is going nuts, because the Tanar�ri have succeeded in beating the Baalor demons, and the blood war is over. (I�m not 100% on the details, so help there would be nice). What�s worse is, the late King of Tethyr has been assassinated, and the only heir to the throne still alive is his son, who is in exile. Without a stable leadership, Tethyr could easily fall to a powerful enough invading force, or worse, the Tanar�ri. The overall plot would basically entail the unity of all the people of Torril, as they prepare for the demons of the abyss, who seek to invade Faerun, and use it as a staging platform against Sigil, and then Mt. Celestial.The five or six player characters would be premade, and entail a very specific story. I know that the lack of player choice is too linear, but I�m looking at making an epic and playable story. The main character would be the Child of Bhaal- PLEASE HEAR ME OUT- who has been brought out of his newer, more humble life, to face the threat that is on their doorstep. Romances with NPCs would be included, and I think setting the module to six players only would allow for the group to split up, and depending on what character you play could depend on your course through the story. That would ease the lack of choice, because you can choose which path to follow. If anybody is interested, please, drop me a line. I�m looking to make this really BIG, with loads of custom content, scripts, dialogue, NPCs, newer terrains and such. -Valdae evil_thane@hotmail.com","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"683":{"Title":"Forgotten Realms Maps","Author":"Iapetus","Submitted":20021210,"Updated":20021210,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"A project should be created to make templates for Forgotten Realms based games.","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"The most time consuming portion of being a DM for NWN is the creation of cities.

(1)It check your Lumberjack licence (i made 20 levels to the licence). (2)it checks a key object(s) which in this case would be a lumberjack axe. (3) then it check to see if you suceed it rolls a d20 + the key ablity which is Stength mod for lumberjacking. (4) if sucess then it takes gives you a new lumberjack licence and takes away the old one. (5)gives you a log as your item.This works like most other 'tradeskill' mods, but has seprate skripts for each action. That way it can be modified by newbees much easier. Just seetting the right script on the right tab in the conversation wizard. I have also made it VERY organized EX) skill_a_001, skill_a_002 ... skill_nn_019, skill_nn_020, all you have to do is change one number or letter. Lumberjack is skill_v_001 to skill_v_020.

The action would still centre on the PC, of course, but having a few more henchmen available would help the game greatly, I think - making it a little more like BG. Also, the game would be a LOT more fun to complete if you had discussions running with your various henchmen, as in BG2. It would also be good if there was a way to assume control of a henchman and treat him/her like a PC. So, for example, as an 18th level paladin, I could hire both a thief and a mage to play with.Each henchman would be like a PC controlled by the computer, so when I double click on the portrait of my henchmen on the side taskbar, they would become the user-controlled character, and the previous character (my paladin) would follow him like a henchman, until I double clicked on his portrait again, and turned him back into the player controlled character. This way, you could play as many different classes within the one game, and could get a grasp of all the different abilities of each. I realise this may sound a little bit similar to BG, but the truth is that I really liked that way of doing things, and even though NWN is meant to be different from BG, I think that this feature of it should be kept.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"806":{"Title":"Hidden Name and Health","Author":"daepheus","Submitted":20030518,"Updated":20030518,"Category":"Script","Short Description":"A way to keep names hidden from characters whom you haven't met in game yet.","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"I've always had a problem with the fact that my character's name is billboarded above his head in bright green letters.

What if it would be possible to setup NWN on a second computer for Multiplayer ONLY. And this to work ONLY as a single extra machine on a LAN. Thus it would be possible to have your kid play Multi with you on your home LAN. The idea comes from how 3D Studio Max does their serial numbers. Base number is a 30 day trial. Another type S/N is Educational, and a 3rd is Full Commercial. All using the same exact software. NWN could do something similar. Have a CD Key that ONLY allows a single extra Multi on a LAN with an authorized active server. It also would permanently lock out single play and internet play on that machine. This could allow a friend or another family member to play a casual game together on a LAN. Internet friends could still join in with legit CD keys as those are checked on the internet servers. Since the new Key would also lock out Single play, it wouldn't be viable for hacks and such.The positive side of this is that casual multi on LAN only games would be possible without extra cash, the developer would get good PR as well as the publisher. Those that want to do heavy online games together would still need 2 (or more) full copies, Whereas the casual gamer wouldn't buy the second copy anyway.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"851":{"Title":"Idea: How to walk onto ships and steer and attack from them!","Author":"jimmyn","Submitted":20030709,"Updated":20030709,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"I have an idea of how to walk onto ships and steer and attack from them, and I'd really love it if it was created!","Type":"Improvement","Description":"The first thing to do would be to create a placable ship, with the appropriate animations (rocking) Also, the placable should be walkable on the deck, or any other ladders or whatnot you have on the ship.

Eliminate/change the feat requirement in alertness (to something more useful, such as lightning reflexes). To take into consideration these reductions, require a +6 base attack. Add/Change these abilities, keeping in mind the Harper Scout is receiving resources, training, and knowledge from the Harper society: Give 8 skill points per level instead of 4.

When I say 'one-way visible' I mean, if you have the camera set further up above the character, you could see through the ceiling (100% transparent), and when you had the camera lower, it would appear as though the roof actually exsisted.

The player must scavenge among flotsam and debris for useful items. Upon scouting the island the player must unlock an ancient entrance leading underground. A vast network of underground worlds is revealed, and it becomes clear that the player must travel through them to have any hope of getting off the island.Some caverns are deep, dark and foreboding, filled with drips and squeeks. Others, lighted by lichen and bioluminescent rock, are as bright and clear as the earth above. Whole civilizations await the player's discovery...some evil and opportunistic, others helpful and necessary to move the player homeward bound. Subplot ideas are nearly infinite, as the character encounters strange customs and unfamilair societies. Ultimately the designer can have the player remain in these persistent worlds, forever searching for a way home....or build the conclusion that leads the player out of the journey to the core.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"905":{"Title":"Jousting Hak","Author":"Lozza","Submitted":20030517,"Updated":20030517,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Jump on a horse and joust!","Type":"Additions","Description":"Once upon a time, this man went to market to buy a horse.

The result is a pouch which is full of random items, and the items KEEP CHANGING AROUND. The silver bauble in your pouch today may not be there tomorrow - but who knows what you may get instead? Basically, the script would create random items from a given list inside the pouch, and switch, say, three items at random with new items every day.It would be wonderful if this script could be designed to: * Slip a specific, prearranged item into the pouch at a certain point in the plot. * Be adjustable, in such a way that the change rate (random items switching) can be slowed down or speeded up according to time/area, so that, say, all the contents of your pouch change when you're at a marketplace during the day, and there's almost no change when you're camping in the forest at night. * Allow the script to choose between different lists of items, according to area (i.e. in the forest, you'll find a pretty flower in your pouch, and in the castle, you'll find the queen's hairbrush...) Obviously I'm not asking for the creation of such complicated lists - just for it to be possible for me to create one easily.

Tell the loan shark how much you want, and he gives it to you, telling you when to pay him or her back by, and you're given that much gold, as well as a non-droppable token (removed when loan shark is paid off or even killed) that would signal how much you owe.You'd be able to pay the loan shark back with gold or even trading valuable items to him. The token could even be used to determine how his goons act towards you when you talk to them. This would also have to be a time-based script. I was thinking this would be interesting for a module where you need a certain item to advance the story, but you can only get it by purchasing it, and you'd need to talk to the loan shark to acquire that money.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"970":{"Title":"Lobsters and Crabs","Author":"Hydromancerx","Submitted":20021125,"Updated":20021125,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"Have lobsters and crabs get added to the underwater tool set.","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"The Underwater tiles set is nice... but it has no creatures.

The problem with this method is that the player is required to be right next to the conversation owner in order to activate.

I suggest a lounge area with bar, games and such for players to collect into a good sized number and read the rules of the game. When the number of PCs is about right- a DM or permanent NPC could let them into the main playing area (say a castle). When they spawn in they would be given a note determining their identity, which is governed by either a permanent script or DM.The Rules of the Game: 1) Cannot reveal identity to anyone. 2) Every 'round' the lights of the castle/mansion/town etc would go pitch black for a period of time. This time would end say 15 seconds after a PC has been murdered. 3) Only PC's which have been given a murderer identity are able to kill anyone. 4) After the period of dark, when the victim has been discovered, all PCs gather in a lounge/town center etc to discuss where they were, who they think did it. 5) After a couple of minutes or so, it is time to vote. If done with a DM, the DM can collect votes by asking each player in turn who they think did it. 6) The PC with a vote majority dies/is out of the game and their identity is revealed. This process continues until there is only murderers alive or they have all been voted off. Questions or comments, drop me an email!

The player should be able to complete the module by killing/destroying everything in it. The player should also be able to complete the module by somehow persuading/threatening/scaring the leader(s) of this city into giving up their throne(s). This module should be aimed at level 20+ characters (because they have the most tools at their disposal). This module will probably be more unique in execution than in concept. Examples of methods to accomplish the module�s objective: --Sneaking into the palace and assassinating the leader(s) --Persuading the leader(s) to hand over the city peacefully -- Systematically killing the inhabitants of the city -- Scaring the leader(s) to hand over the city -- Poisoning the city�s water supply -- Inciting a revolution -- Spreading a plague -- Cause a destructive riot-- Burning the city down or causing its destruction through natural means (destructive druidic magic) -- Hire mercenaries to help destroy the city or to make you look more threatening (making the leaders more willing to give in and hand you the city) -- Summoning a Balor (or some other powerful chaotic evil creature) to destroy the town -- Lure a horde of powerful wildlife and/or monsters to the city or raise the dead in the city�s graveyard to kill/destroy the city -- Creatively killing the inhabitants of the city (poison, disease, magic, blowing up gathering places, etc..) There can (and probably should) be many more ways to accomplish the module�s objective; with force and without force (but keep in mind this module is aimed at evil characters). The character�s major RP motive in this module is either powerlust, bloodlust, or insanity. The city should be a fairly large, living, breathing city (think Grand Theft Auto games (not nearly as big tho)).","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1067":{"Title":"Module were you play a Vampire","Author":"Kalidra","Submitted":20030924,"Updated":20030924,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Id like to see a module were you play a vampire... and the module would take place in the old days...

I imagine it would be simple to create, as it'd basically be looking at one file, seeing if a line existed in the other, and if not, add the line, and move on. However, I am by no means a programmer. :O I thought that other, more prominent things might have a merge possibility (such as MS Word), though I thought I'd post this idea here and see what others have done to make this process easier. Even if Bioware simply adds the new stuff to the end of the old file, it still could get messed up if Bioware changed a function further up, added something in the middle of a vast web of functions somewhere else in the document, or removed a bad function altogether.

What if players could travel into subterrainean realms to battle drow elves, mind flayers and perhaps even beholders? It would of course probably require developing a few new tilesets to succesfully pull off.While I'm at it, I'm wondering if it would be possible for someone to implement a series of new heads for player characters (maybe about 40 to 50), also coupled with the possibilty of robes and cloaks (though robes would not be absolutely essential). Maybe remove the caps on the number of henchmen you could use and throw in a few new portraits and voicesets as well. Also, I wouldn't mind the possibility of enhancing my armor appearance, or adding some type of OnHit properties to my weapons. Lastly, it would be really cool if I could alter my character a bit each time I play a new game and perhaps even advance to level 30 or 40 (or sonething like that).

I think I've come up with a way it could be implemented in a sane manner, but I don't have the necessary skills to do it. My idea was to have a 'flat' tileset, with maybe a few dozen 'flat' tiles in it. The tileset comes with instructions for chopping up a large 'world map' texture into hunks suitable for use as tile skins, as well as instructions on how to install the texture hunks so they'll work with the flat tiles. By 'flat' tiles, I mean tiles that are just plain squares, no geometry on top... just a spot to put a hunk of the 'world map'. Remember that HAK someone had to put a map tile or something on the floor in one of the tilesets? This is similar, but more general... The 'flat' tileset has no groups, etc. In the toolset, you make an area using the 'flat' tileset that you've modified to include your world map texture hunks. Lay them out so it matches your world map.Next, put area transitions onto the parts of the world map that are 'alive'... in Baldur's Gate, for example, you'd have a transition over Candlekeep, etc. When a creature clicks the area transition, it's moved to the appropriate area. The map area's OnEnter/OnExit scripts can be used to calculate how much time it takes the creature to move between the locations and do something appropriate. So, we need: * 'flat' tileset with 16 (or 25 or 36 or 64...) different 'flat' tiles (I can't do this... HELP!) * documentation on how to assign power-of-two sized files (like 256x256) as textures to specific 'flat' tiles (I can write this up nicely if someone gives me the information) * documentation on how to chop up your world map so it'll fit into power-of-two sized textures (easy, I can write this) * demo module showing an overland map and suitable area transitions/time scripting (I can do this) * nicely packaged in a HAK (I can do this)","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1272":{"Title":"Override Chooser","Author":"Leo","Submitted":20031226,"Updated":20031226,"Category":"Applications","Short Description":"Being able to choose which custom files to choose","Type":"Additions","Description":"Well it occurs to me that with all the tons of custom content goodies being created( I'm especially referring to override and/maybe tlk's) it would be useful to have a small program that would ask you beforehand which world would you like to play on.

Another I would like to see is being the evil wizard. Everyone has seen a quest were you needed to 'kill the evil wizard/dark cleric to save the farm/city/princess/king/world/etc'.

One such plot might be some Old Ones from the official campaign escaping and taking over various worlds (like Krynn from Dragonlance or Faerun from Forgotten Realms). The Portalwalkers (sliders) would travel to each world and free them from the evil clutches of the old ones (each world would have its own set of villains working with and/or against said old ones). Then it's off to a new world, eventually trying to get home (which they probably never will do, unless a final module is created).This would probably take up a series of modules (one for each DND world like Krynn, Faerun, Ravenloft, maybe even other planes like Baator, Mt Celestia, and even Sigil).

It would have a lot of use for the more realistic servers if those predators in the wilderness areas actually at least stalked the prey animals rather than wandering aimlessly around. Ideally, They would have a script set that caused them to wander until they found an appropriate prey animal, then stalk it for a while, either kill it and begin eating it or it runs away, in which case they chase it for a while, then give up. Animals usually don't like having their kill stolen, so even animals that would usually be neutral will attack someone who attacks their prey. This would allow Builders to make the predators neutral unless you messed with them or their prey, allowing people who leave the wildlife alone to go by, and realistically causing random slaughter to endanger the PC.You would need to either set the predators to only stalk, and not attack the prey animals, or set it up so that prey animals spawn every once in a while, unless you want the area to get hunted out gradually (which could also be useful for plot purposes- 'Why have the wolves suddenly started killing more deer than any previous winter?').","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1384":{"Title":"Prefab Arena","Author":"anachrodragon","Submitted":20020916,"Updated":20020916,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"A prefab arena that can easily  droped into existing modules","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"I would like to see a prefab arena with the following: PCs can either watch fights between gladiatiors (with gambling) or join in fights against NPCs or other PCs.

If you had this Prefab world laid out before you all you would need to do is create the NPCs you may need extra for your story and maybe a special dungeon or area here and there.

Maybe you have instructions to get Vinny the Scumbag and Sons their 1000gp by thursday.A new quest can be generated after completing it or stumbling on another trigger. Clearly it would be inane and repetitive at first or even as several are completed but I think with enough of them and a well thought out system it can work. I think a good database can be developed of quest scripts can get very sophisticated over time.

You then apply racial and subracial ability modifiers. there are problems with rolling however, if you were to roll very low numbers they would be a great penalty on your character. so therefore if 3 or more dice are on or below 6, the player may choose to re-roll all the dice.Implementation: it would be obvious that a dialog system would be needed to be created so you can set the abilities the way you want. also there may be issues with subraces on some modules/pw's in which you may not know what the subrace ability modifiers are so it would be good to leave that somewhat open ended for modification. it would need to run on new characters only to make sure that characters with experience aren't modified. there may be some issues with people constantly creating new characters and then dumping them if they don't get the abilities they wanted (problem mainly for PW's). also it means that the ability point buy system in the character creation process would be overwritten, (create a wizard with 18 int (+4) but don't get any score near that.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1491":{"Title":"Roman City Tile","Author":"Roland the Rumbottle","Submitted":20030325,"Updated":20030325,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Roman houses and buildings.","Type":"Tilesets","Description":"I would like to see a reasonably accurate set of tiles to build a Roman type city.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1492":{"Title":"Roman Tile Set and Clothes","Author":"Roland","Submitted":20040117,"Updated":20040117,"Category":"Toolset","Short Description":"Roman Building and armor and weapon types","Type":"Tilesets","Description":"Roman Building and armor and weapon types","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1493":{"Title":"Roman Tileset","Author":"U2 Totally Rules","Submitted":20030901,"Updated":20030901,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"A Roman themed tileset with pillars, columns, pools etc.","Type":"Tilesets","Description":"My idea is basically this; a tileset modeled after an ancient Roman environment. Imagine how great this would be! Detailed columns of different varieties and designs, Roman houses, Roman baths and pools. This doesn't necessarily have to be confined to an anceint Roman module, I'm just suggesting a very Romanesque style of tileset. One of the main features of this tileset is that it would transcend the barriers between interior and exterior areas. As you know, a Roman house has many 'open' rooms. Rooms where you don't exactly have to walk through a door to get from outside to inside, but simply have to walk between a row of columns to get from grass to a tiled floor. There should be no area transition to get from inside to out, and there should be rooms where someone can stand and look outside and feel a breeze. I think that would be a revolutionary featureSuggestions that I have for this tileset include different varieties of floors, esp. detailed, decorated floor tiles, different varieties of decorated, richly engraved pillars and collumns, baths and pools, tables, and, if you are familar with them (you can certainly look them up), the different rooms and sections of a roman house. I think the main material, obviously, would be white marble. This is simply a suggestion. I know nothing about how to make tilesets, but if somebody with the proper skill and a good imagination got themselves together to make this happen, I think it could be great.

This gos the same for jackals.Hyena could be a dire wolf with a new head and reskinned. Ostrich would be a new model along with flamingo. Vultures could be redone hawks or eagles.

With that in mind I know it's possible that if you were to store a local variable onto the sequencer (with the spell's ID and casters current caster level) you should (in theory) pull this information during the casting phase and apply that when the sequencer is triggered. Anyhow just a hair brained idea if someone wants to do it before I have time to try it :)","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1553":{"Title":"Serpent people","Author":"unseen","Submitted":20030620,"Updated":20030620,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Serpent people, serpent warrior etc","Type":"Monsters","Description":"Serpent people, serpent warrior etc","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1554":{"Title":"Serpents AKA Yuan-Ti Halfbloods","Author":"Sebow","Submitted":20030717,"Updated":20030717,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"A Serpent Model Required...","Type":"Models","Description":"i would personally like to see serpents aka Yuan-Ti halfbloods in NWN, not only are they fearsome creatures that are also excellent guardians for the new ruin tileset that is in the SoU Expansion Pack.if you dont know what a Serpent is then i tell you, its an overgrown Snake, with arms... also their head is a bit different than the typical snake, a serpent looks a bit more like a reptile than the random snake.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1555":{"Title":"Server Population Lure","Author":"Shadowfaust","Submitted":20031103,"Updated":20031103,"Category":"Script","Short Description":"Make a server script to show more players then actually for a good reason.","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"Make a script that all servers can use, so that it shows a default population of 10/??, most people are encouraged to join servers becuase they see more players are actually there, meaning more people to team up with, make a default NPC bot system so that actual players 'seem' to be existing in close encounters, however they only say a few default conversations and then appear to run to another area or logout....This is good becuase more players will actually come in, when a TRUE server population of 10/?? is reached, after sequentially releasing 10 fake PC's, they are replaced by the real PCs, and vice versa, this is best used for Legacy servers or really late hours in the night, when people stubbornly won't play becuase of a low/none current server population.

I did not succeed since the toolset behaves a little bit strange when specifying a level 2 jump for a tile (a corner tile will work, a tile with a level 2 edge will not). Thallion took the time to show me that I might be able achieving this two level 2 jump by specifying level -1 for certain tile corners. But on the other hand that would lead to problems with shadows not being drawn below the 0 on the z axis. Now I thought of a different solution: I might just specify 3 different terrains: 'Grass level 0', 'Grass level 1' and 'Gras level 2'. A plain planar tile of these terrains would sit at height 0 m for Grass0, at 5m for Grass1 and at 10m for Grass2. And then I would make my tileset with a height transition of 15m. Building all the corners/transitions for these terrains as well as all height transition tiles, should allow me to to build something mountain-like.This works fine as you can see in the image. A slight problem with this approach is, that you need three tiles for each corner/transition type instead of just one. So this tileset now has 140 tiles. I did not want to do this by hand. So I did create some kind of 'terraforming' script for this tileset. I supply this as readme.

As part of his plan to take the keep, Haradak enlisted the aid of an assassin to deliver a potion to Tiviel that would turn her heart to Ice, then left a note indicating that the only cure was the Coalheart Crown.

Whispers are spreading through Gondor of a conspiracy, a group of men who follow someone, or something named 'Herumor' (who is my villain in the module.) The whole of what he wrote was essentially dialogue between an old man who can remember the reign of Elessar and understands evil, and a younger man who simply wants to know more, and attempts to infiltrate a 'club' meeting of Herumor's followers.As far as areas are concerned I've planned out (at least briefly) -Minas Tirith ->First level ->Second Level ->Seventh Level ->Rath Dinen Pelennor and surrounding country ->Pelennor gatelands ->Pelennor farmlands ->Ports at Harlond ->Mount Mindoluin At the outset these areas should be more than sufficient, although I eventually plan to include all of Gondor, Ithilien, The Pelargir, The Outskirts of Mordor.

A tileset, that has high towers, all kinds of realisitc buildings like the ones what were built hundreds of years ago. A tileset, what has rular and city shading into each other.This should give you a idea : http://nwn.bioware.com/_global/images/gallery/nwn_wallpaper_4/flapdesk_large.jpg .As you see on the picture, High towers (Guard and temples etc); Large bridges ; Dusty roads; Fancy gates and large walls. All they should be walkable. To get on and off and range or cast from the towers. There should be a way, taht i could walk to the rular area witout changing an area, so i could have logical ways. But it should stay natural, taht when i am on the tower ranging, i can see down adn mayby vica verca too. Also the old buildings should be right. Different kinds (wood, stone etc.), Castles and all the fun. The walls should be connectable with castle or houses or waht not. So a hack pack, where all the fun and enat stuff would be in. Also if there is time, there could be added those flying dragons etc...

If I had the time to learn how to script better or could match the lvl of craftsmanship of the original mod with what I do know I would, so I'm asking all you out there who do have the free time to work on a sequel for us to all relive that great multiplayer experience we had in the first module.I think the great thing about the module was that it wasn't too deep. It was just a good old fashioned adventure that everyone could enjoy (even my wife did and she usually calls me a nerd!) So I think another simple adventure somehow related to the ending of Vethboro Dragon would be really enjoyable. Perhaps the town could somehow be caught in the middle of 2 factions or maybe the dragon of Vethboro could request the aid of the adventures for some task...I don't know, if anyone is interested email me and I'd be happy to brainstorm with them via MSN or Yahoo.

How difficult would it be to add another property to the properties areas of an edited item.

You can't have bridges over any tile where PC's can walk beneath. So here�s a workar'nd idea. Curr, if I have a tile that is 3 high running in a N-S dir, surrounded by tiles that're 1 high, you have a �plateau.� If you have an impass wall, say the cliff face, and you wanted to let PC's pass through, there's a li'l blue wall they click on to teleprt them to the other side. This is used on river tiles; there's a dark hole that�s a clickable link to the other side of the forest area. MAIN IDEA: Can someone create INVISIBLE PLATEAU tiles with different bridges placed visibly atop them? The bottom area is invisible but solid. Thus, players on the bridge appear to be suspended in Mid-air, but are actually atop a Plateau! The bottom of these bridge tile areas is surrndd on all sides by automatic trans. From whtver side the bridge set is apprchd, the PC is telep�d to its opp side. NO PC walkunders!Rem the rules: 1) bridges aren�t act suspended in mid-air. They�re the only visible portion of an inv Plateau construct, allowing PC�s to see 'under� bridges. Bridges appear to hover above ground, but rest atop non visible terrain. 2) PC�s appr'ng the cliff face of a bridge are immed telep�d to other side of bridge. 3) All char�s should not be telep�d through such an area faster than others can run the same dist by ft. It should take just as long telep'ng through the area as if someone were outside run'ng beside me. For fairness sake. 4) You'd be able to see your enemy on the other side of the invisible Plateau construct, but you wouldn't be able to hit them with spells. Line of sight would still be in effect, negating all ability to attack by shooting spells or firing arrows 'under' the bridge. Not sure how this could be fixed, myself.

This reorganization would not be necessary for the top rated modules page, but the other module index is horribly out of date. Snowy adventure? Stone of recall???This reorganization would also make otherwise ignored modules more accessible to the general public. I recommend: categorizing modules by 1st level only, Low levels(2-6), medium levels(7-13), high levels(14-20), and Epic(20+).

For example, someone should make a system for company management. Players could work for existing companies doing jobs such as running errands, shopkeeping, stocking shelves or just janitorial duties. Doing such will give them 'Job Experience' which can be recorded via database and used to improve the players standing in the company or allow them to start out at a higher position when joining a new company. Annother possability is for the player to become manager of a company or even start their own company in which case they would have to hire PC's or NPC's to work for them. NPC's would be more reliable but would also cost more then the PC's would.There could be a punch clock system so there would be no confusion when the time comes to give out the paychecks and NPC's would be handled automatically. When it comes to stores, there would have to be a certian degree of NPC shopping where random NPC's would drop by the store and buy things from the player who is the active salesman at the time. The player would have to use his Charisma to try getting the customer to buy more expencive items. the Business run by players would also have to worry about buying the goods and supplies as well as paying for maintenance of the building. Perhaps a stock market could also be added where players who have bank accounts (or large sums of money) could buy and sell shares of a company or even invest in materials such as gold or maybe diamond mining.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1950":{"Title":"car models","Author":"Capt.

If my thinking is correct, it should be possible to use the CopyObject() bug to log and copy all a PC's items into a placeable's inventory, then delete all the items which have been copied, leaving only the duplicated items. These could then be compared against the selected object to determine if the object was in the container.

This inspired me with the idea that a castle-interior doesn't necessarily have to be an interior. Imagine, if you will, a seamless transition between the outside world and a castle courtyard, cut off from the outside by walls with pillars connected to it, torches lining the walls...well, I hope you get the picture. Now no doubt combining the forest/rural/castle interior tilesets wouldn't be hard at all with all the other strange combos, including caves being combined with outdoor areas, and it would be enough to make a what I have in mind...however I would like to place another challenge into this idea.What if these castle interior walls were combined with the city walls somehow, so one side appeared like castle interior and the ouside piece (assuming it doesn't have another interior piece behind it) would be a high wall with a walkable surface on top of it. As well, the bottoms of all these tiles would have to be made as two or three versions, one to fit seamlessly with the rural/forest ground tiles and others to fit seamlessly with the castle interior ground tiles. So, while a combination of those three tilesets alone would be enough, or even just forest/castle interior without the rural part. meeting the challenge would be like recreating the models that make up all those tilesets and making them into one big tileset.

Psions are divided into six subclasses, each focusing on one of the psionic disciplines. An important item to psion's would be psicrystals, a psion's equivalent of a familiar. They are basically sentient crystals that gain powers as the psion gains levels. These crystals are reflections of different parts of a Psion's personality, thus they have a sort of intelligence. They also gain abilities the Psion cannot ever gain, because a Psion has the limits of a humanoid brain. The psychic warrior is the equivalent of the bard or ranger, more balanced between psionic and martial talents. They gain bonus feats which help to apply their psychic abilities to combat. Psions and Psychic Warriors have weapons and equipment that suits their power and nature: crystals, vivid colors, and radiating energy.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2098":{"Title":"Strahds machine","Author":"kefrem","Submitted":20040501,"Updated":20040501,"Category":"Toolset","Short Description":"Strahd's machine from the moduel I10","Type":"Items","Description":"anyone thought of making this beauty as a placeable?","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2099":{"Title":"sci fi fantasy","Author":"Erikj","Submitted":20040501,"Updated":20040501,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Buck Rodgers/space","Type":"Additions","Description":"I would like to know is there anything out there that resembles the old ssi buck rodgers rpg and if not is there any possibilities that it could be made?

Clear? The only thing that is going on here is that I spent yesterday going through several hundred descriptions of tileset-related hakpacks and I noticed some gaps that would be nice to see filled. So any tileset guys out there, here goes: There have been very few addons made for some of the default tilesets. Surely someone, somewhere must have an idea on how to enrich those tilesets. Please note that I am not talking about reskins here, but rather new tiles or tile groups that would fit into those sets: Crypt: One addon adds diagonal walls. I have suggested rounded corners before, but that seems to be about it.Dungeon: If there are any addons made specifically for the Dungeon tileset, I have missed them. Frozen wastes: How about one or two Igloo tiles, or perhaps they should be implemented as placeables instead? Even better, how about an Ice castle, looking like a giant sculpture? Ruins: It would be easy to add the airships to the Ruins (those gnomes fly everywhere) and Lord Sullivan's 'Tombs and Ruins' should fit nicely into this tileset (a must for those that want to code the secret room in the buried pyramid of the lost city of the nameless king or something like that). How about something like a ruined version of GrassMaster's Roman Temple, for example? Underdark: It would be really neat to add more water-related tiles to the Underdark set: waterfalls, streams, ponds and lakes.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2115":{"Title":"Tileset ideas (part 2)","Author":"Adinos","Submitted":20040509,"Updated":20040509,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"More tileset suggestions","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"2) Gothic interior, for any Ravenloft-like modules - preferably something more than just a simple reskin of the City/Castle Interior sets. A proper cathedral interior would be nice - and yes, a tile group adding a Gothic cathedral to the City Exterior set would be really neat. 3) Fairyland Forest - the place where fairies fly around, and unicorns drink from ponds. Needs flowering trees and shrubs, as well as flowers - lots of those. A small stream flowing between the trees into a small pond would make this perfect. Suitable buildings for something like this might look like they were made of crystal. 4) Volcanoes. We have lava streams, but I how about adding them and an erupting volcano to one of the mountain tilesets? Combined with proper sounds, and a dark sky with lightning flashing overhead, (like the one in the Nanosky package) it should be able to produce a very believable environment.5) Plane of elemental fire. We have one tileset like that, but it is basically just a reskin - there is a bit more needed - more fiery eruptions from the ground, and bigger flames. I also have a few smaller suggestions: 6) Saunas. Any Finnish tileset people out there? It would be neat to have a sauna addon, complete with sittable benches. 7) Roads without (wheel) tracks. Some cultures never invented the wheel, but had roads. It just does not make sense for their roads to have tracks obviously left by wheels. 8) A few more buildings, including an amphitheater, some aquaducta and Norwegian-style stave churches? 9) White cliffs of Dover?

In addition to some tileset retexturing in order to make a believable geologically active area, some placeables would be needed, at least to get a decent animations of a geyser eruption.

Better yet, add some broken versions of the existing bridges. 'oops... you have to make a detour'. 13) *Large* mountain wall doors - 'Mines of Moria'-style. Perhaps more suitable as a placeable, though. 14) Diagonal streets and roads as addons for city, rural and rural winter tilesets ? 15) Deep rivers (that you cannot wade across) for Rural tileset, perhaps combined with some Lake tiles? 16) Narrow passages for the various interior tilesets - city, castle, caves/mines, dungeon and crypt.

It seems like everything D&D related has you as an adventurer or something like it. I think it would be interesting to have a module where you start out as a conscripted infantry grunt in a large army going to war. It would be a single-player module where you start out at your home base, rumors flying about of a war about to break out with a neighboring country, then you're sent on ships to invade the country. I was thinking something more roleplay-based, with extensive character developement with your fellow soldiers. For the first two hours or so of gameplay you would be with the soldiers, and after a few battles you would rise through the ranks and become an officer. At that point it would be similar to Dreamcatcher 4 - Evermeet, at the part where you're leading the 6 elves through Evermeet.After the first few hours is where, during a suprise attack you are captured by the enemy and brought to their capital. En-route you escape and find yourself behind enemy lines. At this point it resumes like most modules, you're in enemy territory but you have quests and stuff. I have this whole thing written out, it's pretty interesting. If anybody would like to help me create this module, email me. It would require somebody who is good at scripting, as I am horrible at it and I would be unable to make something like this on my own. In RL I'm an infantryman in the US Army so I have a lot of experience in the subject matter and have a lot of knowledge about what it is like to be a grunt.

Anybody bitten by a zombie is doomed to become one, but some people are strangely immune to the zombie disease, yourself being one of them. But that doesn't mean they aren't dangerous. Each zombie would be a level above you, making a one-on-one with a zombie a mostly-even match. This is intended as a horror module. For the first couple hours of gameplay, you are trapped on your home continent filled with zombies. Gathering what survivors you can, you must outrun and outsmart the zombies any way you can to get off the continent and sail east, where there may be a way to stop this, or maybe just an uninfected island.I started working on this several months ago, but I didn't get far because of school and I'm just awful with scripting. I had a whole storyline sketched out with plenty of variety for a totally unique play experience, mostly puzzles and RP (yes a zombie module with very little hack & slash!) but I didn't have the time to finish it. If anybody would like to fool around with this idea, please contact me and I will give you every idea I had and I'll send you my unfinished module for you to do what you wish with. Once again, this is intended to be a single-player module focused on role-playing and puzzle scenarios, as in finding ways to escape the zombies, and eventually escaping from the continent for a completely different type of adventure to stop the curse once and for all.

If a PC is seen with a jail badge by a guard, they will be killed by a guard(and suffer the penalties of being killed...in which case they will lose their JAIL badge)","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2181":{"Title":"Dinosaur  Pack","Author":"LordVon","Submitted":20040617,"Updated":20040617,"Category":"Toolset","Short Description":"Dinosaurs","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"All Dinsos thanks and some big jungles tilesets thats all","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2182":{"Title":"Great Kilt and other ideas","Author":"Sean","Submitted":20040618,"Updated":20040618,"Category":"Toolset","Short Description":"Scottish belted plaid and other ideas","Type":"Suggestions","Description":"I'd like to request from the great, wonderful, magical, and talented (too thick?) creators of marvelous haks to create or add to the formal kilt the baggier upperportion for a great kilt (i.e. Rob Roy).

What I'm thinking is 90% of the enemies would be human, some animals like tigers and such but mostly human and most of the dialouge is dubbed and badly with the weird pausing in their lines and all. It would use a filter to give that scratchy effect and the music would be alittle worn in certain places (like the sound a tape makes when you watch it too much) and the fighting sound effects would be changed (with a few voice sets) so when you hit you get that 'Spcht!' sound. Another idea I had was to put in special techniques via items so if you learn under a certain master you gain a technique from his school. The only reason I type this here instead of making the module myself is that I'm not too great with making modules or editing the game but I do have some 'voice' schooling and so I could do (most of) the voices but not the scripting.

Let me elaborate. Piece one is an armor chest, but it has been modelled as just the armor, no parts of the body have been modelled. It is designed so that it could even be a part of possessed armor, you know, without the body and stuff? if you put this on top of the jumpsuit, you will have a piece of armor worn over the body. The same goes with part 2, the forearms, they can be made so as not to totally cover the forearm, and be slightly larger so they dont clip into the body mesh.This goes goes for 4 and 5, pelvis and shin respectively. 3 and 6, the hands and feet are modelled as normal. All the other armor parts are modelled as the ones labelled. Slightly larger so as not to clip, and not entirely covering the bodymesh, so as to show bending elbows and knees and the like. The bodymesh can come in many different variations. It could be chain, leather, cloth, scale, whatever the modeller chooses, then they can add armor parts over it to make a realistic model, unlike the wooden puppet models we see running around in NWN today.

Ideally, such a function would slow the whole game, so that it could be safely used in combat (bullet time anyone?), but I would settle for a script which just slowed the players move rate temporarily, of course as DM I would then have to be careful when it is used, but it would be good enough.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2275":{"Title":"Naval Battles","Author":"Allyndn_the_Beggar","Submitted":20040807,"Updated":20040807,"Category":"Script","Short Description":"You know, like with pirates and stuff...","Type":"Systems","Description":"We all saw Pirates of the Carribean...

There would have to be something adapting the siege weapon tools to man cannons. Something with using ships as creatures to simulate movement (Heed's ship demo?), ship decks for close fighting, and a way to make all of this work together. A ship to ship encounter should begin at a distance (cf ArcaneSpace), close to ranged (cf that scene in Dreamcatcher), then go hand to hand (Ship Decks). And do this as seemlessly as possible.

It is quite difficult to find and use these. As most of you know, these placables have the added benefit of allow mod builders to significantly reduce HAK size, because in-game textures are used. What we have now is basically a mish-mash of things that were pulled on an as-needed basis by various *kind* people (props to Johan_Hanson, Danmar, Schazzwozzer, Volition, and many others). It seems logical to me that there should be an effort to integrate and complete the collection of existing placables extracted from the Bioware tilesets.SO if some kind people out there with the necessary skills could compile a definitive 'Bioware tileset placable' HAK, I think everyone would agree that it would be HUGELY useful. Step one is gathering, cataloging and organizing the files already available on the vault. (This step alone would be extremely beneficial to the community.) Step two would be going through the tilesets and extracting the remaining placables, which would in some cases also involve getting or creating walkmeshes. It's a large project, but this would be the logical completion of the efforts of both Bioware and the other community people who have already extracted selected placables. Bioware did some of this, but primarily focussed on other things knowing that the community could get the remaining placables if it decided to do so.

Even if the glow was removed, they could still tell fairly easily from the character's appearance. So, the spell invisibility should apply this visual effect:Change the character model to a genderless, hairless model with a cloudy, nondescript texture. Also, if it's possible, which I doubt it is, change the glow on invisible people to a pure white, and hide their names.

I was running around in the original and I noticed that the windows really added to the atmosphere. I'll try to explain this the best way I can: The window, of course, is large and see through. You are able to see things moving 'outside' through the window. Lighting, like lightning,effects the 'inside' as well as 'outside' by lighting areas of the inside as well. (The portion of the outside you can see through the window.)I thought this might be possible as a seperate tile that cannot be accessed--a tile only for the window. That way, you can put placeables in the tile, such as trees and lighting effects and be able to see them through the window. This seperate tile idea was spawned from looking through the Dwarven tileset and seeing how the gothic window was done for one of the entrances. If the window was 'see through' it would give more of a feel that there is more then just then interior. This might even be connected to the exterior tileset somehow through scripting. Or, I was thinking as a placeable. Lisa's mirrors are perfect examples. This would only be useful for an interior tileset that has no access to the outside without switching areas, but it would still give the feeling that there is an 'outside'.

This would be perfect for creating overland maps similar to what Baldur's Gate had.Demangel has used this approach in his Dragon Riding System, but he used mini-trees, rocks for mountains etc. This is pretty cpu intensive, so he would probably like to see these mini placeables also. I think ideally an overland system would need miniature mountains 1x1, 1x2, 1x4 etc. forests 1x1 , 1,2, 4x4 etc., mini castle, town, city, ruins, icons, swamps, black line placeables for roads, and so on.

All you have to do, is change the the way the DD levels up. ie, When you would normally get the Dragon Breath ability normally, you instead get to choose from the different colored dragons as a feat choice. Also, when you would gain wings, it would check to see which breath weapon you chose, then give you the appropriate wings. This can also apply to when you get immunity to an element, such as the Blue Dragon being immune to electrity (don't hold me to that, I'm guessing)If anyone would like to make the class via this way, it would definately expand the DD's flexiblilty. Though, you might want to play around with it a bit, as in making all black dragon disciples have to be neutral or evil or something like that.

If instead, their charactors began to deteriorate after a certian prime age - say 35 playing hours - eventually declining to lethal levels depending upon their attained level - then the game play should be more fascinating and challenging. Imagine this, if your charactor peaked out at around 35 playing hours from a combination of natural increase and earned experience plus developed skill and strength - you would still have to continue developing in order to maintain that level.

In the course of working with more advanced scripters, I discovered that I am using the weenie Module Event System in my Gem System.\n\nAfter looking over the X2 system, I agree with this estimation, but about half the advanced scripters I meet seem to automatically assume that anyone who is too much of a newbie to already know how to use it should not go anywhere near the X2 system, and the other half are busy with a dozen projects and don't have time to write a tutorial.\n\nSo, I hereby request one- I think we could really use a nice clean tutorial on how the hell the X2 Module Events system works, as it is not mentioned in the Lexicon or in any tutorials on the Vault that I've been able to find, and Lilac Soul, in the docs for Script Generator, the world's most popular newbie scripting tool, is actively pushing newbies away from learning how to use the X2 system. I know that seems like a kindness, but making us afraid of the current system and pushing us to hold with an older one isn't going to help us become respectable scripters in our own right, and will make our creations harder to incorporate into new modules.\n\nI suspect I'm going to get flamed for saying Lilac Soul is anything less than Deific, but I am not trying to be mean about it- I still use Script Generator to figure out the basic structure of script types I haven't messed with before, and I am definitely glad to see the update. I just didn't like the feeling of making a system I thought was fully up-to-date and was very proud of, only to discover that the Event files I thought were Community Standard have been out of date for a couple of years.

Already designed, requires scripter influence though.","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"Greetings,\n\nIm posting here in the hopes that someone will be up to the challenge. Someone was kindly scripting this system for me, but has suddenly disapeared off the earth and caused the entire release of my module to be put on hold...\n\nBasically, the system is based around the Channeling features that exist within the Wheel of Time. I have planned it all out (somewhat in my mind atm) and can give a detailed map of what the system will do, and how it will work. For any scripters out there who have experience with the Wheel of Time, I think you might be able to relate on what its about more.\n\nThe system comprises of 4 main features:\n\nEmbracing/Seizing the Source - Channelers will need to embrace/seize the Source in order to be able to cast any spells. However, if they stay embraced for too long, then they begin to weaken slightly... if they stay embraced for far too long then they risk becoming addicted to the Source and eventually burning themselves out.\n\nLinking - Channeler (women) are able to form links with other channelers and pool their power together but sdacrificing their own control over their power at the same time. The person in charge of the circle (circle of linked channelers) is granted huge amounts of Power to control... thus is able to make much more powerful spells. These will either be in the form of some custom onactivate unique items which will create powerful spells or another work around at the suggestion of the scripter. This is perhaps going to be the most complicated part of the system.\n\nBonding - Channelers are able to bond Warders, which act as their bodyguards and protectors. Warders and Channeler alike recieve bonuses to their awareness and can rely on each other for strength. Relatively simple facet of the system to script.\n\nThe Taint - Male channelers must suffer due to the Taint on their side of the Source. When ever they seize the source, they make a madness check to their madness value (something that will increase and stay permanantly to a channeler as they lvl etc). Different effects will happen depending on how much they fail against their madness value. Such as sickness, exhaustion, loss of attribute points, and they become much more extreme as the channeler may lose control of the Power... lashing out at everything around him, or even trying to kill himself. This is perhaps a bit more challenging to a scripter... depending on what sicknesses we will incorporate and which are possible to.\n\nSo.. there you have it... my channeleing system for the WoT layed out for any scripter to tackle. If you want to know more about it please dont hesitate to message me, email me (benenam@gmail.com) or pop by our forums at http://invicta-universe.com/tworiversforum .Idealy I would love to work along side the scripter and discuss the system thoroughly with them... this is really a last ditch plea for help as without it, Ill have to abandon this system which will definately lower accuracy to the WoT for my module.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2591":{"Title":"Martial arts class","Author":"Masato","Submitted":20050617,"Updated":20050618,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"Perhaps for the next prc update?","Type":"Additions","Description":"I'm kindove sick of being a monk all the time just to use a \"martial arts\" character, and the fact that you have to be lawfull.

Mechanical implementation of sub-races hasn't been a very important issue, its often looked at as of secondary importance- so my suggestion can be looked at in that way! If you've implemented any of these ideas I'd love to know how.\n\nGoal: Implement sub-race stats with permanent stat alterations. There are three different ways to do this as far as I can tell. During Race.2da, DM Client, and .Bic Editor.\n\nFirst Attempt: Races.2da- You can implement a custom race in Races.2da, which basically possesses all the necessary stat alterations.\nImplementation: Basically, there are only 6 selectable races/buttons in standard NWN Character creation. Which means that, you can't have one of those buttons reference a different race (subrace) in the Races.2da . Fortunately, you don't need the NWN character creator to create a character (.bic)- you can create a .bic with a third party program. So, its possible to implement an HTML questionnaire style webpage that takes in variables and information and outputs a .bic into the necessary player folder of the server. This is pretty straightforward, CODI created a character creator that can be integrated directly into a web-server in a much similar fashion.\nDownsides: It's quite a bit of webcode- but a lot of it has already been done, and a simple version would be pretty easy to do.\n\nsecond attempt: DM Client, you can dynamically adjust racial stats with DM functions.\nImplementation: Setup a non-user DM Client to respond to player login, and automatically apply sub-racial states dynamically. This probably requires a third-party DM Client to likely be controlled by MySql that responds to sub-race player entry. IMO This method is the neatest because you can use it to implement elixir style potions that permanently alter stats and fun stuff like that.\nDownsides: It could get complicated. Or not as much as I think- is there an easy way to reference DM console commands without actively using a DM client?\n\nThird attempt: .BIC editor activated by client exit- basically, when a person logs on with a new character, the server can kick them and execute a .bic editor (using sql or x or something) with specific instructions to alter stats. Pretty straightforward.\ndownside: Implementation for the end-user is 'rigid' non flowing. Code would prolly be easier than the others.\n\n\nI prefer the DM-Client option because it provides the mod-dev with the option of dynamic racial alterations- which is fun :) . And, there are other potentially great uses for a DM-Client that doesn't require a user.\n\nI would do it myself, but I don't have a lot of experience with third-party programs and server relations. Any explanations/guidance would be great!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2598":{"Title":"CNR Script Templates for non-scripters","Author":"Scimuse - Whoever gets it done","Submitted":20050626,"Updated":20050627,"Category":"Script","Short Description":"templates of user defined CNR recipes, devices etc... for non scripters","Type":"Additions","Description":"I am not a scripter.

I know that PCs, like NPCs, have \"hides\" that can be interacted with dynamicaly and I was wondering how many actions can allow you to fire off a script. This is what I'm trying to accomplish; Say a PC or NPC successfully sets up a trap, I would like to have a script that gives the player 1 point in his set trap skill %5 of the time or some small percentage like that or perhaps a player makes his Listen check and a script fires off a 1 point award for Listen 5% of the time or so. I know that a classless system will mess with spellcasters, but I think it'll be better to use Spellcraft to determine magical proficiency and even better, make arcane spells COLLECTIBLE again instead of selectable, as they should be. Players would need to research, be taught or buy spell copies. I could make the spell icon be a plot item of 0 weight in their inventory.

This system is designed to facilitate RP of character disguises without the use of helmets and appearance changes. This system is not designed for infiltration of hostile NPCs or anything of that nature.\n\nSystem Premise: The PC attempting to disguise their self uses a limited use (3) Disguise Kit* with a Unique Power.\n \n\n* Description: Disguise Kit +1 (+3, +6, +10); this small bundle contains pigments, base colors, detail pencils, accessories and a touch of magic that allow you to disguise yourself for 1d3+3 game hours. Each kit has enough for three uses. Tag: ms_disguisekit1, etc.\n\nThe kits are used and an alteration or add-on to the default perception script causes automatic rolls to occur whenever the Disguised PC meets another PC. The text is displayed in the combat window of the PCs encountered by the Disguised. The disguised will not know if their disguise is working or failing until the PCs react.\n \nSystem Mechanics: The script will build a DC based on the PC�s Bluff skill and what equipment they are wearing. Modifiers are as follows:\n \nModifier Condition\n=====================================================================\n+2 Any helmet\n+5 Disguise Mask*\n+2 Any common garb\n+ ring mod Disguise Ring (+1, +2, +3)**\n+ kit mod Disguise Kit (+1, +3, +6, +10)\n \n * Description: Disguise Mask; this mask resembles the head of another humanoid all together. It is designed to act like a latex mask of the modern era but magically align themselves to the wearer. They come in many skin tones and hair colors. Tag: ms_disguisemask (all will be the same)\n ** Description: Disguise Ring; these magical rings cause a physical distortion of the wearer�s facial features. The magic of these rings does not work with any head gear. Tag: ms_disguisering1, etc.\n\nOnce the DC is gotten it will be stored on the Disguised PC as a variable.\n \nThe perception script then fires for each PC that perceives the Disguised PC and determines their level of perception based on a Spot Check.\n \n\n Roll Perception Response\n=====================================================================\n< DC �[FULLNAME] is disguised and you believe them.�\n> DC �[FULLNAME] is disguised and you don�t recognize them\n but are unsure who it really is.�\n> DC +5 �[FULLNAME] is disguised and you know who it really is.�\n\n\nAt this point it goes to straight RP based on the information provided. Mind you, the PC who observes the Disguised PC can choose to ignore the discovery and go along with the Disguised. They should not ignore a belief in the disguise.\n\n\nWe would like to thank Velkyn for spending the time on creating this system.

I think it could maybe spark more ideas within thier modules. For example DMs could simulate far journeys from Neverwinter all the way to the Great Gray Lands of Thar to the northeast.Even adding major cities such as Shadowdale to pass through on the way and maybe arrange an encounter with Elminstar to add a quest that sends them even further out of the way of thier pre stated quest into the northern lands. Some party members meeting Elminster would stir some party members to wonder what items and exp they could acquire by completing his tasks or even by deafeating the wizard himself or attempting to anyways.

And a classic which I've always been fond of is a bright, clear meadow, full of plain, perhaps slightly tall, grass extending in all directions and tucking under the horizon. And in the center of it all, a grand massive tree, its branches forming a canopy that stretches gravity-defiantly far from the trunk. A perfect example of this that comes to mind is in the n64 game \"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask\" where you enter the moon. The tree with all the kids with masks running around it. Unfortunately I couldn't find a picture (I will keep looking, of course). Basically the only thing needed for such an area would be the tree to place in the center. Of course, it's no small undertaking, considering the size and issues that may present themselves when attempting to make foliage one can walk under. But I think it is an undertaking full of possibilities for stories, one could even place a door or trapdoor in it. (for all intents and purposes I'd rather have the tree door-less for my request.)\nSimply, once the tree is in place it's just a matter of placing it in a large area, clearing it so it's entirely grass aside from the tree placeable, and then placing a ring of triggers a ways out around the tree that send one to the waypoint/starting point/other area, so if one ventures away from the tree they're sent back to where they started, or moved to another area, etc.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, though. Imagine walking through a doorway and being transported to the middle of a field, the door from which you came nowhere to be found (or perhaps right behind you, unbound to a wall, but again, that's another request entirely.)\n\nThis description has been rather long-winded, but I think I've thoroughly made my point. If someone could make this tree placable I would be most appreciative, as well as many in the community, I'm sure.\n\nThanks for listening!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2657":{"Title":"Neverwinter PW Tilset Pack","Author":"Stille Vande","Submitted":20050917,"Updated":20050917,"Category":"Expansion","Short Description":"A tileset pak with the concept of standardizing PW's","Type":"Tilesets","Description":"I myself personally, I like playing on PW's. The only bad thing is that you usually have to download huge haks for each different PW, which only works for that particular world. Now that CEP is released, the only thing thats making the downloads for each PW so large is that there is no standardized tileset pak, combining the best of all that is on NWVault. If there is one that is made, then the haks for each specific world will be much smaller, which will save developers from getting headaches from trying to create such a tileset, and also save space on each players hard drive.\n\nI am right now incorporating a hak system that is CEP compatible (in fact, youll need CEP, SoU, and HoTU to use it). Its looking like it will contain aroun 45-50 tilesets, and be about 280-300M in rar format. I am also making it so that later on, when more tilesets are out that should be added to the hak system, I can release new \"releases\", which you can download almost like a patch.... there will be no need to make developers and players download a different hak system, thereby destroying what they have already created with release 1 on this system.\n\nIt will be ready for beta testing in about 2 weeks, which should not last very long at all, considering the attention to detail Im taking with this project. \n\nTogether with this hak system and CEP, like will be easier for developers and players alike.\n\nNOTE: At this moment, I don't have the list of tilesets Ive already incorporated into it so far (Im about 75% done, and its already 230M rarred), but I will update this when I get the chance.

The same system could be applied to NWN quite easily.\n\nIt'd work like this:\n\nThe Mod Manager program sit's in it's folder, and knows where the NWN override folder is. The Mod Manager folder then has it's own sub folder to contain override \"mods\" - so you'd have like.\n\n/Mod Manager/\n/Mod Manager/Kenku/\n/Mod Manager/Fluffy Purple Dragon/\n\nThe mod folders themselves contain the files required by the override, for example textures, models, sounds, whatever *NOT* .2da's however.\n\nEach mod folder then has an XML or similar script file inside, which uses a simple script system to modify/parse to text based files, as well as some basic cover info like name of the mod, description, author etc. \n\nThe software front end then reads all the mod folders, and presents a list of them, and the user can then decide which to activate/deactivate. The program then copies the required files from the mod folder, to the override directory, and runs the XML file, and modifys appropriate .2da's I suppose it'd look something like:\n\n/armour mod/pmh0_chest115.mdl\n/armour mod/pmh0_chest115.plt\n\n// Inside the XML file\n[addline file=\"parts_chest.2da\" mode=\"replace\" line=\"115\"]\n115 **** 8.01\n[/add]\n\nThe advantage of this system is many overrides that are normal incompatible could be activated/deactivated and work together seamlessly for the most part, and a quick error check to see if the XML is trying to edit the same lines would eradicate incompatibility issues.\n\nOther functionality could include appending additional 2da lines on demand if the required 2da number is higher than the existing .2da actually contains (ie. armour part 230 when there's only 90 lines present).\n\nFringe benefits include making comaptibility haks wayyy easier, since you can combine the contents of several overrides, scoop out the contents of the override folder and dump it into a hakpack.\n\nTo be honest I have no idea why this has never been done, but here's my two cents. It's a shame I can't program or I'd have done this myself long ago =(","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2659":{"Title":"NPC heads available to PC's","Author":"RIQ","Submitted":20050917,"Updated":20050917,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"NPC Heads available to PC's/ New heads based on or similar to NPC heads.","Type":"Models","Description":"I suppose this entry is mainly targeted towards Lisa and any other person that have made headmodels.\n\nI was wondering if it would be possible to make NPC heads available to PC's.

Is creating this Mime class possible?","Type":"Request to be created","Forums":"Link","Description":"My experience with the Toolset is nil, so forgive me if the following idea is impossible to manufacture. \n\nAfter flexing my brain for a few minutes, my mind began to wander. I started thinking about that old Playstation game \"Final Fantasy Tactics\". And then I thought, \"Wouldn't it be neat to convert some of those jobs/classes to DnD classes?\" \n\nOne of the classes that I think would be very unique (=fun) is the Mime class. I just thought of this now, so I would love it if everyone could add their two cents to this and build upon the idea (or criticize it). \n\nThe Mime, essentially, witnesses a used ability (spell, feat, possibly item ability) and then mimics that ability (i.e.: uses that ability herself, as if she already had access to it). \n\nFor example: \n\nAlarala, a mime, meets up with Okin (rogue), Ardnalac (sorcerer), and Nartsirt (cleric/psionicist) to go hunt some bandits. On the way, they come across an elite minotaur! They would never survive that fight, and so Ardnalac casts invisibility on herself, Okin and Nartsirt. Unfortunately, she can't cast another invisibility spell. Having watched the spell being cast, though, Alarala mimics the casting and casts invisibility upon herself. They bypass the minotaur without any problems. \nThey reach the bandits' fort and slowly approach the gates. They are met with several bandits waving their rapiers menacingly. Ardnalac sends out a few magic missiles into the first of the bandits, dropping him to the ground. Okin hides in the shadows and then delivers a crippling backstab attack. Alarala watches with interest. Ardnalac is beset by several bandits and is bleeding profusely. Nartsirt rushes over and heals her wounds with some clerical spell. Alarala, still standing back, watches this, too. \nSuddenly, archers appear on an unreachable platform and begin firing down at the party. Nartsirt makes a quick decision and opens a dimension door and steps through, appearing beside the archers. He makes quick work of all but two of the archers, and is knocked to the ground, unconsious and bleeding. \nAlarala frowns and takes action. She runs behind a nearby boulder (convenient, eh?) and casts invisibility on herself. She steps out from behind the boulder and opens a dimension door to the platform and steps through, appearing beside the two remaining archers, who are about to kill Nartsirt. She backstabs one archer, dropping him to the ground. The other archer turns around in surprise, only to be met with magic missiles erupting from Alarala's hands. Alarala kneels down next to Nartsirt and reworks the healing spell she had seen him cast earlier. \nIn the meantime, Okin and Ardnalac have finished off the bandits on the ground. Alarala and Nartsirt recover and soon join the rest of the party. They decide that it's time to return to Mirtho for some much needed r&r. \n\nOkay, I got a bit carried away, but I think that little story demonstrates the class's potential. As for actual game mechanics... \n\n1) After resting (or a 12- or 24-gamehour period) Alarala would \"forget\" the abilities she acquired. \n\n2) As for how the mime would acquire the abilities for use...perhaps they could be drawn from the system chat (i.e.: Ardnalac casting Invisibility, Okin backstabs, Nartsirt uses Psionic: Dimension Door, X casts Y, X uses Y, etc.). \n\n3) The possibility to mimic creature abilities would be prooty hot, like auras, or gazes, or breath attacks depending on the level of the Mime (i.e.: couldn't mimic dragon breath until epic level mime). \n\n4) I can't think of any Mime-specific feats...though maybe that's how copying abilities would work. How do Changelings copy shape? Possibly something similar? You could select the player/creature with the feat and it will copy the last ability they used for a short time?\n\n-Sceluscio","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2668":{"Title":"NWN Chipwits!","Author":"bloodsong","Submitted":20050928,"Updated":20051002,"Category":"Script","Short Description":"Chipwits was an old C=64 educational/game that taught the basics of programming using cute little robots that loved coffee and pie.  You had to build circuit boards by filling them with basic programming commands (if/then, goto/return, look/listen, etc),","Type":"Other","Description":" I LOVE Chipwits, but the game seems to have vanished from the face of the Earth. so then i thought, what if you could get -oh, say a codi monodrone- and fill its inventory 'boards' with command-items? then you could have nwn-wits! players could program the little cuties and set them loose in a maze and see how well they do. and get xp! (and, hey, maybe learn something about nwn scripting syntax!)\n\n well, it's not exactly a fantasy theme, but it is an interesting puzzle for the said monodrones, or golems or such. and lord knows, nwn can use more non-hack-n-slash xp projects.\n\n now, the problem is, you can't really arrange a creature's inventory and read it (script-wise) in a logical manner. so probably it would have to be done with placeables on a checkerboard grid. once the components are placed, a switch could be thrown to generate an item that would contain the scripting as shown on the workboard, that could then be given to the creature to 'program' it.\n\n the components worked like this: each operand took up one grid space on the board. and each had one or two output nodes, that pointed to adjacent squares on the board. each board was labelled A, B, C, etc.\n so you could place command components like this:\n EYE (look, this activated the chipwit's visual sensors)\n OCTOPOD ('if' you see an octopod)\n-yes node- SHOOT (blast it)\n-no node- FWD (move forward)\n\n commands were LOOK (see directly ahead, no limit), FEEL (touch one square ahead.. or behind or to the sides i think you could tell it), SMELL (used for attempting to track coffee and pie), LISTEN (to hear octopods). TAKE/EAT (grab whatever was one square ahead and eat it).\n FORWARD, BACK, TURN LEFT, TURN RIGHT. (movement, obviously. turning was done in 45 degree increments.)\n objects were COFFEE, PIE, OILCAN, DISK (things the chipwit could get/eat and continue to function. if it didnt get enough of these, it ran out of power.) OCTOPOD (an 'enemy' creature that causes damage) and SPHERE (a dangerous energy zapping thing). NOTHING (an empty space or doorway), and WALL (something to crash into -er, avoid, i mean).\n\n there were only so many slots to each circuit board, but you could send the program tree to another board (c doesnt have goto, but i expect this is like calling another (custom) function, and the function returns to where the execution called it from).\n i can't remember if it had any variables for storage (for counting, like in for loops). i think it had logic gates like NOT, AND, OR.\n\n\n the 'look' command could use a cylindrical shape and getfirst/next object in shape. listen/smell can use spheres. i dont know about touch or if that would even be needed. and i also don't know how it would sense walls at all, unless one used only placeable maze wall blocks or something.\n\n i have no idea how you would store a circuit board's script IN a real script, nor how to read/execute it. or any of that sort of thing.\n but my wayward brain and i will leave that up to the scripting experts. ;)\n\n sound fun? challenging? give it a try :)\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2669":{"Title":"Witchblade armour","Author":"Kefrem","Submitted":20050928,"Updated":20051002,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"Someone should model all the various witchblade armous into nwn, like the modern and medieval for both and male phentotypes.","Type":"Models","Description":"Someone should model all the various witchblade armous into nwn, like the modern and medieval for both and male phentotypes.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2670":{"Title":"thor /  asgardians!!!!","Author":"mike  sharrp","Submitted":20050929,"Updated":20051002,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"thor /  asgardian  gods\n\nmasks /  attire  hak!!!!!","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"any haks for asgardian male and female gods\n\nmasks / helmets at nwn vault,\n\nsuch as hippolytha's mask, hela's mask, \n\njolena's mask, with others all featured in one\n\namazing full hak pack???....\n\nif nott,... a professional hak pack creator\n\non here really needs to newly fully create a\n\nnew asgardian gods masks / attire hak pack,....\n\nhmmm,... lisa perhaps,.... or another person.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2671":{"Title":"exotic monk clothing","Author":"some make this please~","Submitted":20050930,"Updated":20051002,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"these are cool","Type":"Items","Description":"the basic monk set is really plain, the CEB isnt what i'm looking for, and the oriental cothing and armour just isnt exotic enough. if someone could just make these, that would give some of us out fill.

This would be for Nwn1 and so version 1.66 and it would use CEP 1.52, as well as SoU and HotU. It would have just the areas, ideally, and perhaps it could also contain some NPCs, but it is in the builders' best interest if they can add their own encounters, story, or treasure. What this would offer... is a time-saver, in terms of areas, and also of NPCs, so that builders can take it from there. The areas would contain all such famous places as the Dragon Isle of Melnibone and it's rival nation Pan Tang, as well as the lesser kingdoms of Karlaak, Jharkor, and others. NPCs can inclunde such personalities as Prince Yrkoon, Cymoril, Jagreen Lern, Theleb Karna, Queen Yishana, and others but I think not Elric, becuase many who make this into a Single Player epic, as I in fact would, might wish to play as the doomed Albino with the demonic sword. The NPCs could be issued seperately as an NPC pack, and the world could be a module or an .erf packed in .rar so as to take up less space and therefore be easier to download. It should turn out relatively small, however, because it would not use any haks but CEP. This way, people can download the world and the NPCs but add what they themselves want, as opposed to being limited to just whatever the mod maker decided.\nAlso... this would only be the major areas that make up Elric's world, so it would be very dial-up friendly. None of the areas should be 32x32; it would be wise to keep them no larger than 16x16 so as to agree with all cpu types out there. Other than this, I think there is nothing to be added except that the idea is perfectly suited for Nwn, and that it would give builders a glorious oppotunity to create their own modules set in this fabulous fantasy world... Also, it should be kept under 150 areas so as to not mess with the in-game time on some people's machines, so things in terms of area would have to be kept to the truly important places only. But if this is not possible, then make it only as large as necessary. We could always take just what we need from it, in any case, and leave what we don't when we, the builders, download it.

However, the addition of tiles with diagonal walls allows for octogonal levels of any size, which can simulate a truly round level extremely well. This allows for decently shaped tower interiors and such which are of any size. \n\nImplementation-wise, this shouldn't be any harder than rounded corners, because the diagonal walls are basically flattened corners. All you do is create one rounded corner that pulls inward until it is flat (or for interior corners, pulls out) so far that it becomes flat. The toolset already knows that you're trying to connect nearby tiles that are at a 90 degree angle, so all that is needed is a \"corner\" that is flat as an option. Using the eraser, a level builder can easily take a stairstep wall and flatten it tile by tile -- creating a diagonal wall as large as is needed. And of course, being able to flatten corners diagonally allows all sorts of non-square and unusual shapes. \n\nSo this fairly simple addition allows for highly diverse map options with a minimum of effort. I'm really shocked this isn't used more, considering the enormous benefits.\n\nI'd really love to see this for the castle interior tileset at the very least.

Nobody likes having their character floating through space, \n\nwalking through or- heavens forbid! stuck inside of- a wall. Nobody likes broken code, nobody likes mods \n\nthat just simply don't work. I didn't climb all the way up here onto this soapbox to talk about those things, \n\nbecause nobody writes broken code on purpose, and everybody has to start somewhere.\n\n No- I'm here to talk to you today about all those little features and qualities that every player desires, \n\nand so often finds lacking- That short little extra mile that any coder could go, but so many don't seem to \n\nthink matters. I'm talkin' 'bout details. No, not the whiskers on your ever-so-lovingly crafted \n\nwere-wombat. *External* details. Packaging and presentation. To cast these problems into a more \n\nfavorable light, perhaps I should have called this list, 'Things Coders Could Do to Make Us More Likely to \n\nDownload Their Stuff', but that title wasn't nearly as catchy.\n\nPeeve Premiere: The worst offense- Lack of clear and illustrative download information. If you've spent \n\nweeks carefully creating a Thing, and you think it's terrific, (even if it still needs polishing,) PLEASE use the \n\n'Description' field to describe it, not to tell us things that we can read elsewhere on the page. This field \n\nexists to lure us, the players, into your creations! Don't tell me it's a PnP for 4th-10th level fighters & \n\nrogues, or that it doesn't require any haks, or that you think it's really neato and we should all download \n\nit. You know what it feels like to pick up a novel with a nifty jacket and search the back cover, inside front, \n\nand both fly leaves for that paragraph that tells you what the book is about, only to find twenty lines of \n\nreview quotes from people you don't know telling you how cool the book and the author are, and a long \n\nlist of other books the author's written that have no bearing on this book at all. It stinks, and leaves you \n\nhalf-commited (at best) to buying & reading that book. So don't do that. \n\nOn the other hand... There is a place that does need all that level, class, and requirements info. You \n\nknow that little column on the right hand side of your module selection screen, after you've told NWN that \n\nyou would like to play something new? There are scores of mods sitting in my directory that I've never \n\nplayed, because I looked to that column and read: \"No information is available for this module.\" I \n\ndownload a LOT of mods, because I love to see what you coders are doing. I think you're bitchin', and \n\nthere's millions of you. Maybe you filled in all the fields on the 'Vault submitter, and maybe I knew what \n\nyour mod was when I initially downloaded it, but now, despite it's clever title, I don't want to play it, \n\nbecause I don't have a clue what character to take in, and the only way to find out is to load it, but I can't \n\nload it until I pick a character, and even then half the time I won't know until ten minutes into the mod, \n\nwhen I discover that no one will talk to me because I played a chaotic, or everyone wants to kill me \n\nbecause I'm an elf. That too, stinks.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of submission fields, there are a bunch, please USE them. I understand \n\nthat some of those are subjective, but subjective information is often better than none. And if your mod \n\nrequires that I have CEP installed, I need to know that before I download it. If your mod requires a DM, I \n\nneed to know. And IF your mod requires me to use only the included pre-generated character, it is VERY \n\nimportant to know. I know some people like that, so I'm not gonna judge, but I don't like playing that way, \n\nand I won't play a mod that expects it. (That's not a peeve, just a matter of personal tastes.)\n\nVeering off a bit, (but still on the topic of providing information,) it is a huge turnoff to read how much you \n\nand/or your mod suck. If you lack confidence, that's cool. If you're a beginner, you can be humble and \n\nadmit it, but don't spend too much valuable description time publicly flogging yourself for it. If you wrote \n\nthe mod in English and it's not your first language, sure, you can say so. \n\nI wasn't going to use this article to rant about poor grammar & spelling- that is a whole huge rant of it's \n\nown- but it's still worth touching on: Perfection isn't required, but at least make the effort. Spell-checkers \n\nmore often than not don't recognize context, but since you've managed to learn how to manage complex \n\ncode with sufficient skill to create a module, you probably have the capacity to differentiate between \n\n\"their\", \"there\", and \"they're\". If not, how hard is it to find someone who can? And I ask this because \n\ndoing so shows pride in your workmanship, not because this really annoys me. Even though it does.\n\nOn the subject of hakpacks: Yes, they're cool, but please try to think from the point of view of your \n\ndownloaders. Don't use huge compilation haks if you don't need to. Some options to consider: \n\nOffer a \"hak-free\" or \"Lite\" version of the mod.\nOffer players the option of downloading a single, larger zipfile, as well as the individual haks. (This covers \n\nboth concerns of modem speed & convenience.)\nMake movies & music optional. \n\nAnd just for good measure, since most of this has been directed at the modders even though I said I was \n\ngoing to talk about content in general, here's one word for the portrait-makers: SCREENSHOTS!\n\nOkay. I've ranted, and I've offered a sort of global constructive criticism. I can only hope it does some \n\ngood. The NWVault can be a terrific forum for sharing creator content. It can also be a vast quagmire of \n\nvague, poorly considered contributions, through which we players must trudge, in search of the rare \n\nshining gems of quality workmanship. If you care about what you've created, and you'd like all of us to \n\ncare as well, don't fall short on the marketing, or you're selling your own hard work short.\n\n","Rating":9,"Awards":[]},"2724":{"Title":"Azeroth!!!","Author":"mjs","Submitted":20051231,"Updated":20060104,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Azeroth","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"Azeroth","Rating":1,"Awards":[]},"2725":{"Title":"Head for royalties","Author":"Alysses","Submitted":20060101,"Updated":20060104,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"Heads for queen and king","Type":"Models","Description":"Could someone please make the head for a beautiful queen, with waistlong hair and a crown (tiara/ diadem -style).

A new idea on how to program hats into NWN, if only some modelers and scripters will read this!","Type":"Models","Description":"Many players have requested hats in NWN and in return they received explanations on why all helmets must be close-faced. Here's my excellent idea: hats and open-faced helmets as EFFECTS, not as equipment!\nThink back to your battle with the armies of the Valsharess. Remember how the Seer's rebel leaders carried flags on their backs? That is actually listed in the Toolset as a visual effect, causing a flag to attach itself to the wearer's back and follow him around as if it were an extra body part. A hat could work the same way. You wouldn't NEED to make an entirely new head model, just the hat. Said hat would appear in the inventory as a USEABLE ITEM, not as a helmet! It would have \"Unique Property, Self Only\" unlimited uses per day, and the script would include the following.\nFirst, read the user's race and gender to distinguish height; specifically the position of the head. The \"hat\" visual effect (again, an effect, not a head model) would be programmed to hover a head-sized distance above the neck, such that the bottom of the hat model would kinda mold into the top of the head model. The program would then check to see if the hat effect is either turned on or off (are you wearing it or not). If off, using the hat item would turn the effect on, causing the hat model to display on the head model. Using the hat item again would turn the effect off again, removing the hat model. Finally, use the \"Extraordinary Effect\" function so that the hat will not disappear when you rest.\nI would do this myself, but I know only a little of scripting (making traps and spells, but certainly not AI), and I know absolutely nothing about making new models; I'm still learning that. So if anyone here at IGN were to successfully pull this off, they would undoubtedly earn the gratitude of hundreds (or thousands?) of players.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2755":{"Title":"Hyborian  Saga!!!","Author":"jerry  shaw","Submitted":20060312,"Updated":20060313,"Category":"Module","Short Description":" Robert E.

The only breaks in this bleakness are small islands of matter broken off from their native dimensions and occassional wide, spinning columns of astral conduits, also called wormholes. Wormholes link the outer planes with each other and with the prime material plane. The Astral is little more than a plane of transit, a means of moving between the inner and outer planes. it is also secondarily a home for extraplanar creatures. The plane has precious few native creatures, and the only power that makes his home here from \"Legends and Lore\" is Anubis of the Egyptian mythos.(excerpt taken from AD&D Manual of the planes by jeff grubb)\n\nNow the idea I have in mind is to create this Plane using custom tilesets with all the emitters, lighting effects, physical features etc.. This plane also has random portals that \"pop\" into existence for brief moments and then dissappear, these portals lead to the various planes of existence that the astral connects to. now here,s the hard part, can a system be constructed, using a custom tileset like this, that can link differrent modules from various authors all together making it seem like one big multiverse with the common link being the astral plane. Players have access to the astral plane via portals, magic items and spells from within the mods themselves so that if a player wishes to leave the Neverwinter area and seek answers or adventure in another plane of existence, say, the Shadowlords genre, then all they have to do is use their magic item of astral travel and port to the astral plane, but of course finding the right portal that leads to the shadowlords world in an infinite sea would be something altogether differrent, perhaps one can get a copy of \"hitchhikers guide to the planes\".

Rather, the character would fly through the air (like the rats in Cania) and into the chest's open mouth. The mimic would then let out a loud belch and shut its lid. \nThe victim? Haven't decided that. Maybe that could be \"Game Over\" (in which case, definitely include a saving throw). Or the PC could become \"cutscene-invisible\", the player could lose control of the PC, and the PC could be assigned a command to follow the mimic around (since he's locked inside the chest) until the mimic is destroyed. \nThis could probably be hard, if not impossible, to script. But at least reading this would give you readers a pretty funny scenario to visualize. Think of how hilarious it would be to see someone on multiplayer fly off their feet through the air toward an open treasure chest, land head-first into its maw, and scream out angry overhead-text-display comments as the mimic waddles off happily with the player locked beneath the closed lid! :D","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2771":{"Title":"fantastic modules","Author":"Rhapsody","Submitted":20060407,"Updated":20060413,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"4 ideas for four modules because idk how 2 create modules","Type":"Other","Description":"heres a link: http://www.mightyrhapsody.com/index.php\n\ni didnt think it up so dont give me credit","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2772":{"Title":"Halo","Author":"Skeez","Submitted":20060407,"Updated":20060413,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"A request to make halo things for nwn","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"I would REALLY like to see more halo things.

There seems to be a widely varying level of interest in module romances among players, ranging from disdain to criticism that there aren't more of them (or more well written ones). Since I've always found such romances to be the most interesting aspect of RP Gaming, and since I'm in the process of writing a module that includes a romance, I'm interested in understanding better the NWN community's general opinions on them.\n\nHere are some of the questions I wanted to ask for feedback on:\n\n1. What makes for a well written romance? Is it enough for a romantic interest to be an NPC, or should they be a henchman? How much does the partnership of adventuring together go toward making for a good module romance?\n\n2. Is there a real difference among male and female gamers in terms of interest in module romances? The cliche is that more women are interested in romances than men. Is this true, or are there a sizable number of men who (like myself) also enjoy a well written module romance?\n\n3. What are peoples' specific turn-ons and turn-offs regarding a romance? What kinds of characters are interesting and attractive, and which not?\n\n4. How overt does a module romance need to be? Where on the spectrum from flirting to marriage do you prefer your romances to stop?\n\nI suppose there are a lot of other questions I could ask, but I think this is enough to get started. I'm hoping that this feedback will be useful to myself, as well as to other module plotters, in understanding what the NWN community likes and doesn't like with regard to module romances.\n\n\n\n","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"2783":{"Title":"Anime Bunny Head","Author":"cheetachaser","Submitted":20060509,"Updated":20060522,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"Anime Bunny Heads!","Type":"Models","Description":"we need an anime bunny head... ive seen foxling heads... catling heads... dogling heads... everything else heads... but no bunnylinig heads!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2784":{"Title":"Server restarter","Author":"Godion (Marry)","Submitted":20060510,"Updated":20060522,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"Server restarter","Type":"Suggestions","Description":"Some people would appericiade it if any hoster on the game that has a 100% working server restarter ( if the server crashes, that the server restarter restart the server automaticly ) could post it on the neverwinter vault so that other hosters can download it too, because we all hate hackers and when i put my server online, i go away and a guy crash my server iam not happy, cuz i cant drive to home again to set it up again.

Recomandations: lot of patience, details paranoid :P, epic fan.","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"Once upon a time, long long ago(or maybe long after the uprising from the underdark)...In a land splited between overwhelming magic: elves, draws, ilthid, gnomes(also with engeneering) - brute force: orcs, dwarves, druegar - thievery: halflings, snieb., humans are caught in the middle, often founded themselves as slaves and upperviewed from\nthe other races, especially elves and orcs. They live just a little above the animal state, being sold by their own kind slave merchants and having little hope. In this times where human versatility was unknown, one man became aware of his power (maybe because of a god: Thor, or Odin or just make something up) and revolted (after his woman got raped and killed by elves or orcs or his mother) and run away learning to hide and strike without armor or weapon (a monk evolving into assassin or shadowdancer maybe?), avoiding magic and using oponent's strength, robbing the weakest of races to live: halflings-dirty thieves, chaotic evil, having to sneak in the woods cose the druids would kill him on spot. Using his shadow techniques he tumble over a very remote temple in the desert(or very cold/snow/remote enviroment) where an old human (once a scribe slave to an elf) teaches him to write and read, gives him shelter and teaches him moral values but his temper refuses to accept a refugee's life. Also u can add bounty hunters(slaver B.H.) who search for him. He wonders through the realms and frees different individuals, an entire village (or two) and builds The (God's name) Thor Avengers' Order, or in the name of the god of justified hate (hatelord's order) etc. -use ur imagination. There can be a Trium alliance of Immortals (since elves , drows and gnomes live very long) and an alliance between the fighters: orcs, goblins, halflings, dwarves- and the humans caught in the middle as slaves(or imagine a conflict on pairs as long as humans don't play (yet) an importal role, they r just slaving; conflict that will allow the Order to evolve and other races become aware and want to whipe them out. The son of the founding father will take the lead of the town, struggle for surviving and ultimately exterminating the other races from the face of this huge island maybe. Or help the elves who are under attack of the drow, demons, orcs (the red alliance or something like that) and win their freedom. Also the new Clan/Order must have a symbol, strong and simple: maybe a celtic cross, or yin/yang or something as ur choosing. If u find the ideea interesting enough to start building the module, I can put my imagination at work and come up with more. Oh, the module has to be restricted to Human-Male/Monk/Lawful Evil/Level1 for start and future events must keep him on monk/assassin/shadowdancer(or just monk) path. The son can be his father with different equipment, maybe some experience added{also, at the beggining of the module try to lower father's lawful to minimum, maybe even chaotic, not being able to evolve to monk but through certain events that makes him (or maybe his son) lawful; father might start as good or neutral and the son to become the real Lawful Evil Hatelord}. The father must be the one that puts the base of a human citadel and when his son becomes adult the area changes to a rustic-stone town(but not a neat one like neverwinter, remember humans aren't yet very skilled architects). Remember, keep the character's alignment very restrictive and maybe allow him to chose and alliance with elves or other, or exterminate all other races from the continent. {as a little detail, the humans (father) can refuge on a small island, maybe become pirates for a little while}. Or you could make this human uprising as the reason that mythical races became extinct. Good luck, healthy imagination and flawless work:). And remember the Order's motto: Hate and Honour!\n\nP.S. I know there are alot of ppl. who will find the idea above to be very offensive, but I assure them it's not intended and I appologise.

That being said, any simple function like this should have already been done.\nSecondly, the use of such a function would allow the creation of many more magical items, spells, and more playability in my opinion.\nImagine a spell able to steal spell uses from a caster, or absorb them as they are being cast. A ring that doesnt just grant extra spell slots, but fills them up periodically.\nIts just so simple that im not sure why its not already in there. \n3rd readon: If its just a matter of exploits, then forget about that. People who want to exploit anything will eventually do it for a time. \nI'm only requesting this for additional content purposes. Content is what this game is about, so any little script function like this should already be in the system.\n\nI see that the Decrement function does not actually close spell slots, but removes a use of a single spell use, a spell that is ready in memory. So a reverse function would need to know what spell to replace, or insert.\nScripts could be attached to spells that allowed replenishment after a time. Books and tomes could be read (activated) which give a player an extra use of a spell each time they are read. \nIn effect, whole new magic systems could be created.\nPersonally, I prefer the mana point systems most rpg games use. But I also believe that the old spell slot system has its place. It just needs more options.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2850":{"Title":"End time item's like gas mask","Author":"Raven_Xan","Submitted":20060911,"Updated":20060913,"Category":"Expansion","Short Description":"End time item's like this from degenesis, or shadowrun, or other...\nScreenshot's added from degenesis!","Type":"Request to be created","Description":"I think a end time scenario is in NWN possible but it been missing some model's and textures for this!\nLike a gas mask or other...\n\nThis screenshot's I have added are from \"degenesis\", that's a end time pen&paper RPG.\n\nPossible or not?","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2851":{"Title":"Make Dire Wolf Into the Winter Wold","Author":"BladeRaiden","Submitted":20060913,"Updated":20060913,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"I wanted to always have a Pet Winter Wolf for a ranger/druid as an animal companion so i wondered if its possible to eaither add a winter wolf to the animal campanion list or replace an existing one","Type":"Monsters","Description":"I wanted to always have a Pet Winter Wolf for a ranger/druid as an animal companion so i wondered if its possible to eaither add a winter wolf to the animal campanion list or replace an existing one","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2852":{"Title":"The 'brown cloak',  with customized colors","Author":"'Myth'","Submitted":20060913,"Updated":20060921,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"Can anyone make the 'brown cloak' so they allow for the colors to be changed using a die-kit (cloth, leather, and metal).

city close to the underdark)\n\n","Type":"Other","Description":"Skullport, the crack of Faerun.\n\nFull of brothels, slave pens and posts, monsters trading in flesh, bad food, bad company, Zombie laborers, and intelligent skeletons from Netheril culture called \"The Skulls\".\n\nThis boil on Faerun's arse is somewhere in the underdark...\n\nlinked to by portals all over faerun.\n\nand a place full of greedy scoundrels and slaves of all races. full of so many monstrous creatures that nothing else compares to it. \n\n(mentioned so much because that's what folks come to skullport for. trade in flesh)\n\nEvery Cycle (12 hours), at least one creature falls thru the hempen roads above, causing creatures to splat on the ground. causing passerby to flock to the unfortunate victem, and steal his coinpurse.\n\nThe Skulls, Netherise wizards trapped in their own bones, left over from collapses in systems of tunnels, use thier power randomly, at chaotic intervals. the fear of being wrote out of existence by them creates order with chaos.\n\nThe city is ruled by many parties, and a \ngroup called the Kracken society handles news, gossip, and such around skullport.\n\nBut the real power belongs not just to the Skulls, but A Beholder and a Yaun-Ti, both slavers, constantly fueding.\n\n\n(UNIQUE SYSTEMS)\n\nthe danger systems, such as the scripts that handle things like falling from hempen roads and falling to a splat. just as likely to affect NPC's as PC's.\n\nDeath token system, using obsidion skulls. these give you the favor of the skulls, allowing them to resserect you upon death once per skull. if you don't have one of these, you have to wait for a cleric to raise you from your corpse... not a common occurence.\n\nKracken watch: A large group of PC's and NPC's will be watching you. this allows for the skulls to exact random justice (that being killing a random creature that broke at least 3 of the place's laws, and then (in the case of PC's) deleting the character)\n\nThe slave system:\n\nbuying a slave at a post gives you a token that, when used, creates a slave of a specific creature type and gender.\nthis is a member of your party.\n\ninteractions with these creatures depend on the race, your race, the gender, and your gender.\n\nmost are VERY filthy and smelly, so having one around gives you a -2 to concentration checks, unless you, once every 12 in game hours, use a bucket and sponge to have them clean themselves.\n\n\nZombie labor system: a dead slave, when targeted with a wand of necromancy, creates a zombie servent.\n\nPortal system: all locations of Faerun have at least one portal linked to Skullport. more in unsavory locations.\n\nthis means that you, the player, can access: The underdark thru the docks, and any other server that takes place in faerun.\n\n\n\n\nThis PW idea would be a break from the norm.\n\nit would be a place where you buy things that would likely be illegal.\n\nand it would be the boil on the crack of faerun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"2886":{"Title":"Dragonlance  Uncensored","Author":"jerry  shaw","Submitted":20061120,"Updated":20061123,"Category":"Module","Short

But one thing has never been done before: placeable mountains. I was looking at the CEP's useful \"Devil's Tower\" placeable and it struck me that if placeable cliffs such as these were possible, why couldn't some talented placeable maker come up with placeable mountains, of various shapes and sizes, for Nwn? I'm thinking of really craggy, mountainous-looking mountains, not hill-like slopes such as you get with tileset mountains like in Hills and Homes. There could be, say, small, medium, and large-size mountians which could be fit into small, medium, and large-size areas depending on the builder's need. This would make it less of a necessity to depend on tilesets or tileset modifications, for mountainous terrain, and allow builders to be able to place mountains anywhere they wish: on land, in the water, or even rising up from chasms... for example. None of which is possible with Hills and Homes or Rocky Mountains, but which would be *very* possible with placeables such as those I'm proposing. Players wouldn't be able to walk on them, instead they would be used similarly to the \"Devil's Tower\", as a terrain obstruction, but one of larger scale. They must be easy on the in-game performance, so nothing too high in the poly-count or too hard in the textures department! So consider creating something even users of older video cards can use... for the sake of fairness to everyone. I've not skill or resources to create such a thing myself but if there are any talented placeable creators out there who agree that this is something which could be useful to have in Nwn, now is the time to see if such a creation can become a reality.

Using limited PW scripting (Item variable storage, and limited Default database storage), create","Type":"Complete Adventures","Description":"So what does all this mean? \n\nThe key element of the idea here is that instead of releasing separate and modules that each have to be self contained and reuse content from old modules to continue a series. Use a single module which can be expanded upon and can evolve/improve with patches. Part of the problem with doing this normally, lies in the fact that module changes render game saves useless� \n\nThus if you make a normal SP module, and it is otherwise good, but has a game breaking bug, if you fix that bug, all progress made in the module is lost and must be restarted� Furthermore, if you wished you could have added more content to the module but for whatever reason decided to release ahead of schedule, you normally cannot do this without the same problem. \n\nHowever by using some basic persistence coding it is theoretically possible to create a module which can be updated regularly with both bug fixes, and new content, without breaking any save games, because the PC can save the most relevant data persistently using a combination of default NWN database methods, and item variable storing. (Item variable storing is effectively storing a variable on an item which is stored when a character is exported to the MP vault). \n\nIndeed, in theory the player never need save the game by traditional methods (as with a large module, saving can be a chore and prone to hang-ups). \n\nI have already begun work on the module and it�s systems, and currently it is intended to run like a very structured and story driven mini Persistent world. Truly a mix of the best of both worlds. \n\nMake no mistake, this module is NOT suitable to be run on a server and allow just anyone to join. It is intended to be played either solo, with a single party, DM optional. \n\nAdditionally, the ultimate goal is to allow DM�s and other builders to use this base concept and adapt it as they wish to expand their own ideas� Build in their own quests (into the existing module) or run their own adventures. \n\nThe Setting of Eberron was chosen because it allowed me an opportunity to introduce a new setting that people would be familiar with, one that has only been marginally attempted in the past. \n\nWhile this module won�t have the same easy capacity to be heavily story and event driven like a true single player module, it will have that sandbox quality that should allow you to explore the world (at least what there is that is included/added later) as you see fit. \n\nUnlike a true PW, the module won�t track every little detail about your PC or their condition� Only those that would break a game if they aren�t stored. \n\nThings such as storing HP�s, death states, Spell uses, and so on are not things I consider all that imperative, if you want to cheat by reloading the module and getting around a party wipe, or bad decision, that�s fine by me� As your not competing with strangers on a public (or even pass worded server), how you play the game is up to you. \n\nInstead things like quest states, banking, housing, factions and events are things I will be storing. \n\nThe module should consist of a combination of generic side quest adventures, multi part storyline adventures (Adventures spanning multiple quests) and potentially world altering events (Do a quest for one group or faction and it may have minor but noticeable ripples). \n\nIn addition to these new concepts, the module will make use of the C.R.A.P. System, with advanced henchman support. \n\nA word on henchman:\nIt is intended to include several interesting henchman each with their own personalities, back stories and interests right from the start. As expansion of the module continues, surely new henchman will be added. Henchman will be stored persistently, and as your PC advances, so too will they to match� If you decide to start with a new player, simply replace the indicated database storing the henchman (backup if desired before doing this), and you can �refresh� your henchman back to their original default capacity. \n\nA word on role-playing: The mere fact that I am using the C.R.A.P. supplements, should indicate that I intend the module to be at least respectably role play oriented with role play dialogue options wherever prudent (solve quests without fighting, gather information from the world). \n\nRight now the world is in the early alpha stage, and the reason I�m writing this, is to see what kind of response such a module might garner from the old NWN 1 crowd. \n\nWhy not NWNII? Simple� 1, I don�t have a PC that can run it well enough to build with it. 2 NWN I is far more mature and has the bare minimum of elements (thanks to hak sets adding wonderful new content) to make an Eberron Module possible. \n\nSo if you read this far, here are the criteria I want you to consider for helping you in voting choices, please, I ask that if you read this idea thus far, don�t leave me hanging a vote and a simple comment is all I ask. (So of course vote however you wish):\n\nVote high if you think this is a module you would like to see completed. \nVote high if you like the premise of using limited persistence to make an upgradable module possible. \nVote high if you want to see an Eberron module of any kind. \nVote low only if the entire idea strikes you as something you wouldn�t be interested in seeing. \n\nI also welcome any questions or feedback. Remember this is early alpha and is a solo project (by design right now), and currently writing up the design documents and creating the base module/systems is the only tangible work started. \n","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"2942":{"Title":"Skeletal Horses/Mounts","Author":"Uze","Submitted":20070910,"Updated":20070911,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"I would like to see someone make some skeleton mounts.","Type":"Models","Description":"I would like to see someone make some skeleton mounts.

Lore? Search?).\n~ Cold iron anathema: -2 on attack rolls when weilding weapons made only partially out of cold iron (spears, arrows, etc) [I don't think this could be incorporated]\n~ Manifest Nature's Might: This is where it gets tricky. Each day, a killoren can manifest one of three aspects of nature. They spend 10 minutes in meditation, and they gain bonuses or abilities, as well as a change in look, depending on which. I figure it could work like a single special ability with three options. They are as follows:\nAspect of the Ancient: Bonus on Lore checks equal to Hit Dice, additional +2 bonus on saves vs enchantment effects. White hair, blue eyes.\nAspect of the Destroyer: One per hour (a maximum times per day equal to the killoren's Charisma bonus, minimum 1), may make a special smite attack against foes of nature (aberrations, constructs, humanoids, oozes, outsiders and undead only). When making this smite attack, the killoren adds their Charisma bonus to their attack roll, and deals an extra 1 point of damage per Hit Die. Black eyes and hair.\nAspecct of the Hunter: +2 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot. +2 racial bonus on initiative checks. Deep green eyes and hair, deep drown skin.\n\nKilloren look like half-elves, but with green or brown skin, and grass-like hair. I don't think any new models need to be made. They do not have a level adjustment, because they can only manifest one aspect of nature at a time.\n\nThere are racial feats that killoren can get, so it would make sense to include those. The feats provide additional features to each aspect, for example, the Killoren Destroyer feat dazes an enemy hit by the smite attack on a failed Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 character level + Cha modifier).

Armor attachments, belts and capes can further customize such an outfit. Its very important that the surcoat can be colored, perhaps in patterns even. There could also be versions with different lenghts of surcoats, longer versions might be good for cults. \n\n-a combined version of the chain helmet with soldier style helmets. \n\nThis would simply be for variety's sake. Both elements are in the game, they would need to be merged into one helmet. \n\n-A long coat. \n\nThis could be ideal for rogues, spies, mages and all kinds of secretive figures. Some care might need to be taken to not make it looking too modern. A worn variation could be good for rogues and such. \nThere could also be a leather version as light armor.\n\n-A plain hard leather cuircass. \n\nThis would be easy to customize with armor attachments, belts and capes. Simple clothing could be worn under it, and perhaps there could be bare arms. Patterns, symbols and decorations could be on the leather cuircass as well, or on variations of it.\n\n-A typical conan style outfit.\n\nThis would be badly needed for barbarians. The base outfit would be just a loincloth thats not overly small, and a few leather straps around their chest. For the female version there could be a loincloth over the chest as well. When the leather straps are placed correctly, armor attachments such as shoulder pads would look attached to the straps when put on the outfit. \nThere could also be variations with some chainmail or scale mail attached to it for medium armor. \n\n-Skull shaped helmets. \n\nThis would be ideal for necromancers and all kinds of evil characters. There could be horned versions as well. \n\n-weapon belts. \n\nThis might be a tricky one considering clipping, but I have suggestions that might work. There is a belt that goes over one shoulder with a knife on it, maybe a different version could be made of this with several smaller knives, or with a sword or an axe on the back. \nBelts with longswords, shorswords or daggers might cause clipping, but it might be possible. \nAnother idea would be to put a dagger around a thigh, arm or shin as an armor attachment. \n\n-Feathered helmets. \n\nThere are quite a few helmets, but sadly none with beautifull feathers on top of them. This could make a usefull addition. \n\n-Elven plate armor. \nAll the heavy armor suits seem rather rough, a delicate design with fine patterns could be great for races such as elves. A matching helmet and armor attachments could make it complete. \n\n-more monk robes.\n \nThere seem to be just one monk outfit and its not really flattering, it doesnt look like something for warrior monks. I would like to suggest to use bare arms, a simple pants, a sash around the waist and a sash over one shoulder. There would be a cloth top for females. \n\nWell that is all I can think of for now, I am not a modder myself but I hope to have given some good ideas for modders.

There are two ways of dealing with this issue. The first one is using flags which will spawn creatures/npcs/objects on entering a location and despawn them while leaving it. This is quite convenient since we have a general idea of where such an element would be created. The second way is to save the creatures/npcs/objects and the co-ordinates of their last spawn/despawn in a SQL data base.\nBut despite the fact that the second system has a big advantage since it allows an MG to create the world on a progressive basis (if something, which has been created by an MG gets destroyed it stays destroyed after a reboot), it also has one disadvantage-namely that if one wishes to have a look at the elements in the Aurora Toolset it becomes impossible to determine the location of the elements in-game.\nDuring a discussion on how to reduce lags of CNR (Craftable Natural Resources) it turned out that useable objects lag the server even if there is no player on that location.\nNow to come to the point-I did some thinking on the subject and came up with an interesting solution. What if we could create a tool that would store the data and co-ordinates of creatures/npcs/objects to a SQL data base and then would erase them from the module (and vice versa � meaning it would also upload the data from the SQL onto the module). I asked around and from what my friends told me it seems this would have to be done by an external program (e.g. One written in Java) which would edit the contents of the *.git and *.gic files. But isnt there a simpler way? Like making a program which would change objects or flag spawn triggers?

While he was exploring Hell, somehow by chance he found a long abandoned sword that was jutted into the ground with a corpse that seems to look like a demon of epic proportions. (He�s got that Mephis look to him). The Dark Knight decides to pull the sword out. And the Demon awakens and thanks him from his long sleep and tells him he is the Prince of Hell called Draginor. And with his awakening he granted to merge with the Dark Knight to give him the status of a GOD! \n\nHe leaves along with the other villains and decides to destroy the city where the zombies from SH1 laid waste and replace it with his own version. A Fortress city of great evil and terror from the bowels of hell itself. He decides to enslave the people nearby and make them work in the city and torture and various other acts�(you all get the idea).\n\nHe realizes and his villain companions that the heroes will return to stop them and so they constructed seven towers involving each sin of man to block the entry into the fortress should they somehow slip into the city of horror�..He also still has powers left over from SH2 and puts them to great use by creating otherworld pockets across the land causing mayhem and terror.\n\n\nWell that�s the main bulk of what�s gonna happen but l�ll leave that to Erik and the community if they wish to change anything.\n\nPART 1:\nWill revolve around getting through the destruction across the land and trying to reach the Demon Fortress City,\n\nThe final boss for this will be the Thunder Demon since he was the weakest of them all.\n\nPART 2:\nWill involve once into the city and destroying each tower of Sin to gain entry into the Castle of Hell.\n\nThe final boss for this will be the villain from A new journey begins.\n\nPART 3:\nEntering the Castle of Hell that�s ten floors high and getting through all of the horrors that it offers.\n\nGrand Finale Boss:\nBasically he�ll have three forms since I want this to go out with a bang and hopefully remembered by the community as one of the best modules out there!\n\nThe Dark Knight: Once again you face the Dark Knight under the Red dark skies with deadly thunder as you two fight.\n\nThe Prince of Hell: The Dark Knight isn�t dead yet, he lets him take over and fights YOU! The only problem is that he is not mortal. How can you defeat him�?\n\nThe Prince of Terror and Hell: After realizing his weakness, the Dark Knight lets him transform his body into a being so terrible even the heavens would be scared of him.\n\nAnd the EPIC battle begins!\n\n\nHope you all like the summary of the story!

It's silly I know, but this was a long time ago.\n I think some kind of trigger around a table, which checks to see when a person enters, call for a waiter to get the order, e.t.c. If they exit, and haven't payed, something nasty happens, or something like that. But essentially, you could have people (who really take RPing to the limit) getting up to answer the call of nature, and this would make them suddenly a criminal. So the trigger should check to make sure EVERYONE has left until it checks paid or not.\n A dialog could open when a waiter(ess) appears, obviously, and you choose what you want. But then, said waiter(ess) goes to the NEXT person at the table. I found this tricky.\n Perhaps a certain word or sentance that a listener could pick up said by the PC, to tell when they want to pay the bill and leave. Or you could pay up front, but lets try to be classy here.\n A menu? (this one I found the easiest :-)\n One thing that I would find difficult, if I was any good at scripting, would be to maintain the scripts head from exlpoding with several meals going on at once. The waiter could have one LONG action queue, and that's bad. Maybe a waiter spawns for each table, and dissapears after the PC(s) has left?\n Anyway, this would be a great addition to the NWN RPing world, and I can understand if people think making it would be a silly waste of time,\n but any more ideas, or explanation, just leave a comment, and I'll use my grey matter to try my best to help.\n Somebody please find the time to make this, cheers\n -Swell Guy","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3084":{"Title":"PRC Sigil","Author":"Shadow_Stormtrooper","Submitted":20090322,"Updated":20090322,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"An idea for a more complete version of Planescape than those currently online in Neverwinter Nights 1.","Type":"Other","Description":"Planescape, although the current server I have seen of it is quite good asfar as size goes, I think that a big improvment would be the addition of the PRC to the setting due to it's vast score of classes and races with full abilities that would fill in the settin quite well.

If you�re attempting to sunder a weapon or shield, follow the steps outlined here. (Attacking held objects other than weapons or shields is covered below.)\n\nStep 1\nAttack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target whose weapon or shield you are trying to sunder. (If you have the Improved Sunder feat, you don�t incur an attack of opportunity for making the attempt.)\n\nStep 2\nOpposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a sunder attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a -4 penalty. If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in size category.\n\nStep 3\nConsequences. If you beat the defender, roll damage and deal it to the weapon or shield. See Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points to determine how much damage you must deal to destroy the weapon or shield.\n\nIf you fail the sunder attempt, you don�t deal any damage.\n\n\nSundering a Carried or Worn Object\n\nYou don�t use an opposed attack roll to damage a carried or worn object. Instead, just make an attack roll against the object�s AC. A carried or worn object�s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier + the Dexterity modifier of the carrying or wearing character. Attacking a carried or worn object provokes an attack of opportunity just as attacking a held object does. To attempt to snatch away an item worn by a defender rather than damage it, see Disarm. You can�t sunder armor worn by another character.

Typical creatures don't represent them well, because birds flit around, usually out of the reach of adventuring characters. I suggest VFX to represent them.\n\nMy idea is for a series of VFX depicting small birds in flight. They could range from one to many birds, and could have them flying along a horizontal axis (e.g., overhead) or a vertical one (say, out of bushes or long grass). I imagine they could be created by triggers, so a character approaching a thicket would be greeted by a flock of birds fleeing. I think something like this could add a lot of immersion to the game if implemented properly.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3110":{"Title":"New Angels, Archons, Demons and Devils","Author":"BePower","Submitted":20091025,"Updated":20091025,"Category":"Expansion","Short Description":"If someone can model these guys it would be AWESOME!","Type":"Monsters","Description":"Foreword: demons and devils, as in angels and archons, are not opposed races in this idea, but rather ranks among them in hell or heavens. Devils are higher ranking (and more powerful) than demons as archons are to angels.\n\n\nDemons\n\nDemons are a chaotic evil conjurers best ally and are best used against people who can't tank well (unless you're using the challegha which just owns everyone, including you sometimes). Also note you give up fly/protective shield/damage reduction communes that the devil/archons give you. They regenerate a lot more health per tick than devils and archons, especially with the chaotic regeneration edge that only chaotic conjurers can get. All demons need to be kept happy otherwise they will turn on you when the binding wears off, however the challegha will turn on you even if happy should your hp drop below 25% unless you have the murderous reputation edge. Demons will also autoattack other demons, angels, archons, and some demons also autoattack good-aligned priests and mages. So if you are grouped with another conjurer, make sure they use a devil. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChallegha\nShort Desc \n\nA flabby toad-like demon squats here, croaking and burbling. \nLong Desc \n\nStinking drool hangs in putrid strings from the sagging, shapeless lips of this \ndemon's bobbing toadish head. Its spindly arms hang lifeless at its sides, tiny \nsucker-shaped fingers poised like ineffectual claws. The stench of sweat and \nurine hangs palpably in the air near this slit-eyed beast. \nAttack type \n\nSuction (blunt) \nSpecial Abilities \n\n\nAcid Blast. Large single target nuke. Can do immense damage (OBLITERATES). \nVitriolic Stream. Channeled multi-round acid damage exactly what invoker can do. Broken when target flees. \nDisarm. Will disarm weapon from enemy if it can be disarmed. \nOoze Shield. Exactly like invoker shield, some damage reduction, full ooze immunity. [immunity to acid, poison, grapple]\n\n*Eating corpses makes him happy. \n\nChallegha Tactics\n\nThe Challegha demon is possibly the best leveling demon of them all. To please it, all you have to do is allow it to eat corpses. It will, however, attack ANYONE (including you and your groupmates) that are under 25% health. Its high single target damage means that it won't accidently area attack something. For pvp, this demon is AWESOME. Acid Blast is a killer spell that will suddenly take out a chunk of hp from your enemy however the stream of acid, while powerful, is easily evaded by fleeing unless you can stun them. Will also autoattack any shapeshifters who are not in your group. This demon is supremely powerful but is also the hardest to control successfully as it will betray you should you EVER have your HP taken down to 25% unless you have the murderous reputation edge. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMors-gravis\nShort Desc \n\nLong Desc \n\nAttack type \n\nBeating (blunt) \nIt occasionally does extra attacks between rounds. \nSpecial Abilities \n\nMental knife. -int, mental damage, good against mages and priests.</i> \nDispel. Target will have communes and magic dispelled. \nConfuse. Hard to target, if you have this and target someone in room, you \"might\" hit someone else in room instead. \nBash. Lag move, usually fails however. [like knockdown]\n\n*Killing priests makes him happy. \n\nMors-gravis Tactics\n\nThe mors-gravis demon is usually the easiest demon to please. It will autoattack good-align priests and killing priest mobs is the best way to make him happy. Awesome demon to use against priests and mages due to dispel, mental knife, and confusion. Can also tank relatively well due to its inherent resistance to physical damage (like giant resist). [20% resistance to slash/pierce/blunt]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWinged Morosa\nShort Desc \n\nLong Desc \n\nSegmented horns curl from the brow and jaw of this broad-mouthed demon in the shape of a flattened star. Its bulging eyes dance around beneath a bony brow and wild tufts of soot-colored hair. With horned wings expanding in a five-pace arc around its shoulders to the lashing tip of its barbed tail the demon can take flight with amazing speed and strength, carrying heavy loads with ease in its taloned hands. \n\nAttack type \n\nSlice (slashing) \nSpecial Abilities \n\nFear. Often prevents a target re-engaging in any fight, and they will auto-flee when taking damage unlagged. \nGore. Like minotaur gore, can lag smaller foes. \nBash. Lag move, will succeed FAR more than the mors-gravis. [like knockdown]\nEarthbind. Removes flight ability from arials, clouds [cloud giants], and fly spell/commune from others. \nTrip. Lag move, will be used after earthbind if he is happy enough. \nChain Lightning. Lightning damage. Will bounce back-and-forth between all nearby targets, reducing in damage until it hits zero. Will hit himself and sometimes you as well. \n\n*Needs to eat corpses and loot magic items from corpses to be happy. \n\nMorosa Tactics\n\nThis is your lagging demon, especially on small-sized foes as gore goes off often and can 'toss' them to one side like a minotaur for lag. It is also smart enough to earthbind flying foes and trip them to death if hes happy enough. He can get somewhat happy when eating corpses but it needs to loot magical items (wands, scrolls, staves, ect) from the corpse to really go into overdrive when used to pk (give a weak wand to a mob and kill it with autosac off and it'll be happy enough to PK with). Be aware that it can and will damage itself heavily with chain lightning (and will sometimes die to it), but against arials it's kickass against. Will also autoattack all good-aligned invokers and conjurers. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteel-eyed Harmentia\nLong desc \n\nThe sublime beauty of this female demon's face is marred only by her snake-like eyes, steely gray and staring without compassion or mercy. Three arms sprout from either side of her broad shoulders, each bearing a blade or dagger, each lashing around her with the skill of any mortal master swordsman. Beneath her bared breast and muscle-rippled abdomen her supple flesh turns coarse and scaly and where you expect to find hips and legs you find the iron-hard scales of a serpent, her tail coiling beneath her and undulating to move her like a sidewinder across the desert sands. \n\nAttack type \n\nSlice (slashing) \nOccasionally does extra attacks between rounds. \nSpecial Abilities \n\nFireball. Fire damage, hits ALL in room except you, your groupmates, and cabalmates. \nPoison stream. Starting from -5, each full hit lowers strength more (stacks for a lot). \nA steel-eyed harmentia demon bares her teeth and spits a fine stream of poison at the target. \nThe target avoids most of the poison. - Note, no strength loss here unless it's the first hit. \nA steel-eyed harmentia demon's stream of poison grazes the target! \nAfflict. Exactly like shaman's afflict, can do various maledictions. \n\n*Needs to eat corpses and loot weapons from corpses to be happy. \n\nHarmentia Tactics\n\nWill auto-attack good-align warriors, paladins, and priests. Is somewhat happy eating corpses but gets REALLY happy when it loots weapons from those corpses. It's -str poison spit is very strong in long battles and it does a lot of physical damage (it's hasted). The fireballs are area attack and tend to bring other things into the fight however and the harmentia is not a good tanker. It's best used in PK but be wary as it does need to be pleased -before- you go out with it. Give some weapons to a fair level Mob, kill it, let it loot the unsacrificed corpse. \n\n\n\nDevils\n\nDevils are the ally of the orderly evil conjurer. They can not be attacked by area spells/abilities and will assist the conjurer with spells. They are made happiest when killing the conjurer's enemies (good, evil, neutral, it doesn't matter), however they get pretty pissed off if the conjurer flee's and/or word of recalls out of a fight. Will attack the conjurer if they run away from fights to often unless they have the murderous reputation edge. \n\nThere are four classes of devils, each one needing more and more mana to reach during a conjuration. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlack Abishai Devil\nSpells it casts on conjurer \n\n\nAura [40% damage resistance vs all types of damage]\nBarrier (Only in a fight) [idem, but they do not stack well, if the 2 are cast the total is 60%]\nProtective Shield \nSpiderhands [makes impossible to be disarmed, but subs to +10 discipline?]\nFly \nSpells it casts on enemy \n\n\nCurse. \nBlindness. \nWeaken. \nPoison \nFireball.

Also note you give up fly/protective shield/damage reduction communes that the devil/archons give you. They regenerate a lot more health per tick than devils and archons, especially with the chaotic regeneration edge that only chaotic conjurers can get. All angels autoattack demons, anti-paladins, and necromancers. Unlike demons, angels are easily pleased by attacking evil mobs/people, in fact, even evil conjurers can use them as long as they attack ONLY evil creatures. Angels will break their bonding real fast and attack you should you use them to attack good mobs/people, especially if you are evil. Also archangel's can do critical-hit style attacks on strong APs[Anti-Paladins]. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWinged angel\nShort Desc \n\nA fierce winged angel stands here, bathed in a holy aura. \nLong Desc \n\nBeautiful beyond description the features of this holy being are sublime even in their ferocity. White, feathered wings rise in gentle arcs from its back and \nluminous white robes hang from its larger-than-human form.

They do not engage in combat (apart from the occasional offensive magic) unless someone attacks it, and in this case they stop \"benedicting\" the conjurer with the defensive magics until the problem is removed, which also happens if they are blinded.\n\nLuminous\n(White Aura) A hovering figure borne by a halo of white light is here. -A servant of the Gods of Light, the archon towers before you a pillar of radiance and warmth.

I looked over the script segments, and I think it have everything it needs there, but am at a loss as to how to go about it. I assume the spell would give you a selection cursor, then copy the item thats on the ground (for example, a key), destroy the original, and then add the copy to the PC's inventory, Ideally with a little magical effect of a ball of light going there and back.

All credit for ideas and concepts for this mod goes to Blizzard of course. LOOKING FOR TESTERS!!!!\n\nMy point in creating this mod, was to steer clear from the other crappy d2 mods out there. It's my mission to make the best d2 - LoD mod in existence. :)\nCheck out these screenies!\n\nFEATURES OF THIS MOD.\n-Every single area that was a part of Diablo 2:LoD, acts 1-5 and EVENTUALLY an act 6 and 7 including Azmodan and Belial.\n\n-every monster that was a part of the bestiary of D2, given the most accurate NWN/CEP models available. Customized NPC's with COMPLETE original quest texts, as well as given models and clothing that stays true to the original game.\n\n-Original D2 LoD music, including tristram and the rogue encampment. Added to all of the areas they are in the original game.\n\n-Customized vendor loot, all armors realistic looking, as the armors go up in +ac (+1,+2,+3,etc.) they get darker and cooler looking.\n\n-Respawn script, just like d2. you die, respawn in Rogue Encampment, lose equipped items, run back to your corpse, initiate dialogie, collect items :)\n\n-all npcs wander, no stagnant boring npcs or monsters standing still\n\n-Neverending persistent stash, the script has been tested with 350 pages of stash filled and it took 2 seconds to load\n\n-Vendors that scale with the pc as it goes along the quest line, for instance once you do the rescue cain quest, akara opens up a newer, higher level shop with items i've customized myself. Once you complete the horadric malus, charsi opens up a newer higher level shop, i'm planning to continue this through the acts.\n\n-CUSTOMIZED Commche's Random loot system, Link\nincludes \nMonster Corpse System (Blackfield's) \n- Corpses generate a pool of blood \n- Corpses clean themselves up after a set amount of time \n- After looting or if a corpse expires, bones are left\n- Raisable corpses \n\nLoot Generator \n- All loot types are generated: weapons, armor, jewellery, potions, scrolls, rods/staves, misc wearables (boots, cloaks etc) \n- Loot is color coded and named based on the quality of the item \n- The quality of the loot is determined by the level of the creature using a quality range system \n- Wearable loot is generated with a variety of different names \n- Chance for socketed, worn and broken items \n- Chance for extra powerful item (1 in 5000 is default) \n\nWORKING ON THE SOCKETING OF ITEMS because i have a town portal scroll script in effect on the onused script box which is the box used by the socketing system.\n\n-CEP 2.3 Installed, as well as the hakpak for the d2 music. THE ONLY HAKPAK NEEDED.\n\n-FULLY FUNCTIONAL Waypoint system. Once you walk onto the portal platform, a blue shaft of light spawns in the middle of the platform, onused starts a conversation that, based on the other waypoints activated, displays options on where you want to go. Even has a nifty unsummon effect when you teleport. :)\n\n-Fully functional (although still being tweaked) town portal system with similar graphic to the d2 tp..including scrolls of tp! onused, spawns a blue portal next to you..once you go through it stores info on where you are, destroys the original portal and spawns a new portal in town. once you go through THAT portal, it teleports you to the stored point, destroying the newly spawned portal ;)\n\nMUCH MUCH more.

ROUGHLY\nAct 1- Level 1-12\nAct 2 Level 12-20\nAct 3 Level 20-28\nAct 4 Level 28-35\nAct 5 Level 35-40, the Ancients giving you your last level\n\nIf I end up incorporating act 6 and 7, they will give you 40-50, and 50-60 respectively.\n\nHope to have some of you looking forward to play, and test my module! :)\n","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3133":{"Title":"[Modern NWN] Want to help but don't know how?

Seeing that becoming master at both dark arts and arts of the war was impossible without being immortal (or at least, not as humans), the Void Order made a pact with an ancient lich that once ruled an ancient civilization.\nTrading souls of many beings and letting the lich become the new ruler of the order, the order acolytes receive its blessing of the undead, a long forgotten magic that could make a simple spell caster to increase its skills at combat, or make an warrior to become able to not only understand the undead, but also to command it and use the powerful spells of necromancy.\nThe most powerful part of the gift, however, was that the acolytes that start the training could share a link with the lich, allowing them to not age and not dies (by conventional means) as long the lich itself existed. The lich however also told them that this link would not be given to anyone who decided to do the training, but only for those who were worth it.\nFor those who had the will and the power to survive the training were given the title of Dread Knights, the warriors of darkness and decay that has the strength of a warrior with the powers of a necromancer, and maybe even beyond.\nAfter completing the intense training (which don�t last less than 200 years), the Dread Knight becomes a beacon of evil, and its allowed to live the citadel of the order and bring down the lich wrath to any divine worshipper.\nFor those who want to become Dread Knights must be aware that this path twist the knight�s mind making it almost insane, seeing undead as sacred (only the ones who has intelligence) and divine beings such as Aasimars and paladins as weak creatures that run away the true meaning of life, the death.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements: Lawful Evil only. Dread Knights must follow his training with total discipline in order to survive and receive the Lich bless.\nWorship the Deity Velsharoon.\n (As a Role Playing requirements, one must have at least 315 years old in order to show it has already complete the basics of the Dread Knight training).\nHit Die: d10\nBase Attack Bonus: High.\nHigh Saves: Fortitude and Will.\nWeapon Proficiency: All weapons. Thanks to the long training, Dread Knights can use any simple, martial and exotic weapons (many Dread Knights uses bastard swords since they like to see themselves as Anti-Paladins, or scythes in order to become like the Grim Reaper itself).\nArmor Proficiency: All Armors (Light, Medium and Heavy) and all Shields (Except Tower Shields). The Lich hates tower shields for their size and their looks, for they was once used as a symbol of hope and protection on his former life.\nSkill Points: 5 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.\nClass skills: Bluff, Concentration, Intimidate, Lore, Parry, Spellcraft, Tumble and Use Magic Device.\nSpells: Dread Knights can channel negative energy like necromancers, being able to cast all necromantic spells and few evocation spells. They cast spells like an arcane spell caster and therefore are susceptible to spell failure, although this failure is slowly reduce due his training. In order to cast a spell, the Dread Knight must have a score in Intelligence of 10+ the spell level. Dread Knights don�t need to prepare his spells in advance but know only a limited number of spells per time. The DC for Dread Knight�s spells are based on his Strength Score. Spell Bonus are based on Intelligence score. Dread knights cannot use metamagic feats\nBattle Caster: Dread Knights begins its career able to cast spells while wearing Light Armor without chance of suffering spell failure. As he keeps training the ways of the Void Order, at level 5 he is able to cast spells while wearing medium armor and on level 11 they can use heavy armor without suffering from spell failure.\nUndead Animal Companion: The Dread Knight receives an undead animal companion as a gift for the Void order. He can summon an undead wolf once per day as a druid 3 levels lower. The undead wolf has the same attributes as the regular druid wolf, but it has the same immunities as the undead and a 20% vulnerability to fire and light.\nBonus Feat: at level 4, and at every 4 levels thereafter (8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28) the Dread Knight can choose a combat oriented feat, just like Fighters do. They still need to meet all requirements of the feat in order to select it.\nUndead Immunities: As the Dread Knight progress at its training, the link between him and the Lich becomes strong, therefore given him undead powers. At level 3 gains immunity to poisons. At level 6, immunity to diseases. At level 9 the Dread Knight gains immunity the sleep. At level 12, he gains immunity to paralyze effects. At level 15, the Dread Knight receives immunity to Attribute Reduction effects. At level 18, immunity at Level Drain, and finally, at level 23, the Dread Knight Receives immunity at Death Magic effects as if he have Death Ward.\nBonus Save: The bound with the Lich gives the Dread Knight a great help to resist against mind-effect spells. He receives a +1 on his Will Saves at level 5 and at every 5 levels thereafter ( with a total of +6 at level 30).\nDread Knight Strength: Few know how Dread Knights achieve such intelligence without trading their �wealth� in the process. The Strength of the Dread Knight comes as a gift of the Lich. At level 6 and every level thereafter, the Dread Knight receive the Great Strength feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites (ending at level 30 with Great Strength V)\nUndead Resilience: The skin of the Dread Knight is harder than a bone, and therefore he receives a 1/- damage reduction every 3 levels.\nUnholy Blade: At level 5 and as long the Dread Knight is using a bastard sword or a scythe, he deals a 1d2 damage bonus of unholy energy. This damage increases to 1d6 at level 10 and 1d8 at level 15.\nVulnerability: There is a trade off by linking itself with the Lich. Starting at level 3, the Dread Knights becomes 10% vulnerable to fire and 15% to light.\nAura of fear: Starting at level 4, the Dread Knight emits an unholy aura making any enemy in 15 feet to receive -2 on its saving throws. Enemy undead can make a Will Save throw against DC 10+ ½ Dread Knight class level+ ½ Dread Knight Intelligence, if it fails, it becomes feared as if he was target of Turn Undead feat.\nGuardian of the Lich: Once the Dread Knight reaches level 20, the link between him and the Lich alert the Lich that the Dread Knight becomes so powerful that he received the honor of becoming its guardian. The Dread Knight receives Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy feat even if it does not meet the requirements. His eyes also start to glow red.\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3162":{"Title":"Weapon Animations?","Author":"crossfirex","Submitted":20120520,"Updated":20120527,"Category":"Other","Short Description":"Weapon Animation Replacer","Type":"Improvement","Description":"I was just wondering if maybe there was already something like this out there.

Basically you choose a direction (probably a speed later) and you navigate through coordinates x & y.\nThere will be a lot (i hope) of random events, most of them repeteable with variant through your travel (attacked by aliens, other ships encounters (friendly or not), missions etc).\nThat's basically the default system.\n\nThe important thing here is coordinates. Some coordinates will correspond to a place, for example a planet, a station, a ghost spaceship... Whatever you want. Every quests variables and position will be stored with the campaign database mecanism. Why ? Well, simple. You will be able to play, normally, with saving and loading games. But, you will be able to export your character and put a new version of the module whithout losing your progress and what you have already done.\nNot that i intend to update it a lot. I think i will finish my whole system, add a sort of default story with some quests and let it like this.\nBut it also mean that, by following an \"how-to\" that i will add, everybody will be able to add content to this mod. Not by updating and changing everything, no, but by adding things at some coordinates, made an export of the area and scripts and whatever added, and now players will juste have to import these \"mods\" in the main mod, and continue playing the game with constant new elements.\n\nThe default system will include :\n- CEP\n- D20Modern\n- Ninjaweasel animation\nSo everybody should have a lot of content to work with.\n\nNot that i'm that lazy, but i've always find it frustating to finish a great mod like ADwR or Gladiatrix and to know that the next part may take month or even years to be playable. By making a community module like this, this mod will have the potential to stay alive, and frequently updated. And people like me, who haven't time or courage to make a great and long module, may probably make a small module with only one or two hour of gameplay, without the feeling of emptyness.\n\nI hope it will interest some people, but even if you play it only to try the system or make the default campaign, it's good enough if the fun is there.\n\nYou will discover it soon, i hope. I intend to release a very alpha demo with only the navigation system and a few event in some weeks...","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3164":{"Title":"Tileset","Author":"Nevercallmebyname","Submitted":20120616,"Updated":20120622,"Category":"Module","Short Description":"Tileset tutorial didn't help.

For example, 0-level spells (arcane \"cantrips\" and divine \"orisons\") are not expended when cast; barbarians gain special abilities while raging; cleric domains gain a second power at 4th, 6th or 8th level; druids who do not select an animal companion are instead entitled to one nature or element based domain; the paladin's lay on hands can cure various conditions; the rogue's sneak attack works against constructs, plants and undead; and wizards gain abilities based on their specialization (including the universal \"specialization\").\nThe cleric's turn or rebuke undead is replaced with the ability to channel positive or negative energy, which is used to heal creatures or harm living or undead creatures depending on your alignment. This reduces the need for spontaneous casting of heal or inflict spells, effectively giving clerics more spells per day. Turn and command undead are still available through feats. Bards, paladins and rangers also get more spells per day.\nEvery character gains something at every level beyond base attack bonus and save progressions. For example, fighters get bravery and armor and weapon training, and rogues get \"talents\", like the 3.5 special rogue abilities but even before 10th level.\nSome classes have entirely new features. For example the ranger has favored terrains, and the sorcerer chooses a bloodline that grants bonus spells, feats, and abilities.\nClasses that get a creature cohort (such as a familiar or animal companion) can choose something else instead; for example druids can choose a nature-themed cleric domain, and wizards can have a focus object that allows them to cast a spell spontaneously.\nMost classes have a \"capstone ability\" at 20th level to encourage players to reach 20th level in one class, for example bards can kill with their performance and paladins' smite evil can act like a banishment spell.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3168":{"Title":"NWNCX Weapon FX Gmax Automation","Author":"merricksdad","Submitted":20121227,"Updated":20121228,"Category":"Script","Short Description":"Gmax script to allow quick creation of thousands of VFX for weapons...","Type":"Models","Description":"Ok, so I have been working on this gmax script that allows you to put a bunch of prefab emitters and emitter groups on a longsword.

Anyway...\n\nThree Base Phenotypes:\n\n\nInstead of having phenos for normal and \"fat\" characters, I'd like separately animated phenotypes for each of the physical scores of Dex, Con and Str. \n\nThe high Dex pheno appears thinner, with stringy muscles. It hunches down when running, and during combat. It appears read for action nearly all the time. Its \n\nmovements are quick and short reaching. Some attack animations should be whirls. Double weapon strikes should be very fluid.\n\nThe high Str pheno appears overly stocky, with angular muscle features. It stands overconfident, rarely appearing ready in combat. Its movements are slower and \n\noverreaching. Attacks may seem clunky, but should showcase the underlying power this character relies on.\n\nThe high Con pheno appears somewhere in between, with a thick frame and even muscle tone. It appears ready for combat only in its combat ready animations. Its \n\nmovements are normal and confident. This phenotype should appear closest to the base bioware character animation set.\n\n\nComparing Armor Parts and Full Body Skins:\n\n\nSome users complain of the blockiness that is NWN 1. PC's and most monsters suffer from what has been called a \"pinochio\" look, due to a few factors:\n\n1) Body parts are made of separate models. Sometimes body part segments are even multiple models that jut through each other.\n\n2) Lightning in the Aurora Engine is pretty bad if you just use the default lightning/fog schemes in the toolset.\n\n3) There is no good way to incorporate bump mapping into NWN 1, so characters need to be properly fitted with specular values, which are generallly horrible. Not to \n\nmention the horrid metallic sheen on anything even slightly metal.\n\nTo remedy this issue, many custom content developers have attempted rebuilds of PC type models, including wrapping characters and monsters in skins. But this technique \n\nalso comes with a few issues:\n\n1) Out of Sync Issues: Skin animation may separate from body part animation when multiple animations are stacked within a given time range. Take for instance a skinned \n\nPC body using a separate helmet model. During the two weapon attack animation, the head and weapons may fly away from the robed body. Why? This issue is due to the \n\nanimation transtime parameter and how it is interpreted inside the engine. The skin model will more accurately wrap itself to the two animations and better calculate \n\nthe transtime, whereas the individual body parts appear to almost ignore transtime entirely, jerking from position to position.\n\n2) Limited Skinning Potential: Skin animation appears to be impossible at most body nodes, leaving only the Robe, Cloak, Wings and Tail nodes available for skinning \n\n(and to an extent, weapons). Furthermore, the robe is the only skinnable choice that seems to properly take PLT texturing. The Robe is also the only skinnable choice \n\nthat can display the entire player animation set. Like robes, cloaks can use PLT texturing, making use of skin and hair colors selected by the player, however, cloaks \n\nfollow different rules then the robe layer. Unlike robes and cloaks, wing and tail models are not race specific, so there is a total of 255 tail and wing nodes each to \n\nshare over all races and classes.\n\n3) Incompatible Skins and Body Nodes: Some skins will make use of non-standard nodes, such as shoulder fixes, extra limbs, etc (I know mine do!). Other skins may wrap \n\njoint nodes in a way that bending of the joint is less blocky looking, and preventing inappropriate squishing or folding. Due to these differences from the standard \n\nwooden block model, more body part nodes are less likely to be compatible with the robe model, due to the fact that the skin now bends where the wood-block dummy was \n\nrigid. Basically, the potential exists for a lot of body parts that *cannot* be used with a lot of robes. This would make body part models only useful as accessories \n\nto a set of similar robes, where the part is made in such a way to not pass through or be partially clipped by the robe.\n\n\nSo what to do?\n\nGiven issue number 3 in the previous section, I think the robe as a base model is still something that can, and should, be done, BUT with a few other major changes:\n\n1) Body part nodes are accessories to the base robe, yes, but lets move the nodes and make them accessories at more useful (and less bendy) locations. For example, if \n\nplate armor is built into the robe, then it is no longer needed at the torso location. Instead, rename torso_g in the animation model to something else, but still \n\nusable by the skin model. The same could be done with all body part nodes. Basically take all the XXX_g nodes and rename them something else (maybe just drop the _g), \n\nand while skinning, use the non _g bone names.\n\n2) With robes being the base model, that leaves only 255 body combinations for the race. I personally feel quality outweights quantity any day. Make the skins as high \n\nin quality as can be, within reason and engine limitations. You still have full PLT support for robes, so you can make a lot of robes go a long way with variations on \n\ncolor.\n\n3) Since robes are the base, cloaks could stay unchanged. However, I'm not a big cloak fan. I suggest making cloaks a skinned accessory layer which can fit over the \n\nrobes. Will all cloaks be compatible with all robes? Probably not, and why should they?\n\n4) Due to the fact that heads can separate from skinned body parts during certain animations, I suggest putting the head right on the skin or into another skinned \n\nnode. By doing that, a model could also contain a lot more facial animation built right into various sequences. Does this fix helmets? No. So maybe a helmet could be \n\nincorporated into certain skins too. Where does that leave the head node? Well, as with other body geometry nodes, maybe the head should be used for accessories \n\nelsewhere. (don't forget its racial scaling ability in appearance.2da)\n\n\nNon-traditional body nodes and accessories:\n\n1) Hair: Since robes would be the base model, you might choose to make non-helmeted skins have no hair. This would open the door for you to use another body node as a \n\nhair piece node. Take for instance that torso_g node we don't actually need for skins, but which is already built into the engine for displaying a body part. Construct \n\nfor the torso node a set of 255 hair models. In body robes where the hair would not be seen, such as by a built-in helmet or hood, simply set in partsrobe.2da to not \n\nshow the torso model. Warning, the hair could still slide off the skin model during those times when multiple animations are playing at once (such as multiple attacks \n\nin a round, double weapon attacks, two-weapon attacks, and transitions between emotes played too fast back to back). Likewise, a beard node could be fabricated from \n\nsay the neck body geometry node. But why stop at using those now-unused body geometry nodes...\n\n2) Cloak-node accessories: Because cloak node items are an overlay to body geometry, there is potential for the cloak node to be an accessory part that spans multiple \n\nbody part nodes. For instance cloaks could be make to wrap the thigh-shin-foot region to create a form-fitting thigh-high boot. Alternately, this boot could already be \n\nincorporated into the base robe, but then again, so could the cloak. \n\n3) Something else to think about is the fact that robes and cloaks *should* flow seemlessly together at all times since they work basically the same way, as overlays \n\nto the base body geometry, and with the same animation cycles. Because of that potential, the cloak node could be used to create visual overlays to gear already part \n\nof the robe model. Take for instance, there is no good way to incorporate tatoos into a robe-node skin without burning a lot of robe slots to give the player some \n\nvariation. Instead use the cloak node to overlay tatoos 1-2 pixels away from the robe-node body. Alternately, use the cloak node to overlay symbols or other icons on \n\nrobe-based cloaks, necklaces, or other gear.\n\n4) Another good use of the cloak node would be a helmet that does not shift away from the body during unique animation cycles. When used with the head-on-the-robe \n\nidea, open faced helms would be super simple. Additionally, the PC would no longer be plagued by the helmet scale entry in appearance 2da. You could then use the \n\nscaleable node for something else, although I have no suggestions on that topic at this time.\n\n\nThe concept of less heads per race:\n\nThe idea that there could be less heads per race may at first be a drawback. However, many of today's games focus less on faces and more on quality flashy armor parts \n\n(or rather skins and more skins). Yes, its true that many other MMOs coming out right now do have highly customizable faces, even moreso than The Sims 2, but, in \n\nreality, how often are NWN 1 players more concerned about the physical appearance of their character's face over the appearance of their gear? I'm thinking the face is \n\nfar less important than gear, at least that's how I play. If viewing a character's face was more important than other gameplay at some point, I would seriously \n\nconsider changing to another appearance type for closeups, such as an appearance type with very detailed face textures and almost nothing for detail in other regions. \n\nThat might be great for making fan movies and cutscenes.\n\nGiven the above possibilities, including head being part of the robe model, and helmets being a range of cloak models, it may also seem reasonable that heads could all \n\nbe constructed in the cloak model. Like with any change, the drawbacks are the same, but this method would give the character more faces to play with. Setting aside a \n\nrange of cloak model for semi-generic faces and then keeping the rest as helmets (concealing or openfaced) would still give the player a large quantity of helmets and \n\nfaces, as well as potential openfaced helmets.\n\nThe concept of less customizable armor:\n\nThe standard armor set has a huge possibility of armor sets that can be made. Each armor region has a limit of about 250 parts, and there being 15 or so armor regions, \n\nnot including cloak and robes. Thats an ungodly quantity of combinations. But, if you are using the bioware standard parts, you have a bunch of color-changed \n\nduplicates, AC-up/down duplicates, and a lot of unused slots per armor region. You also have a lot of stuff in one part that doesn't ever get used with another slot \n\nbecause part A is made to go with part B and no other. Custom content rarely makes a part that goes with everything else either. So, you are coming no where near the \n\nbillions of possible combinations. I don't personally think anybody but long-running PW's are probably even near maxing out the slots per body node. So why not reduce \n\nthe maximum limit of armor appearances to just 256?\n\nBy using the robe model as a character's base, the goal is to create a skin for everything from full nudity all the way up to exotic epic plate armor. \nHow many armor varieties do we need then? Well lets calculate some simple numbers:\n\n1) Full Nude\n2) Non-magical Undies\n\n3-5) Some basic non-armor garb. Lets say common, fancy and rich. That should cover PC's needs to disguise themselves as something they are not, so they can fit in with \n\nreal people occasionally.\n6-8) Non-armor cleric vestments, such as robes. Lets say 3 appearances is a good base for just about everything. Being PC gear, lets just say there is an appearance \n\nfor each tier of PC-hood (in 4th ed terms), so, Heroic, Paragon and Epic.\n9-11) Non-armor psion/sorcerer vestments\n12-14) Non-armor wizard robes\n15-17) Non-armor battle harnesses for barbarians and such\n\nOk, lets take a look at armor types. I'd do the same for every armor and armor subtype: 3 appearances:\nPadded Leather, Leather, Studded Leather, Hide, Light Chain, Heavy Chain, Light Scale, Heavy Scale, Breastplate, Half-Plate, Full-Plate, Banded, Ring, Splint.\nThats like what, 14 more types; 42 more slots used; running total 59.\n\nSo, what else could you possibly want? Well, racial armors and maybe some exotics, right, like stuff from the planes. So lets do 3 more for each:\nElven Chain, Elf racial clothes, Dwarf, Drow, Gnome, Orc, Viking, Arab, Pirate, Demonic, and Celestial.\nThats 11 more types; 33 more slots used; running total 92. Well crap, we haven't even made it to the half-way point yet.\n\n3 tiers of each armor not enough for you? How many do you need? Lets go up to 4. So not including nudies and underwear, lets take our total, and multiply by 4/3 to \n\ngive 4 tiers of everything (92-2 x 4/3). Thats still only 120, STILL not half way!\n\nThat leaves a ton of room for stuff like chicken costumes, grotesque unsightly demonic nudes (why are those two often found together?), and maybe even some party \n\nattire for various regional campaigns. Toss in some more exotics like elven leaf armor or an owlbear fur coat. Wear a demon's skin as a suit like some epic Hannibal \n\nLecter, or toss in a modron costume just for some fun.\n\nYou see, its really no drawback at all!\n\nYou can follow or even join this project by visiting the related Bioware Social Forums Project Page.\n\nThe project pages include job postings, better descriptions, and a tally of where the project is.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]}}
