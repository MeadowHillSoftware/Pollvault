The function BeamTrace() can make a beam effect's endpoint move from one vector position to another. 2.The chain VFX function. This makes the VFX selected play several times in a row between two vector positions. Looks like the pulses of color in the SoU:Chapter1 dungeon beneath the gnoll caves. 3. The cage function creates a cage over a creature, that has several options for creation. 4. The keymaker. Just place the instance of the key in a spot on the map, and the wand will create a key that fits the lock it is used on. 5. Relative teleporting script.

It supports diagonal transitions, full edge matching, even for areas of different dimensions, and allows you to use a specific load screen for the transition. It uses a single generic script file that can be used unmodified for all transitions of this type in a module. Connections are defined using transition triggers with a simple, intuitive naming convention for the trigger tags.

So it's still powerful, esp. with bosses, but not overly so. EXAMPLE: Perfectly healthy creature with 800 hit points gets harmed - it loses 400 HPS! Same creature gets beat up a bit and has 600 hit-points (out of a maximum 800) - he gets harmed and he loses 200 hps.

If the party average level is over 7 greater than the creature's CR, you will get no XP from this script, look at my comments and simply uncomment out 1 line (detailed in the script) and comment out another to give the minimum XP regardless of CR. In my games we do not reward for easy encounters, but you may do things differently. Hope you like it. New in 1.2 and 1.3: Added a few minor tweaks, 2 more validity checks, more comments in ver1.2 An optional parameter to divide the XP given by a specific integer so you can cut down on the XP if you have many encounters. Compatible with older versions, the new parameter is optional! Thanks Cage for the suggestion for this modifier.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"544":{"Title":"Equip Wands","Author":"The Great Slayer of Gelatinous Cubes","Submitted":20030418,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Unique Items","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"This is a simple little set of things in an .erf, included: are 3 scripts that store what a charcter is wearing as local objects. an item activate script to merge with whatever you have there already. a re-equip script that re-equips the propper equipment stored as local objects based on a naming convention 3 wands that re-equip the 3 included sets a wand that opens a conversation that stores their current equipment into one of three sets a conversation (for the above wand) This was made as my means of filling the idea to be able to keep any two peices of equipment in a quickslot.

The purpose of this script is to prevent players from being 'Rest Maniacs' - that is, resting after each and every battle. Note that I used the Ettercap model, for lack of a better one.

This works well but can encourage loot farming in the wrong areas. The problem is that you can usually haul the same value of treasure in a dungeon full of goblins as you can in one full of dragons with virtually no risk. This can encourage competing with PC's that belong in the goblin dungeon because it is still challenging to them. This is bad and the other PC's have a right to complain about you stealing their loot, killing their spawns and triggering higher level CR encounters than what would normally occur (thus endangering their lives). What can we do about this? Put level limits on the chests so a 15th level character in a dungeon designed for 5th level only finds items appropriate for that level. With chest level limits, a 15th level character would probably not waste their time in low level dungeons because the reward/time ratio is too low.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"638":{"Title":"Generic AI Targeting","Author":"BioWare","Submitted":20020708,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Creature AI","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Targeting","Includes":"None","Description":"Commands that you can use in generic AI scripting","Rating":1,"Awards":[]},"640":{"Title":"Generic Doorguard/Chestguard","Author":"Lord Mephisto","Submitted":20030702,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Creature Related","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Stealing","Includes":"None","Description":"This is a generic doorguard/chestguard script which does not require any setting of tags, variables or similar nuisances.

The inventory of the shop servers only as indication of what items the script should generate for that kind of shop.

Additionally, there is a single charge on each rune, so anyone can cast the spell. but only once, then it's gone, where as spellcasters have the ability to cast it as many times needed (Only once per day) This is my solution to the rune stone problems, i'm using it in an upcoming mod that i'm making, the original design is based on the PHB spell components by Trickster there is a demo included, showing how they work, just ask the sales man for his rune store..","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1398":{"Title":"Rust Monster & Troll Improved Scripts","Author":"El Magnifico Uno & Courtly","Submitted":20030206,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Creature Related","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - General","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"An improvement on the Rust Monster and Troll Regeneration scripts.

I do, so I made a trigger that alerts a near by NPC to tell the PC to leave the area and if the PC doesn't leave, the NPC attacks the PC. Also included is a script that can be added to a placeable (such as a chest, crate, etc). If the PC uses (ie: opens) the object the NPC will automatically attack the PC. Why an automatic attack rather than a warning system like the trigger uses? Well once the object is opened the PC can (and most likely will) take anything before the NPC warns the PC. If you want a warning system for a placeable, just put the placeable in a place with a SnoopTrigger. The cool part is that the NPC has a listen and spot check to see if he/she can detect the presence of the PC. So if the PC is using stealth and is a rogue (or has good Move Silently/Hide/etc skill values), the NPC doesn't realize that the PC is sneaking right passed them.","Rating":8.5,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"1501":{"Title":"Snotworts Spreading Fire script","Author":"Carl Boothroyd 'Snotwort'","Submitted":20030128,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Area","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"None","Description":"This is a set of scripts that are based on WaltGs damaging fire script.

While the pads are visible, a modder can use invisible placeables as long as the tag names match. (Again, more like Bard's Tale).

Currently, it allows for respawning the contents of multiple chests for those encounters with the fat loot. Usage Attach the script named 'enc_chestrespawn' to the OnExhausted event of the event that the chest is to be tied to. Then, change your chest's tag to be whatever the tag of the encounter is, with '_Chest' appended to the end. Note that any encounters using this should have a unique tag. Copyright 2002, Clifford A.

Range of the spell is 50 metres. The spell is multiplayer-friendly and coded to deal with overlapping timestops. Duration of the spell is d4+1 rounds, but if you want you can change this easily by modifying one line. CEP is required, because it includes the required version of vfx_persistant.2da. No additional haks are required. I believe this would work with normal HotU without CEP as well, although I cannot confirm it. There are options in 'nw_s0_timestop' for modifying two parameters: 1) Whether or not the caster will become invisible for the spell's duration. The downside of this is that the caster cannot target or right click on themselves. 2) Creating a frozen-in-time image of the caster where they were when the spell was cast. If this option is used you will need an inaccessible area with a waypoint named 'HiddenArea' in it. An area such as this is included in the ERF.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2126":{"Title":"Unbreakable Throne and Single Sittables","Author":"Killa","Submitted":20040711,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Placeable Item","Expansions":"NWN-1.62","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Furniture (Subtype - Other)","Includes":"None","Description":"I got tired of writing a script for each throne so I decided to make one you can use on all.

The creatures themselves and the module will handle the horde movement so that if PCs are around they can encounter the horde but if none are, the module will continue to move the horde to the destination point, area by area.

All are 'line-by-line' commented and 'newbie-friendly.' The most basic of the three allows a module creator the ability to transition between areas of different sizes/shapes in a logical manner. The creator must follow a simple area tagging system and create a separate script for each transition type (i.e. a 9x5 area to a 7x4 would be named TGW_AT_9X5_7X4 and be used only on edges where this applies).

Just extract the contents into your override folder and you're good to go. Like all overrides, this will break patching, but you won't need this fix with 1.65 anyway, since Bio's aware of the AI bug.

Vuldrick's Lycanthropy (somewhat based on the NoData's Lycanthropy System)\n\nApplying these scripts to your module will allow you to place a\nnew custom Werewolf. This new Werewolf will infect PCs with a Curse\nof Lycanthropy, changing them into Werewolves on the days of the full moon!\n\nThis code sets several variables on PCs to account for phases of the moon,\nand the state of the curse. Also included is a tool given to the PCs that allow \nthem to attempt to control their shape when in their normal state and trying to \nassume the form of the Werewolf or a wolf. The character will recieve this tool \nonly upon waking up from the change, and succeeding a WIS check (DC 15). This \ntool cannot be dropped or destroyed, and is removed upon the curing of the curse.\n\nAs per the 3rd Ed. DnD Monter Manual: \"Any voluntary change into...hybrid form\nimmediately and permanently adjusts the PCs alignment to that of the...lycanthrope.\"\n\nThere are several spell changes included in the scripts that allow the HEAL, \nMASS HEAL, REMOVE CURSE, and REMOVE DISEASE spells to have a chance to cure \nthe infected PC. If you have made any previous changes to these spells, you MAY \nneed to reapply your changes after having imported these scripts.\n\n\nCURING LYCANTHROPY: There are several ways to cure the Curse.\n\n1. Belladonna: Eating or having someone with the HEAL SKILL use, Belladonna on \nthe infected PC within ONE DAY of the infection, will allow a chance for the infected \nPC to shake off the curse. HOWEVER, whether on not the curse is removed, Belladonna \nis HIGHLY Poisonous and may have adverse effects on the patient. As per the PHB, \nonly the first use of belladonna has a chance to cure the disease and all further \nattempts will be futile.\n\n2. Remove Disease or Heal: If a Cleric of at least 12th level casts either of these \nspells on the infected PC within 3 DAYS of the infection, then the curse will be lifted.\n\n3. Remove Curse: If a Cleric casts this spell on the infected PC DURING the days of \nthe full moon, then there is a chance the curse will be lifted.\n\n*** ALL DCs are set to that established in the monster manual section on lycanthropy! ***\n\nIt is adviseable to remove any armor you are wearing before the transformation!\nMost types of armor (unless Magical) will give way to the pressure of the change ... shattering before the PC's very eyes!\n\nAlso included is a way for module builders to add silver weapons to their game that \ncan be used to strike the Werewolf without a +1 or better weapon. Just make sure \nthe silver weapon has the word \"Silver\" or \"SIL\" in it's TAG and it's ready to go!\nI have included a silver weapon of each base weapon type for you in the items erf.\n\n\n\n2. Vuldrick's Vampire PCs (somewhat based on Ercan's Vampire Subrace)\n\nPCs can now become full fledged vampires with the proper abilities as per 3rd Edition DnD rules.\nCheck out the demo module by making your PC's subrace \"Vampire\" ...\n\nI included a spells 2da file that allows many negative energy spells to be used on self \nso vampires can heal themselves appropriately. Place this in your override folder \nor use it to make a hak file.\n\n\n\n3. Vampire Crypt - Vampire NPCs\n\nThe crypt, if you want to use it, has all parts included in the erfs. Just check the \ndemo module to see how I implemented it, it is fairly straightforward. \n\nThe cool thing about these vampire is that they use their coffin to revive after being\nbeaten into gas form. If you smash the coffin they pop back out at half HPs simulating\na partial regen/rest on the vampires part. IF you fail to smash the coffin, they respawn\nin eight in-game hours at full health.\n\n\n\n4. Ravenous Undead by Lupin III ... just seach for Lupin's scripts for the readme. I\ndid not change that much at all. Very fun little system that lets ravenous undead feast\non fallen NPC corpses to heal themselves ... gross stuff :)\n\nThe Ravenous Undead are in the erf and once you have them in your module, just go to the custom \nundead and look for the \"Ravenous\" varieties. You must have NPCs that leave drop corpses \nfor the undead to \"feast\" upon them.\n\n\n\n5. Random NPC spawning system\n\nThe spawning system by Gaermish is simple to implement. Just add, or merge, the population \nscript into the area onenter event and the depopulator script to the area onexit event for \neach area in which you wish to use it. You can modify the code to give a different maximum \nnumber of NPCs in each area, default is a max of 50 commoners. To add more NPCs, use the \nnaming convention already used and just adjust the script.\n\n\n\n\nA seperate download is available for each system in case you want to use them individually. Simply \nview my offerings on nwvault.com to see the other scripts sets available.","Rating":9.7,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"2506":{"Title":"One Way Doors v3.2","Author":"bkngt","Submitted":20050224,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"NWN-1.65","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"OneWayDoors These doors are for within an area and are NOT transition doors.

I also thank all the folks that have voted for the ORS to make it a Hall of Fame script/ruleset! Cheers!\n\nSecondly, this is a realistic....common sense.....real world implementation for our fantasy adventures. For folks who want the more fantastical approach to gaming�.play somewhere that has this type of feature or build it yourself��you will not find that in here.\n \nWith saying the prior this can be as Hard-Core as you wish�.or maybe you only want a little realism. You can configure this as much as you like to get the final affect you desire. Need to tweak it on the way? You can�.easily. Most of the time you will need to open ONE script to configure your module.\n \nRealism is the guiding principle behind the systems integrated here. Within the gaming system dynamics I have stayed as close to realism as possible. Also with that I have removed tedious realism to keep with the adventuring flavor. Remember that other people populate your worlds too and they make much of what Adventurers need to create great things.\n \nPHB and HCR:\nThis is not HCR but can be used as a great replacement for those looking for realistic adventuring. There are Player�s Handbook (PHB) configurations in here but this is not a PHB rendition. The NWN game engine is really not a PHB/DnD game as those systems were developed on Pen and Paper which is a very different game than online or video gaming. So we need something a little different to adapt to NWN or this excellent video game. This is what is behind the ORSv5.\n \nThere is also a TON of stuff in here that is READY to play with! There is NOTHING for you to do except Configure the Module Configuration Script and Test to see if it is close to what you wish! HCR2 is a nice system but is kind of complicated to get installed and going. This puppy is simple��very simple. Remember�..everything about the ORSv5 is and HAS been tested ONLINE in a True Dedicated server!\n \nThe ORSv5 ruleset will load a 40MB Module in about 12 Seconds! That is amazing. What does 12 Seconds do to the Builder/Server? Well�.for one thing�.you can realize that the scripts have been designed so that they run ONLY when needed! The Module Loads up and configures itself but everything else is dynamically generated. This means that pings server/cpu wide are kept to singular instances instead of applied stacks! This means more Database Reliability and cleaner Server services for your players.\n \nIn the end�..whether the ORSv5 is used as a Persistent Online World or as a Campaign Setting spanned across several modules�..now you have One Location to do everything you wish to do. No Installations�.just Build it! Of course if you wish to Install something into the ORSv5 the process has always been very easy and very little complication.\n \nSo give the ORSv5 a try and you will be hooked. Also please give some credit in your modules. It is a small thing but an Honored thing�..a nice Vote on the NWVault is also very much appreciated!\n \nThank You for Downloading and trying the ORSv5. I hope your modules are as fun to play as mine.\n \nThe Tutorial Module has many of the cool things you can try out as well as it is 100% set up and functioning. Please have a look at the ORSv5 Builders Guide (PDF) for detailed information.....there is a lot there.\n \nCheers and Regards!\n \nOlander\n\n\nORS�..The Systems\n \nEach System below is Detailed in it�s own Section.\n\nORS Olander�s Realistic Base Systems (Included in the ORS as a Base)\n- Olander�s Realistic Torches and Lanterns System\n- Olander�s Realistic Combat Trainers \n- Olander�s Auto Closing and Locking Doors\n- Olander�s Allegiance and Subraces Engine **Shayan Subrace Engine no longer will work with ORSv5\n- Olander's Library System\n- Olander�s Persistent Time (ORSv5 New Features)\n- Olander�s Area Clocks with Gonging\n- Olander�s Time Syncing for High Stressed Modules\n- Olander's Automatic Street Lights (ORSv5 New Features)\n- Olander�s Automatic Ambient Placeable Lighting (ORSv5 New Features)\n- Olander�s Map Exploration (ORSv5 New Features)\n- Olander�s Jumping and Climbing (ORSv5 New Features)\n- Olander�s Capture the Flag (CTF)\n- Olander�s King of the Hill (KoH)\n- Olander�s Transportation and Teleporting (ORSv5 New Features)\n- Olander�s Ambient Trigger ORSv5 New Features) (\n- Olander�s Click Less Area Transitions (ORSv5 New Features)\n- DMFI 1.08 Ready to Go!!

Have a realistic crafting \n\nsystem, but the components materialize from thin air? Using a system that makes GP into inventory items?\n\nI have the system for you!\n\nNon-overwriting of other items!\nNo Scripting knowledge needed!\nWorks with all your existing merchants!\nHak includes 250+ original item icons in less than 2 megs!\nPlug-n-Play NPC Appraiser- No muss, no fuss!\nInherent variability- one Shiny Stone may become any of ten different final Gems!\nFULL descriptions, including gem lore, pricing and mythology converted for FR!\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDepending on how your module is set up, this system can do a lot of things for you-\n\nProvide an alternative to huge piles of gold in chests\nSupplement a GP-as-Items system\nAdd realism to a crafting system\nMake Appraise an actually meaningful skill\nRe-insert uncertainty in treasure values\n\n\nOr, you could just use the item blueprints, in which case you have 126 final gem items with fully detailed descriptions, \naccurate relative pricing, gorgeous icons (if I do say so myself), plus a set of 42 Magical Gems with powers chosen \n\nto match the folklore of that particular gem.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe coolness of the icons is apparent by looking at the screeshot- either you like them or you don't. The coolness of \n\nthe system is a bit harder to catch in a screenshot. Descriptions are a bit better, but you really should look for \n\nyourself if this sounds at all interesting:\n\nGems transform in front of your eyes as you Appraise them; one pile of generic gems can get sorted out into several piles \n\nas you determine more about them. The NPC Appraiser can either charge you or keep the gem, so you don't pay more than the \n\ngem is worth, but you lose income over time, so there's encouragement to learn Appraise.\n\nThis is a completely self-contained system; other than two small \"hooks\" into the OnAcquire and OnUnacquire scripts, and \n\na need for a tag-based onActivate script (x2 and the old community standard both work), this system has no interaction \n\nwith outside scripts. You don't need any scripting knowledge whatsoever to use this system. Simply attach the Event \n\nscripts and drop the items into your Mod, and it will work, including the fact that every store in the module will \n\nAppraise gems automatically.\n\nIf you want to use the NPC appraiser, you simply make two objects (an appraiser and a table), attach a store and the \n\nconversation in their appropriate places, and go!\n\nThe kits are now balanced for a 20-level game, but have easy-to-adjust bonuses if you would like them to be more or less \n\neffective. Skill checks are displayed so that the player can see how well they are doing in their appraisal attempts.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSeriously, it's a kinesthetic kind of thing- a lot more elegant in action than it is to describe, and, I think, a lot \n\ncooler.\n\nSound good? Give it a try!\n\nCome on, it's less than a meg to download!

If your rebuking level is high enough, you have a chance\n of dominating them and having them under your control for a duration.\n\n - Turning is now a Supernatural effect\n Made turning a Supernatural effect so the turning effects can not be dispelled.\n\n - Turning now skips creatures that were already turned/rebuked\n Turned creatures will not count against your turning count.\n\n - Turn undead checks both the creatures racial type and class\n If a creature was created and have an incorrectly set race but\n have levels like Undead, it will be considered undead.\n\n - Turned creatures have their movement speed decreased by half\n If you're attacking something with a fear effect in NWN, the game\n tends to move you close to the target, then stop you, then move the creature away,\n so you never actually get to ATTACK it even if you're hasted and it's a zombie.\n Even worse is that creatures that are knocked down magically spring up and run away,\n and it's just SO annoying.\n\n - Cleric, Paladin, Blackguard and Champion of Torm levels now stack\n The turning level isn't decided on the class with the highest level.\n Cleric levels now stack with Blackguard and Paladin levels but Paladin\n and Blackguard levels don't stack with each other.\n\n - Turn undead Knocks over valid creatures\n This fixes a bug where sometimes turned/Rebuked undead still attack.\n The other reason behind this is when you rebuke/turn undead. You\n release a tremendous amount of (un)holy energy. This energy causing those\n affected to be knocked off their feet.\n\n - Added checks to see if a creature is turnable\n HasTurnedEffect is called to check if the creature can be turned.\n It checks to see if the creature is already turned, paralized,\n petrified, frightened, stunned or dominated. This way creatures\n who can't or shouldn't be turned won't use up HD turn counts.\n\n - Added Associate Checking\n I added a check so rebuke undead will not try to add associates\n under your command, instead they will be paralized. Also when turning\n a summoned creature, it will show an unsummon special effect.\n\n - Magical beasts are now turnable/rebukable\n If you have the magic domain, you can turn/rebuke magical beasts now.\n\n - Several domains and feats affect your turn modifier\n GetTurnModifier is used to get the modifier for the current target. The bigger the\n modifier the better the chance you will turn the target and the longer the effects will last.\n The modifier also effects the damage you do to constructs if you have the destruction domain.\n This modifier take into account several domains that don't really get much use and also\n focuses in necromancy adds to the modifier against undead. Also various domains and things\n may subtract from your modifier.\n *Evil Domain: If you try to turn a creature with an good alignment and you\n have the evil domain power, you gain a +1 modifier. Unless you also have the\n good domain, -1 is subtracted from the modifier versus evil.\n *Good Domain: If you try to turn a creature with a evil alignment and you\n have the good domain power, you gain a +1 modifier. Unless you also have the\n good domain, -1 is subtracted from the modifier versus good.\n *Sun Domain: You gain a +1 modifier to all checks.\n *Knowledge Domain: You gain a modifier that is dependant on your wisdom bonus.\n You gain one third of your wisdom bonus as a modifier. If your wisdom bonus is\n equal to or smaller then 0, then the current wisdom bonus - 2 is subtracted\n from the modifier.\n *Strength Domain: Checks your strength bonus versus the targets strength bonus.\n If your strength bonus is 2 or more times higher, then you gain +1 to the modifier.\n If your strength is higher, then you gain +1 to the modifer.\n If the targets strength is 2 or more times higher, then you lose -1 from the modifier.\n If the targets strength is higher, then you lose -1 from the modifer.\n These stack for a total of +2 or -2 to your modifier.\n *Water/Fire/Air/Earth Domain: You gain +1 to your modifier versus the corresponding\n elemental of the domain you have.\n *Trickery Domain: The trickery can have a negative and positive effect to our modifier,\n Theres a 50% chance it will have a positive effect and a 50% it will have a negative effect.\n If you also have the luck domain, it becomes 80% for a positive effect and 20% for a negative\n effect. If its positive, you gain 1-3 to your modifier. If its negative, you lose 1-3 from\n your modifier. Also if it rolls a lucky 7 or a unluck 13, the results of the modifier are\n doubled. So if you had a negative effect of -3 and roll an unlucky 13, it will become -6.\n The same goes for the positive modifier with rolling a 7,\n *Death Domain: You gain a +1 modifier versus undead.\n Focuses in necromancy will add to your modifier against those considered undead.\n *Spell Focus Necromancy: +2\n *Greater Spell Focus Necromancy: +2\n *Epic Spell Focus Necromancy: +2\n The bonuses from the focuses stack for a total of +6 if you have all three.\n The higher the modifier the easier it is to turn the creature. Also the\n higher the modifier, the longer the rebuke/turn effects will last on the target.\n The current duration is (nClassLevel + 5)*nTimeModifier rounds.\n nClassLevel is the number of levels of cleric, paladin/blackguard and CoT you have.\n nTimeModifier defaults to 1, so the duration is normal, but if your modifier is greater\n then 1, the nTimeModifier is set to the current modifier.\n The modifier is added to the dice roll when damaging constructs if you have the destruction\n domain, so the damage is now d3(nTurnLevel)+nHDModifier.\n\n - War Domain damages Turned/Rebuked creatures\n If you have the War Domain and successfuly turn or rebuke a creature, they will take a small\n ammount of Divine damage. This doesn't stack with the magic damage that is already done to\n constructs. The damage done is d6(3)+nHDModifier.\n\n - Travel Domain Extends Turning Range\n Originally the turning range is 20m (65ft) but if you have the Travel Doamin this changes to\n 25m (80ft), adding another 5m tot he original distance. This way you can turn creatures which\n are farther away then usual.\n\n - Added support for local integers on creatures\n Added support for several local integers on the creatures so builders have greater control how a\n creature is turned or if they are immune to turning.\n TurnImmunity: If TurnImmunity is set to True, the creature can not be turned.\n IsTurnable: Is IsTurnable is set to true, the creatue can be turned no matter what it might be.\n IsUndead: If IsUndead is set, the creature will be treated as an undead when turned.\n IsVermin: If IsVermin is set, the creature will be treated as a vermin when turned.\n IsElemental: If IsElemental is set, the creature will be treated as an elemenal when turned.\n IsConstruct: If IsConstruct is set, the creature will be treated as a construct when turned.\n IsOutsider: If IsOutsider is set, the creature will be treated as an outsider when turned.\n IsMagicalBeast: If IsMagicalBeast is set, the creature will be treated as a magical beast when turned.\n TurnHDOverride: If TurnHDOverride is set to anything greater then 0, the value set for TurnHDOverride\n will override the creatures current HD and be used instead of their default one.\n The new value will still be affected by the turn modifier as well.\n You can specify is a creature can be turned with IsTurnable, if so, the creature can be turned like everything\n else but it won't have a race type like undead or so on unless it has thatr ace already. The creature will have HD\n equal to their HitDice plus their turn resistance. Also anyone with Turn Undead will be able to turn them without\n any special feats or skills.\n If you want to make a creature be set as turnable but give it a race or use a race check, use the more precise ones\n such as IsOutsider. The creature will then be considered an outsider while being turned, using the outsider HD\n calculations and also check if the player can turn outsiders.\n **Note: IsTurnable overrides the other settings except for TurnImmunity. So if you have IsTurnable and IsOutsider, the\n creature can still be turned even if the player can't turn outsiders.\n\n - Added function GetRacialCheck which now handles the racial checkings\n This function compares the given race against the targets race. This checks against the targets\n racial type, if they have the racial class or if they have the racial local interget override set.\n If true, it returns True, if False, it returns false. The first parameter is the race to check for\n such as RACIAL_TYPE_UNDEAD. The second parameter is optional and specifies the target. The default\n is OBJECT_SELF which is the PC using the script.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"2647":{"Title":"Commche's Supernatural Subrace System v2.0","Author":"Commche","Submitted":20050605,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Subraces","Expansions":"HOTU-1.65","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Combat","Description":"** Commche's Supernatural Subrace System **\n\n* Progressive abilities\n* NEW Subrace Forms - changed forms with added abilities\n* Customized spells (special subrace powers)\n* Subrace Talismans that grow in power\n* Realistic form conditions\n* Progressive changes (eg.wererat-werecat-werewolf)\n\nSubraces include:\n\nHorodrim\nDragoon\nDrow\nNight Elf\nWood Elf\nDuergar\nSilver Dwarf\nPixie\nSuccubus\nVampire (male or female appearance supported)\nLycanthrope\n\n* Vampires burn and die in sunlight\n* Lycanthropes can only change at night\n* Special abilities only work in changed form\n* Humerous effects for trying to use abilities in non-changed form\n* Nightfall and the break of dawn are signified by birds chirping or owls hooting.\n* Low CPU overhead\n\nFor full details on subrace abilities and forms, see the HTML document in the download.\n\n\n** Demo now Included **","Rating":9.05,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"2648":{"Title":"Trace Debugging Technique","Author":"Frank Perez","Submitted":20050605,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Other","Description":"The Trace Debugging Technique is a simple way to trace through the function calls of your modules.

Continuous and Respawn\nEveryone may loot your chests, and they respawn after a set delay.\n\nNot only can you choose between any of these 4 methods, but different chests in the same module can work on different values, so you might make the gems in an old pile of bones only spawn treasure once, but the chests in a bandit's hideout frequently get re-filled as the thugs bring in more loot.\n\nThis system is only intended to manage respawning and makes no changes to what exactly gets spawned. By default, it uses the HOTU treasure generation scripts, but it is incredibly easy to plug in any custom treasure script you've got in its place!\n\nThis system is designed for PWs by using Timestamps, or integers that it uses to figure out what time it is, instead of DelayCommands.

All you have to do is paint your triggers, rename their tag entries, and put your custom messages into the script.\n\nDepending on the tag you use for the trigger (see the \"readme\" section at the top of the script, itself), the script will know whether you want the trigger to fire whenever someone enters the trigger area, only once for each PC that enters the area, or only once for the first PC that enters the area (once per game).\n\nBut the true beauty of this script is that, because it uses a case switch, if you're familiar with coding, you can add your own code to each trigger. So you can make them skill checks, ability checks, custom traps, whatever you want. I used a 3 digit index system, which will support up to 999 triggers (more than enough for any module I can think of).

You can now penaltize large parties and / or parties with huge level \n\ndifferences (Default values can easily be set in RFMI_const.nss)\n- Added a DM Message for the TakeAllItems-function and removed the old from the RFMI. \n- Fixed strange DM Messages within RP_INT (I was apperently sleeping when I made RFMI)\n- Fixed the RP_GP and RP_XP functions (Error: Same as above)\n- Fixed bug that would allow players to turn in items even when cap was reached\n- Added RFMI_Const.nss file to allow easy modification of default RFMI values for your module and make you keep your settings through new \n\nupdates. \n- Turned RewardForMultipleItems into a Wrapper for three functions (TakeAllItems + RFMI_RewardProcentage + RP_INT), thus you now have \n\nmore options with the functions induvidually, should you need this. \n\n\nRFMI Features.\n\n-Get and Set Variable Scripts for all RFMIs Variables. (In case you need a variable set by the RFMI-script or wish to change one)\n\n- RFMI cannot be cheated by the \"Drop Bug\", which can be used some times to avoid losing the item you were supposed to lose, nor can the \n\nCap be exceeded by ANY PartyMember, since it updates each members Variable.\n\n- RFMI allows a \"DisplayToAllDMs\"-Function, if the DMs wants to be notified, when someone uses the RFMI to turn in items. By default this has \n\nto be ticked on for ALL(!) RFMI-Scripts that DMs want to be notified about. (Suggested for capless Quests) NOTE: DMs will be notified ANYTIME the \n\nscript is triggered, telling them who turned the items in (incl Affected Party Members), what item (Item tag), how many (This may differ from Party \n\nMember to Party Members as some reach the cap before others).\n\n- Allows Persistant Storages via items (Stored on items players cannot get rid off) and Campaign Databases (Used in the NwN Chapters). \n\n Please Remember that you need to do a \"Build Module - Recompile Script\" before the patch takes effect. \n\nRFMI has been tested on Elronds Server (Module: Unrest in Arda). \n\nComments, feedback, Ideas, Bugs and issues are welcome, just mail DM_MoonShadow@hotmail.com\n\nEnjoy your Script\n\n~Moon\n\n NB: The script was made with SoU and HotU version 1.66.

This or a later version of the DMG should be the primary resource for describing environmental fatigue. The Environmental Fatigue Engine tries to simulate the model described in the DMG as closely as possible but in some areas the Aurora toolset just didn't provide the functionality needed to do this. Also, the description of environmental fatigue is a little sparse in the DMG, and hence, I've had to take liberties and use creative license in certain areas. For example, no description is given for when a body falls to excessive temperatures and is then resurected a little while later in the same area. My assumption was that they got all their life back with no damage (subdual or otherwise) but the body was still hot so the DC was not reset. \n\nBasically, when you are in an excessively hot or cold place, you have to do a fortitude saving throw every hour (or 10 minutes in insanely hot or cold places). The first hour you are there the DC is 15. Every successive throw adds 1 to that DC. When you fail a fortitude saving throw due to environmental fatigue, you must take subdual damage. If you're in a cold place, you take 1D6 of subdual damage. If you are in a hot place you take 1D4 subdual damage. \n\nPlease note that subdual damage in the Environmental Fatigue engine doesn't work exactly like subdual damage described in the DMG. The main difference is this damage is local to the environmental fatigue scripts. In other words, if you take subdual damage from a punch (if we were to add a subdual damage system), the system as setup presently will not include this when tallying your subdual damage from the environment. \n\nWhen you take subdual damage due to environmental fatigue you then get fatigue. There is no fatigue effect in NWN (as far as I know) so I simulate it by reducing the PC's dexterity and strength by 2. This is how fatigue due to the elements is supposed to affect you according to the DMG. \n\nYou can find relief from the elements by going near a waypoint that is properly tagged with ENFT_RELIEF_SPOT, having an environmental protection spell cast on you (this will also protect you from future fatigue form the elements for the duration of the spell), or coming to a temperate area (an area not flagged for the Environmental Fatigue engine). Relief will take away all the subdual damage, the fatigue effect if any, and reset your fortitude saving throw to 15. I should note that immunity to hot or cold will protect you from taking damage (subdual damage or otherwise) although your DC will still rise. \n\nIf you don't find relief and your subdual damage exceeds your HP, you fall unconscious. Unconscious means you can't move and are lying on the ground (well, hopefully). If you fall unconscious due to the cold, your skin also turns a nice shade of blue (the ice skin visual effect is applied to you). When you fall unconscious you roll as usual using an ever increasing DC and take damage with the same dice. However, now instead of subdual damage you take real heat or cold damage. You continue to take this damage until you find relief or die. \n\nWhen you die, your subdual damage returns to zero and you are no longer unconscious. This isn't much conselation anymore but is important should you be raised.","Rating":9,"Awards":[]},"2720":{"Title":"Diablo 2 Style Death System","Author":"Lord Delekhan","Submitted":20050722,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"HOTU-1.66","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Description":"\n\n\n\n\nDiablo 2 Style Death System\n\nFor those unfamiliar the system works as follows:\nUpon respawning a corpse is created where the player died.\nAll equipted items on the player are removed and placed on the corpse.\nThe items on this corpse can only be accessed by the player who's corpse it is, others will simply be told who the corpse belongs to.\n\nIf the player dies again while attempting to recover their lost items all worn items are added to the corpse, and the location of the corpse is moved to the most recient respawn spot.\nIf after respawning the player exits the module and then returns the corpse is moved to town for safe recovery of their equipment.\nWhen the player activates their corpse they are asked if they wish their items back, upon agreeing all items will be moved automatically from the corpse to their inventory and the corpse will be destroyed.\n\nThe erf includes three generic module event handler scripts\n\nld_mod_def_rspwn (OnPlayerRespawn)\n\nThis script includes the default game penalty code and a generic bindpoint check\n\nld_mod_def_enter (OnCLientEnter)\nld_mod_def_exit (OnClientLeave)\nThese scripts can be used as is or the required code from them can be copied to your existing event handler scripts.\n\nLord Delekhan\n\n\n\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2721":{"Title":"Persistent World Clock System","Author":"Lord Delekhan","Submitted":20050723,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Time Devices","Expansions":"HOTU-1.66","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Time","Description":"\nPersistent World Clock System\n\n\n\n\nThis system maintains the current date and time through server reboots.

When we were starting our persistent world,\nwe both decided we should use a spawn/despawn system.\n\nWe tried NESS (Neshke�s Extendable Spawning System) and it was very cool\nand full of very useful tools but after a while, we decided to create ou\nown system... Why ?\n\nWe got the feeling the server was a bit laggy since we installed NESS.\nAs the NESS system is specifically using HeartBeat, it grabs a lot of\nressources. We wanted something else... and so, we decided to create\nsomething using both onEnter and onExit events.\n\nAfter a while, things changed because we needed to spawn/despawn NPCs at\nday/night. And this is definitely not possible doing good without using\nthe HeartBeat. That's why we created another part of the system which is\ncalled \"GDSL\". What is that ?\n\nGDSL means \"Gestionnaire de spawn LOCK\" which is \"LOCK Spawn manager\"\nin french. Basically, it is an invisible placeable with a script on its\nheartbeat and it manages the Day/Night (de)spawns the way NESS was doing\nit. The only difference with NESS is that when the despawn occurs \n(10 minutes after the area is empty), the GDSL Manager placeable is also\ndestroyed too and so, there is no more HeartBeat running inside the \narea... unless somebody enters the area again ! ;-)\n\nWith LOCK, you can spawn creatures/placeables/items. Also, you can spawn \na creature and apply some tasks to it after the spawn. \nFor example: You can force it to sit down on the nearest chair. You can\nconfigure it to play an emote (like sitting on the floor, looking far away,\nhaving spasm, ...). You can give it a new tag (useful when you need to\nspawn many identical creatures inside an area and give them different \npatrols) ... With GDSL, you can do the same than LOCK but the spawn will\noccur only at Day/Night, depending on what you ask it to do. You can also \nlock/unlock doors (Example: shops) depending on the Day/Night status... :-)\n\nWant to see it in action ? Download and have a look to the demo module ! ;-)\n\nUpdates:\n\n1.02.\n- Updated \"lock_inc\" to avoid a bug which was preventing creatures from respawning when a PC left an area and go back there.

For those unfamiliar with DAR, it is the (once) widely popular subrace system, whose defining characteristic is that it allows \"real\", stackable stat changes, and is easily expandable. This, naturally, requires you to turn off Enforce Legal Characters in NWServer. It was, in my opinion, far and away the best subrace system out there, and really the only useful option for uber action servers (since you hit the +12 bonus cap sooner or later, other system's \"bonuses\" became a net wash). Since it's release, its glory has somewhat diminished, since 1.65 disallowed players from having spell-like abilities, and 1.66 took away the natural armor class field from PCs. Still, I felt it represented the best option for my PW. There was, however, a problem - it only worked if 1) you purged your servervault, or 2) you batchedited all the characters in your servervault. Neither of those was a palatable option for me at the time, so with copious amounts of help from dragonsong, letoscript's creator, I rewrote DAR to work with letoscript's new language, Unicorn. This offers the following advantages:\n1) Because it uses the brand-new \"Find Newest Bic\" function, it is no longer necessary to purge or batch edit your servervault to get DAR to work. \n2) You are able to use a more fully developed and supported version of letoscript, and one whose syntax is far more simple than that of it's predecessor.\n\nWhat was changed:\n1) Most of the changes occured in dar_func and dar_leto_func, the scripts containing the letoscript. I commented out the old Phoenix, and replaced it with Unicorn, the new letoscript syntax. All letoscript functions are working at 100% (my goal for this release). You can add feats, stats, etc, and you can implement character self-deletion for your players.\n2) I altered the dar_list script. I commented out abilities that no longer function as a result of bioware updates, I altered the race statistics to my liking, and I disabled many subraces. These are all changes which are easy to configure to your taste.\nNOTE: One important change here was the change to subrace names. Some players had already chosen subrace names like \"drow\" in my PW, and this caused problems for the system, so I selected name syntaxes that no one would've used, like \"Elf - Drow\".\n3) I upgraded the SNE (supernatural effect) section. Although this is not directly related to letoscript, the sne's in dar were extremely buggy, dispelling when they shouldn't and disappearing on death. I added Extraordinary Effect to them so they would not dispell. As for them disappearing on death, you will have to reapply the effects in your ressurection/raise dead/ etc scripts if you want to have them act as realistic subrace characteristsics (you could simply delete them from dar_list instead, and be done with them). These abilities were not the reason I wanted DAR for my world, so I didn't place too much emphasis on them.\n4) NOTE: I altered the way character self-deletion works, out of necessity. The old method was to have a character drink a potion. He would then be booted and his file deleted. This worked fine in empty-server playtests, but in the PW the wrong characters were getting deleted. This is because the new system uses FindNewestBic, and attempts to save the character just before deleting him to ensure that that bic is the newest. On the server, the save command wasn't completing in time, so I got rid of the potions and put the deletion functionality in a conversation, where the character is saved in step one and deleted several steps later at the conclusion. A sample mod is included with the erf to demonstrate.\n\n5) NOTE: You will have to change the servervault path in the GetBicPath function, rather than changing it in dar_config. Just changing it in dar_config will not work as I overwrote the variable in the function in a test and forgot to replace it. It'll be fixed when I release a more polished version.\n\nI hope that this conversion proves useful, but I do not intend to support it extensively. Experienced NWNX-Leto users should have little trrouble making the switch. For those lacking such experiece, I would direct you first to the forums for the respective programs:\nNWNX: http://www.nwnx.org/phpBB2/\nLetoscript: http://weathersong.infopop.cc/eve/ubb.x\n\nAgain, a great portion of the credit here is due to Demux, DAR's creator, and dragonsong, Letoscript's creator.

No ERF's are available at this time! Sorry!\n\nThis bit of scripting will allow you to give your Pc's the ability to charge while in combat, just like in PNP. I felt this was a very nifty action missing from NWN, as a fighter can make great use of it durring the opening rounds of any combat, and with a few tweaks, makes for a very interesting perk to melee fighting. \n\nIn PnP, there is an action called \"charge.\" Essentialy this is the PC getting a running start, and making ONE attack on the target, sacrificing all other attacks or actions that round. Maybe not so useful once you start getting bonus attacks, but there are some nifty bonuses worth consideration to go along with this action. I forget the exact PnP rules, but they go something like this:\n\nThe Pc, or NPC who performs the Charge action, gains +2 to attack (a called target), moves at double normal speed, and suffers -2 to AC.\n\nI have modified this rule a tad to better fit NWN, but stay as true as possible to the intent of the rule in PnP. \n\nAll the basic modifiers can be altered if you know anything at all about scripting, but the current version does the following:\n\n(Only works with a melee weapon, or hand to hand)\n9.99 meters or closer (including Z axis distance): The Pc can't charge, not enough room.\n10.0 meters or more in distance the Pc gains +2 to attack and Damage, and suffers -3 to AC (instead of 2, this was done due to some limitations which benefit the PC, as well as to balance the damage bonus a bit... better.). \n20 meters or more in distance, and the PC gains all the above bonuses and modifiers, and also has a chance to \"tackle\" an enemy knocking them down for 3 seconds. The DC is currently set at 15, and is resisted with a reflex saving throw. I am tempted to try and make the DC modifiable, as it might need to be for higher level action. But this felt pretty good so far. I am tempted however to have the knockdown DC match a base of 13+ the attackers STR bonus... Or something similar, whatever I do, it needs to feel right. This would be easy to add into the code presented here if you wish to try it yourself. \n\nAfter making an attack (wether you hit or miss), all the bonuses (except damage bonus, due to some strange bug I can't figure out), are removed thanks to the special function in the targets on physically attacked script. After 12 seconds ALL effects (both good and bad) are removed regardless (even if you abort the attack). It IS possible to cheat a tiny bit and try this on distant enemy, abort and go for the nearer one, so I decided to make this something you can't spam either... this action can only be used once every 18 seconds, of course you can set this to any value you wish.\n\nIt \"Would\" be possible to implement special considerationfor pole arms, but this would be very very easy to exploit. One could simply charge with the polearm,and switch weapons to something more potent before the attack, and gain all kinds of advantages, they shouldn't have. \n\nFor ridable horses it would be pretty simply really to add in special added bonuses for charging, to simulate the added power... If i do eventually try it, I would likely remove the AC penalty when mounted (because your moving so fast), and leave the attack, damage, and knockdown untouched or slighty boosted (+1 to attack/damage, and or knockdown DC raised to 20). \n\nFor instructions on installing this script into your games, just read the user comments below for the basic explaination. \n\nBefore I explain how to implement this, please understand I'm a bit embarrassed about how sloppy this code is. I haven't scripted in a while, and it's late, so I cut corners using Lilac souls generator, and using quick and dirty techniques. However the scripts arn't very large, and are pretty well commented. Obviously a total newb to scripting won't make much sense of this, but I'll do my best... I will however assume you know at least enough to understand what I'm talking about:\n\nFirst make a unique power item, I like using miscelaneos small, as this isn't an \"ITEM\" per say, but a special ability. \n\nMake sure it has the special property: Cast spell: Activate Item long Range. \nUnique power works also, but you can't use it from any range suitable for a charge. \n\nSomehow link the activation script (shown above), in your activated item event. This is probably best done with tag based scripting to basically do this:\n\nobject oItem = GetItemActivated();\nstring sScript = GetTag(oItem);\n\nExecuteScript(GetItemActivator(), sScript);\n\nThen name your script the same as the tag of the item to be used. \n\nOr something to this effect. Of course you could still do this the old way and simply place the first script shown above, right into your item activation event. \n\nThe next bit is the tricky part for the real novices, as you will need to modify your default AI scripting for creatures. This really isn't that difficult, and is best done for ALL creatures, but could of course be something you insert simply into a new script. \n\nTo start, open up: nw_c2_default5\n\nJust above the void main, place the function script (as shown above). Save/Compile to be safe... If it doesn't compile, you probably missed something, or put it in the wrong place etc. \n\nNext, just below the void main(), just add the example function call as shown above also. \n\nNow drop a melee weapon into a test area, plop in the activatable item and make the NPC something that doesn't move or anything, and is immortal just to be able to try it multiple times (assuming you got everything right and it works). \n\nNow fire up NWN, grab the items and go for it. Note Ranged weapons will not function with this system (nor should they), and you need to be at least 10.0 Meters from the target for the bonuses to apply, and 20 meters or more away to get the bonuses and Knockdown/tackle together. \n\nLEt me know what you think, and again forgive me if this is sloppy.

As soon as the player buys the given object, the script creates a new copy in shop. And so until all amount sold+given subjects available in shop will be created. That is the script simply stores in local variables only properties of a object and amount of the given objects.\nPreservation of properties of a object and amount of copies is made in string by converting numerical values of type, effects, etc. of object in one string for each unical object.\nThat the given system began to work you should establish local variable 'SPECIAL_SHOP_LIST' on merchant type 'int' with value '1'.\n\nPart of a script (function of converting of a object in string [SpecSL_GetProperties] and back [SpecSL_SetProperties]) can be used for creation of banks of objects of players and guilds.\n\nThe script successfully keeps all properties except for ITEM_PROPERTY_ON_MONSTER_HIT (glitch NWN), but hardly it is required to you in shop. :)\n\nIn function SpecSL_UpdateList () for definition of the size of a stack of ammunition 2DA-tables are used, that can slow down work of a script. At desire you can replace a capture of values of 2DA-tables with constants. :)\n\nTo use scripts x2_mod_def_aqu.nss and x2_mod_def_unaqu.nss it is completely not necessary. Simply add in the end used on yours shard scripts OnItemAcquire and OnItemUnAcquire call SpecSL_Buy(); and SpecSL_Sell(); accordingly.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2797":{"Title":"Scripting Library: Coloured Text","Author":"psychospaz","Submitted":20050927,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Save this as script 'include_colour' in your module and then put the line '#include \"include_colour\"' at the top of the script you want to use it in.\n\nUsing the StringRGB or StringColour functions you can transform normal strings into coloured string will full colour customization.

Fixes include such things as making it work, adding every error check I could think of, making it work for multiplayer and PW modules and even leaving it open for scripter/builders to use this script for player owned chests (though that would require customization, but hey I got a template for ya, take a look at it).\n\nA demo module is included this time, check it out.\n\nOk it's 6:28am and i have work in 7 hours, screw this, i'm pasting the readme file. Good Night, I hope you enjoy..\n\nAnd once again, feel free to use this in your mods if you wish.

There is a value associated with each of the\n8 actions you can perform on the chest which will aggrivate the owner. Once the points\nreach 5, they attack.\n\nThe actions and points are as follows:\n- Open the container (5) \n- Trigger the container's trap (3)\n- Disarm the container's trap (3)\n- Unlock the container (3)\n- Damage the container (2)\n- Take an item from the container (5)\n- Destroy the container (5)\n- Physically Attack the Container (Hit/Miss/No Damage) (1)\n\n\nNow...\nThat is just the most base usage of these scripts.\n\n\nOPTIONAL FEATURES:\n-Multiple owners\n-Set Random Treasure scripts\n-Custom point values (listed above)\n-Make the owner execute a custom reaction script (template included)\n\n\nMultiple Owners:\nIf you want the script to have multiple owners then instead of setting a variable\non the container called \"owner\", you set variables called \"owner1\", \"owner2\", etc..\neach with the unique tag of an owner/guard for the container.\n\nRandom Treasure:\nSet a variable on the container called \"treasure_script\", the value of this variable\nshould be the name of the random treasure script you want this container to use (you\ncan make your own or use the bioware ones, such as \"nw_o2_generalhig\").\n\nCustom Point Values:\nAdd these variables (as ints) upon the container, if they are set to 0 the script will\nuse the default values.\n- ttc_open\n- ttc_disarm\n- tc_damage\n- ttc_destroy\n- ttc_unlock\n- ttc_taken\n- ttc_trap\n- ttc_attack\n\n\nOther Notes:\nAnother additional feature is that if the owner/guard(s) do not see the PC, but\nthe PC triggers the trap, attacks the container or destroys it, the npc(s)\nwill look in their direction (duh they can hear that).\n\nInstallation:\n-Open toolset\n-File>Import, The erf in this zip.\n-create a container placeable\n-rightclick it, properties>scripts>load script set, the ini file in this zip\n-you will have to manually load the two scripts for traps under the trap tag\n-set a variable on the container called owner (or owner1, owner2, owner3, etc.. for\n containers with multiple guards) and make it's value the owner/guard's Tag.\n\n -OR- use the template container (Under Custom>Containers & Switches)\n\n\n ps: I bet there's a bunch of scripts that already do this, but i didn't bother looking,\n just fet like making one and sharing, enjoy.","Rating":9.63,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"2800":{"Title":"Summoned Animated Rapiers!","Author":"Hugie","Submitted":20051002,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Creature Related","Expansions":"CEP-1.52 Requires Community Expansion Project","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"None","Description":"The four bandits stalk closer and closer to the frantic mage, who slowly backs away from them...he is out of spells, and all he has left is the rusty dagger tucked into his belt.

This one runs off of 2DA file treasure tables that you create. It allows you to link simpler treasure tables together to form more complex treasure tables and generate loot drops based on these treasure tables. The KTG system is seamlessly compatible with all custom content you add to your module including the CEP.\n\nThe idea was to create a system that works conceptually very similar to the way the old PnP systems handled loot. With tables that allow for categories of loot to be combined into a list that can be selected from using a dice roll. You roll the dice and the table tells you 1-3 items from category A plus 1-4 items from category B. Then you roll on the category A & B tables to see what items you get. I wanted a system that allowed me to easily create loot tables that worked this way so I invented the KTG system. It is remarkably simple and surprisingly flexible.\n\nSee the User's Guide and Tutorial that accompanies this erf for instructions on how to use this package and the Readme file for installation instructions and an introductory overview of the KTG system.\n\nNote: The user's guide has a very poorly written statement about requiring only NWN original.

Instead of creating an onspawn script for each caster that I want prepped for combat with his defensive buffs up. I made this wand. You target the NPC you want to use it on, and pick the class and level of the caster. The target will then be buffed up and ready for combat. There is some random element involved so that if you hit several NPC's with the buff wand they wont all be buffed in exactly the same way. All spells are cast instantly, and all are Extended (to give you a little leeway as far as advanced buffing) Note that some of the spells are personal. Which means if you use this wand on a non caster to simulate that the NPC was buffed by an NPC caster, there may be some cheating involved as a fighter may have a few personal type buffs up. This wand does not verify that the target has access to the spell, and if he does have access, it does not remove that spell from his allotment. This is a totally cheesy DM tool for quick and dirty NPC buffing. This was created because I was creating onspawn scripts for any caster that want ready to go for battle. Which means I had to do a force rest if I wanted them unbuffed. and I had tons of scripts laying around. Now instead I dont use that script, I spawn my NPC, point the wand, pick his class and level and voila! Instantly buffed. The wand only goes to 18th level,and only handles wizards and clerics. I may add Druids and epic levels if there is enough interest (in my campaign druids are rare, noboby gets higher than 14th or so level) Other casters such as paladings, rangers, etc can be simulated by choosing a lower caster level. Eg. a 9th level paladin could be buffed as a 6th level cleric and it would be close to being correct.\n\nMogney\nwww.neverwinterconnections.com","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2855":{"Title":"UPDATED!

It requires NWNX and NWNX-Letoscript to be installed. Here's how I explain it to players ingame:\n\n================\nLegenday Levels are a mechanism by which your character continues to increase in power after level 40. They are NOT normal levels, and they only affect some of your character's attributes. They do not, for instance, affect casterlevel, spell penetration, or attack bonus. The ONLY affects that they have are listed below.\n\n---------\nSkills:\nCharacters gain their normal allotment of skill points for every legendary level, including a +1 bonus for humans and any intelligence bonuses. They spend them in the usual manner, with class skills costing one point and cross-class skills costing 2 points. Points may be saved from level to level, if desired.\n\nFeats:\nCharacters continue to gain a general feat every three levels, beginning at level 42, 3 levels after the last received at level 39. \n\nAbility Points:\nCharacters gain ability points at an accelerated rate during legendary levels, receiving an additional ability point every 2 levels, beginning at level 42.\n\nSaving Throws:\nCharacter saving throws increase during legendary levels, but at a slower pace than before. A character gains +1 to all saving throws every 4 levels, beginning at level 44.\n\nHit Points:\nCharacters automatically gain the maximum hitpoints for their class, including a bonus for the toughness feat and any constitution bonuses.\n---------\n\nYou'll notice that several of these attributes are dependant on the character's 'class'. Legendary levels are not considered to be standard levels in a standard class. You cannot, for instance, use them to fulfill level requirements for feats, spells, abilities, and so on; those must all be met by level 40. Legendary levels are, however, influenced by the character's 'Control Class'. It is the Control Class that determines how many hit points and skill points the character receives for Legendary Levels, and the availability of feats and skills. So how is the Control Class determined? Quite simply, it is the class in which the character has the most levels. If two class tie for having the most, the class the character took first will be the control class.\n\nSo what feats and skills will be available?\n\n-The Legendary Level system uses standard NWN rules to determine the availability of skills and feats, treating the character as if they were taking a level in that characters Control Class. Devastating Critical is still disabled, and a number of spell feats were added to the Palmaster's class feats to reflect their increased casting power (and the fact that their being missing appeared to be an oversight on Bioware's part). New feats and skills may become available later. All of the Class Feats for the character's Control Class will be available if the character meets the requirements, as will all of the General Feats if their requirements are met.\n\nHow much experience will these levels require?\n\n-Here is the experience chart:\n\n\nBASE_XP_LVL_40 = 780,000; \n+48,800=\nXP_REQ_LVL41 = 828,800; \n+60,900=\nXP_REQ_LVL42 = 889,700; \n+76,200=\nXP_REQ_LVL43 = 965,900; \n+95,200=\nXP_REQ_LVL44 = 1,061,100; \n+119,000=\nXP_REQ_LVL45 = 1,180,100; \n+148,800=\nXP_REQ_LVL46 = 1,328,900; \n+186,000=\nXP_REQ_LVL47 = 1,514,900; \n+232,500=\nXP_REQ_LVL48 = 1,747,400; \n+290,600=\nXP_REQ_LVL49 = 2,038,000; \n+363,200=\nXP_REQ_LVL50 = 2,401,200; \n+454,000=\nXP_REQ_LVL51 = 2,855,200; \n+567,500=\nXP_REQ_LVL52 = 3,422,700; \n+709,400=\nXP_REQ_LVL53 = 4,132,100; \n+886,800=\nXP_REQ_LVL54 = 5,018,900; \n+1,108,400=\nXP_REQ_LVL55 = 6,127,300; \n+1,385,600=\nXP_REQ_LVL56 = 7,512,900; \n+1,731,900=\nXP_REQ_LVL57 = 9,244,800; \n+2,164,900=\nXP_REQ_LVL58 = 11,409,700; \n+2,706,200=\nXP_REQ_LVL59 = 14,115,900; \n+3,382,700=\nXP_REQ_LVL60 = 17,498,600; \n\nThis chart reflects a 25% increase in the amount needed to advance from one level to the next.\n\nCan I delevel once I take a legendary level? \n\n-No. Make sure that your level 40 build is where you want it before you take any legedary levels. DMS CANNOT HELP YOU IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND LATER, OR IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE ON ONE OF YOUR LEGENDARY LEVELS. You will have the oportunity to start over at every step of the conversation, and will be asked to confirm your choices at the end as well. If you are unsure about your choices, ask someone first - preferably a dm.\n\nOk, I have the needed experience. What do I do?\n\n-Go through the portal in the Docks. The leveling conversation is self-explanatory.\n\nLegendary Level Chart (skills & hit point not listed since gained every level):\nLevel//Ability//Saving Throw//Feat\n41//N//N//N\n42//Y//N//Y\n43//N//N//N\n44//Y//Y//N\n45//N//N//Y\n46//Y//N//N\n47//N//N//N\n48//Y//Y//Y\n49//N//N//N\n50//Y//N//N\n51//N//N//Y\n52//Y//Y//N\n53//N//N//N\n54//Y//N//Y\n55//N//N//N\n56//Y//Y//N\n57//N//N//Y\n58//Y//N//N\n59//N//N//N\n60//Y//Y//Y\n================\n\nEASY INSTALL:\n\nThe system is designed to be easy to install, and is compatible with both old and new versions of Letoscript. Installation is describied in the readme accompanying the erf and demo module, and involves adding to 2 module event scripts, and inserting a placeable into the module with an onused script. That's it! The rest is handled by the system. \n\nHIGHLY FLEXIBLE:\n\nIt is also designed to be easily configurable, so that you can give more or fewer feats, abilities, and so forth. It also allows the user to set the experience needed to advance each level, and could be expanded to level 80 without much diffuculty if you think you can keep your module balanced (I didn't).\n\nNO MESS:\n\nAside from the permanent changes it makes to character files, the system doesn't have a lot of messy ints cluttering it. One persistant int tracks saved skill points, thats it. Level is recorded using the normally unused Lootable Field. This makes it mesh perfectly with the DARII Subrace System:\nLink\nThat system is NOT required to run it, however, and it will run just as easily with other subrace systems like Shayan's.\n\nUSEFUL FUNCTIONS:\n\nIn order to make the system work, I was forced to come up with a number of custom functions which I could find nowhere in the community. They may be of broader use to others, and are listed in the code display below.\n\nIf you want to see the system in action, please visit Higher Ground under Action, running the module Path of Ascension CEP Legends, at 64.237.35.112:5143. Post bug reports on the Vault page, or send them to highergrounddmteam@yahoo.com. Enjoy!\n\n\n#####Updated 8-29-06#####\n1) added the version number, 2.1, to signify a minor change had been made\n2) minor bugfix so that bard and sorcerer spell selection changes will work for those using the older versions of letoscript relying on Phoenix languge. If you are using the version of letoscript I provide on this page there is no reason to download this update.\n\n#####Updated 8-4-06#####\n1) Modified the scripts so that bards and sorcerers can now change their spell selections on levelup. \n2) Updated the test module to a two-area setup, demonstrating a simple way to restrict access to the leveling device to one character at a time, using the area onenter script, because two characters using the leveler at the same time causes the conversation to error.\n\n#####Updated 3-16-06#####\n1) Fixed a minor bug in the skill checking scripts. Skills were reading as artificially low bacause the penalties for shields were being subtracted from the base skill. To fix without reinstalling, change the constant in line 656 of hgll_func_inc from INVENTORY_SLOT_CHEST to INVENTORY_SLOT_LEFTHAND. Save, and do a full build to recompile the scripts. On the off chance that you've modified the include, that line is in the the function GetShieldPenalty, and looks like this before the constant switch:\nobject oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_CHEST, oPC);\n2) Removed the DARII code. It was a useful example of how to integrate mutliple systems that use Letoscript, but that seemed to be outweighed by the added 'junk' files, for most people.\n3) Added a self-extracting zip file with all the files needed to install NWNX and Letosctript, NWNX2andLetoscript24.exe.\n4) Added a detailed installation guide for the system including installation and setup of NWNX, Letoscript, and the Legendary Level system.\n\nApril 7th, 2006:\n\nI've created forums on my PW's forums for the HGLL System, because I check them several times a day, whereas I only check here once or twice a week.

For instance, how many Fire Beetle Bellies does one PC need? Or Skeleton Knuckles? sure, a use can be created in game for them, and that is a good, cool thing to do. But inevitably, PCs will generate \"trash\". Some servers have Trash Cans, and encourage the players to drop that kind of stuff in there, where it is destroyed. Cool, too. This script is simply another method for dealing with unwanted stuff like bone fragments, etc. It is taken from MUDs. The idea is that the PC can sacrifice such things to 'the gods above' or whatever, and get rid of the thing, and get a tiny reward for doing so. Right now, it gives 1 gp for each thing sacced. If anyone wanted to trim it further, they could keep a count stored on the PC, and when it reached 10, award a GP.\nFor demonstration purposes, a Sacrifice Stone is included. Just activate, target, and sacrifice. Of course, the script would be better implemented into an existing emote wand or other widget.\nSacrificing things: In order to use the sacrifice command, an item or object must have\nthe variable nCanSac set to 1 in its properties. In the Demo module, I have placed a couple of skeletons. One has the normal skeleton knuckle. The other has a copy, set to nCanSac. Kill them, and try the Sacrifice Stone on each to see the script work.\nThere are a few other things laying about that can be sacrificed too.\nI hope somebody can use this.\nJFK","Rating":9,"Awards":[]},"2872":{"Title":"Random People","Author":"S.

This version of Timestop is an attempt to make the spell PW friendly as well as remove the common exploit present in other Timestop changes. Most timestop scripts simply change the spell into an AOE paralyze/immobilize. This allows the exploit of the caster raising a dead player, leaving him/her free to buff and heal themselves. This spell affects the entire area of a caster, using cutscene paralyze, and constantly checks the area every second, reappling paralyze for the remainder of the spell. No noticable lag change in testing even with large groups of creatures as the spell checks only apply paralyze to creatures without it. The duration defaults at 1 + 1d4 rounds (3.5 edition rules), but can be changed by altering the constants. There is also the option to place a variable on an area, disabling the spell in that area (useful for social non pvp areas). Instructions are in the script. I had to remove the options to change the spell back and forth from affecting the whole area to an aoe radius as it was causing the spell to jam up. I will release another version of this script in AoE form for non scripters who want it.

I wanted a new type of random encounter trigger without it being linked to a random travelling trigger, so I created this. This is a random encounter script that you place on a trigger OnEnter. It is a spawn that has a random delay, spawns the creatures by the level of the player triggering them, and gives a different variable chance to trigger by night and day. For the person who actually hits the trigger (i.e., the point man), it also allows rangers a chance to notice tracks before the encounter shows up, a chance for druids to sense life forms by type before the encounter shows up, and paladins a chance to detect evil if the encounter is evil before it shows up. The area, HoldArea, is where the encounters spawn and wait for up to a minute before jumping to a point near the trigger. This delay gives characters a chance to sense what is coming and prepare an ambush. Right now, the defaults are a 15% chance of the encounter triggering during the day, a 25% chance at night, and rangers, druids, and paladins have a 10% chance per level of detecting what type of thing is coming before it gets there. The encounter spawns 15 feet away in a random direction, with a variable chance of a leader creature in charge of the encounter. In addition to different encounters for day and night, there are different encounters for levels 1-3, 4-5, 6-8, 9-12, and 13+. Right now, all these encounters are set to NWN and CEP default creatures. In my scenario, I've redone all the encounters for different types of terrain, but every creature has been modified not to have random treasure (except in some instances) etc. and I didn't want to include a giant file of creatures that are only different by a tiny script or weapon or two. \n\nThis comes with an area (HoldArea) and invisible object (also HoldArea) which are required for the script to work right. It spawns the creatures to the holding area, where they sit for 1-60 seconds before they actually spawn in near the trigger point. This delay allows rangers/druids/paladins a chance to detect them in advance and prepare defenses, an ambush, or to run away.

I was preparing to search the NW Vault for a system to utilize. Then in the midst of my preparations for hari-kari I had an epiphany. The result Markshire's totally different Portable Persistent Chest System.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nPersistence is the key to a continued experience on any world. Storage of items outside of your personal inventory there is little to do using the basic game. So utilizing a simple single command I have built a system that allows many options not normally found in Persistent Item Storage.\n\nThe following options are capable in Markshire's Portable Persistent Chest System:\nStorage of stackable items. Regardless of number.\nStorage of containers with contents.\nStorage of non-palette custom items.\nMaintenance / organization of your storage space for easier retrieval.\nPortable within the limits of our world.\nMarkshire limits opening chests to Inns, Temples and PC Homes.\n\nStorage Capacity:\n15 containers page over 6 pages\n35 squares per container\nThis allows for a total storage capacity of 3150 squares.\n\nPLUS: Bonus slots for a helmet, a cloak, a necklace, two rings, a pair of boots, a pair of gauntlets, a set of bolts, a set of arrows, and a set of bullets.\n\nComparison:\n\nHow does Markshire Portable Persistent Chest System compare to standard persistent chest systems? Let's look at them:\n\nTypical persistent chest systems are simply placeable objects (chests, armoires, etc.) that have up to 25 windows of inventory at 35 squares per window. That's 875 squares. Not bad.\nThose same systems are limited as to what you can place in there. No stackable items like potions, no containers with inventory of their own, and most definitely no custom items. This is because the systems all destroy the objects and store the references to those items. Then when you open the inventory for the chest again it rebuilds everything.\nThe old persistent chest systems were limited to their placed locations.\n\nNOTE: Dungeon Masters can use the exact same system. Imagine never having to save your Avatar again to store some custom items you made to import or an item you are temporarily removing from a PC. Just pop open your very own chest and voila you have instant access to the same 3150 squares of storage as your Players. If you add the caveat GetIsDM() to the code for the area check you can bypass the Safe Area system.\n\nUpdate:New file added for Key and Instructions for chests. For those that were missing them before.\nUpdated the original ERF with the missing items.\nSee code change at bottom of code window.\n\nNOTE: Aerisarn has created a version of our Portable Persistent Chest that requires NWNX/APS to work and is optimized to reduce lag on chest retrieving by substituting a whole area objects cycle with a GetObjectByTag cycle (so don't change the creature tag :-). Other minors cleanups on chest dialog. Hope you enjoy, the rar has both new erf and module and the original readme (no change to the interface).

These were rejects from the spellfix pack (see my other submissions) either because they've seen very little testing and/or are debatable enchancements and not fixes.\nCall Lighting - Closer to PnP implementation\nHarm, Heal, Mass Heal - 3.5 revised edition rules\nGreater Restoration - No longer restores health, so the Heal changes matter\nBardsong, Curse Song - More Bard-friendly songs.\nIssaacs Greater Missile Storm - Limit to maximum 10 missiles per target.\nTerrifying Rage - Implementation closer to PnP.\nMost interesting to PW coders, who may want to review, test and cherry-pick the spell changes that suit them. I have no further spell-updates planned currently, but suggestions are welcome.\nThe long version:\nCall Lightning in 3.0 SRD: \"To cast call lightning, the character must be in a stormy area\", \"A bolt causes 1d10 points of electrical damage per caster level (maximum 10d10).\" and \"This spell can be used only outdoors. It does not function indoors, underground, or underwater.\" Not fully supported in engine, so implementation changed to d10 in snow or rain weather, fizzles in indoors or underground marked areas. Cast time, material components etc. don't match, but that's true for many spells. Makes the spell much more interesting, works best on PW's with weather-scripts.\nIf you're running a PW, you've most likely already made some kind of nerf to Harm and/or half of your spawns are immune to it. Scribing made this even worse, with people's bags stocked with Harm/Heal scrolls or potions... FR recognized the problem and changed the spells for revised 3.5ed, so here's implementation that may be easier to sell to PnP crowd than a random nerf. Included is also a change to remove full heal from Greater Restoration.\nBardsong and Cursesong performance are personal pet peeve of mine, they're pretty much bard's main arsenal, yet the way they're scripted makes them unreliable and finicky. Ever had your epic bard in party with that RDD/Bard who thinsk they're the latest superstar, blocking your bard-song with their Lasting Impression boosted level 5 bardsong? What, no? Okay, at least you might've sung just a second before the last bardsong expired, wasting a use AND running out of song a few times. Well no matter, the provided new versions allow bardsongs to override current bardsong, so you'll only need to watch out for that level 1 bard interrupting your Lasting Impression...\nWorse, the net effect of Lingering Song and Lasting Impression are actually not what you might expect. First of all, Lasting Impression is applied first, meaning your investment in Lingering Song is wasted as soon as you go epic. Yet this might be a blessing in disguise, since bardsong length actually reduces the frequency at which you can apply your curse song damage! So in this fix, addition first, multiplication then - both feats give you expected 150 rounds, not 105 rounds. And that won't ruin your Curse Song, because you will be able to redo your song damage every 10 rounds no matter what, as one would actually expect.\nNext to Harm/Heal, IGMS gets the worst rep of NWN spells. At level 20 Maximized, it deals 240 magic damage to a single target, which many people feel is too much for single spell. Included is a version that checks the number of targets and cuts missiles to 10 if used against single target - or in other words, limits max. missiles to 10 per target.\nAccording to Epic Levels Handbook, Terrifying Rage's panic lasts for 4d6 rounds, not the 1d4 Bioware implemented. In addition with this version there's full +d20 to Intimidate check, not Bio's +d10. Uses Turned-effect so the victims don't just stand there waiting to be hacked up, but run away. Mindspell and paralyzation immunities no longer prevent effect, but fear immunity does.

Most people expect pickpocketers to be able to choose what they take, which isn't true for stock NWN. I've lost how many times I've heard this suggested for PW's, so here's the code I've written for my own PW. With this it would be possible to go for specific note or letter, for example. One argument against is pickpockets are opportunists and can't be choosy, but this is based on the premise they just wait for the right opportunity.\n\nIt goes in OnAcquiteItem event, because that's the only way to spot pickpocket attempt currently. This means it will only trigger when you would pickpocket an item. Unfortunately I know no way to avoid having this alert the victim. Alternatively, you might use it on pickpocket widget or hak based feat with small changes.\n\nFeatures:\n* Allows selecting any Pickpocketable, non-plot items in inventory.\n* Unidentified items STAY unidentified, but can be identified by pickpocket.\n* If item changes hands before you make your selection, try again.\n* No gold needed to make your pickpocket choice.\n* Handles pickpockets from containers carried by PC's correctly.\n* Automatically closes choice after selection has been made.\n\nUse:\nPut script either directly in OnAcquireItem event, or ExecuteScript it from within that event if you already have one. You will also need to create a blueprint for empty store called STEALSTORE - the script will take care of everything else. Since the script uses the Stolen flag for determining when a pickpocket has occured, the one caveat is that flag should not be set by anything else.\n\nThere are almost unlimited variations that could be desired, so I'm presenting just the barebones version. One possibility is doing a second pickpocket check based on the size or value of the item chosen for stealing. You could also flag items to not be destroyed on pickpocket to provide NPC's with unlimited supply - though it'd be potentially exploitable without limiting frequency or number of pickpockets.

Some people may be familiar with the web-based Dialectizers, such as \"Swedish Chef\" translator etc. Whereas, in NWN, many of us prefer to provide alternate dialog-choices for <9 INT characters, after the first hundred dialogue choices the task of assigning them starts to get somewhat tedious. I figured in common case this could be left for the computer to do, and that's where this script enters in.\n\nAlthough dialogs are very much user input driven, I want to keep things relatively simple for performance and management, so it's a simple string-tokenizer. The process() function takes input string and divides it by spaces, translate() tries a few different combinations of each token to translate and replace() is actual word replacement table. The one provided is just a sample one, not a complete one! The general routine structure is not perfect, nor is it intended to be, but I think it fits the purpose. I think, if you play around with it you will find both how it works and its limitations.\n\nHow this all pulls together is, in your conversation scripts you put something like:\nint StartingConditional()\n{\n sOption = \"Hi, I'm a genius. Want to date me?\";\n if (GetAbilityScore(GetPCSpeaker(), ABILITY_INTELLIGENCE) < 9)\n sOption = process(sOption);\n SetCustomToken(100, sOption);\n return TRUE;\n}\n\nThen, you would put as the conversation option in the dialog tree.\n\nOfcourse, it would be possible to create alternate dialects for rogues, halflings etc. and use those as conditions.\n\nA perfect system would take the context of each word into account in modifying them, but for the most part that is not needed, and would make the system difficult to use while impacting performance. The thought of using this to translate languages has probably already occured to some people, but this is advised against due to a little thing called syntax (and context). Letting players suggest or even build their own dialects is one rather interesting way to use it.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2952":{"Title":"Wildfire","Author":"Donwulff","Submitted":20060213,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Placeables","Description":"This is based on Jassper's Burning/Spreading fires at http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=scripts.Detail&id=835 - I found the scripts nice to spice up DM events, however they were missing just a bit something special...\nActually, my main problem was players were nonchalantly putting the fires out with fireballs. While you can fight fire with fire in some instances, it seemed bit unrealistic and too easy for the players. So I made the fires spread if hit by specific spells.\nI ended up making a number of small improvements, most notably:\n* You can't bash out fires with ranged weapons (though you can overcome their HP)\n* Added a larger fire size for those epic fires\n* Put in special spread mode where the flames will spread by burning destroyable placeables\n* Scorchmarks are destroyed after 12 seconds of putting fire out; found these were causing serious lag\n* Mageflame alternative for magical damage and feed on all spells\n\nUse:\nA few sample placeables are provided, but should you want to make your own, the fire placeable needs to have following events:\nOn Heartbeat: gb_oh_fire\nOn Physically Attacked: gb_opa_fire\nOn Spell Cast At: gb_osca_fire\nOn User Defined: gb_ud_fire_8000\n\nFire spreading is defined in placeable tag, for example:\nFIRE_L_80_20_XX_T\n\nFIRE for normal fire or MAGF for mageflame.\nL can be one of Small, Medium, Large or eXtralarge.\n80 is percent change for fire to spread.\n20 is percent change of parent flame burning out after spreading.\nXX defines direction of spreading - NN, SS, WW, EE, NW, NE, SW, SN or XX for random.\nT is for spreading, use F for non-spreading or X for explosive spread.\n\nDamage caused by MAGF is magical, getting around fire immunities, and this type of fire feeds on and spreads on being hit with any kind of magic.\n\nSmall fire:\n Damage: d4+4\n Radius: 0.75\nMedium fire:\n Damage: 2d4+8\n Radius: 1.0\nLarge fire:\n Damage: 4d4+16\n Radius: 1.5\nExtralarge fire:\n Damage: 5d4+20\n Radius: 2.0\n\nRadius is maximum distance for both damage and normal spreading; explosive spreading has maximum distance of 8.0 with 50% change. If you give the placeables higher hitpoints and damage resistance, bashing them out at close range becomes more appealing alternative.\n\nThe fires will eventually get into places where they can't be put out or out of the game-area, they also remain at same level and disregard contour or water etc. on area. I suppose one could use triggers to limit fire spread, but I use it for DM events and simply keep an eye on things.\n\nThere's a few possible improvements that come to mind, mostly on the vein of using pseudo heartbeats to spread the damage and generic triggers to create no-go and burn-only areas. It may appear laggy, but as far as I can tell it's mostly visual lag, though covering a dozen areas with these flames isn't recommended, even if the fires are only active when a PC is in area. I also thought of using local variables alternatively to determine flame behaviour, so it could be adjusted in DM client, but doing so in the DM-client is such a pain it's probably better it just isn't possible :)","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2953":{"Title":"Sir Elric's Verbal Transitions v1.0","Author":"Sir Elric","Submitted":20060213,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Travel","Expansions":"HOTU-1.66","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Transitions","Includes":"None","Description":"Basically you speak the name of an area to the NPC and she will send you there.\n\nBrief description of how it works:\n==================================\nA unique waypoint, with the same tag, is placed in every area in the module, or only the areas you want to transition to.\n\nUsing these waypoints all these area names are stored to an \"area name tracker\".\n\nFull details and instructions are within the demo module and erf.","Rating":9.5,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"2954":{"Title":"Alternative unlock","Author":"Donwulff","Submitted":20060213,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Other","Description":"If you're like me, you've probably got bored of the fact of just how predictable lockpicking is. On many PW's veteran players feature builds calculate to be just able to open the key doors on the mod - on take 20 ofcourse. Everybody else need not bother. This script was my attempt to combat that, adding a little excitement to lockpicking again.\n\nTo use, set this script into OnUnLock event of the door, chest or similiar. Set lock picking DC to 0 so it will always succeed. Sadly, players will get the NWN built-in lockpicking spam telling them they succeed, but I prefer the convenience over extra widgets and hakpaks. Next, you need to go to placable variables and set LOCK_DC to the real DC you want for the door and LOCK_GUARD to the blueprint resref of whatever you want to guard your door.\n\nIt's as simple as that. Now, instead of always take-20 succeeding on the lockpick with no risk to themselves, a standard skill-check is rolled on the attempt every time. On a natural 20, the lockpicking always succeeds, and lockpicking is no longer the domain of extreme powerbuilds only. However, on a failure the DC for your next attempt is increased by 5, and on a natural 1 the specified guard is spawned within line of sight to you, and will do guardly things.\n\nIf you use the script as is, you may want to set the guard to a faction that's hostile to player (but not to anything else on the area) or you can use more complex guard script.\n\nSome alternative suggestions for PW's include breaking invis/sanctuary effects on lockpicking (otherwise it just gets too easy) or limiting success on natural 20 to DC's 40 or so higher than skill only. This version is intended for generic adventuring use, where the character is MEANT to eventually get through.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2955":{"Title":"Scarface's Socketed Items v2.5","Author":"Scarface","Submitted":20060214,"Updated":20070918,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Other","Forums":"Link","Description":"I have totally re-written the socket item system and the way it works. \n\nYou now target the socket items with the gem's unique power (Just as it should be) instead of vice versa. \n\nYou can use the item's unique power to check how many socket slots are left on the item. \n\nBecase so much of the code has been optimized and modified, it is no longer compatible with the old socket items and gems, however this one is far superior and has alot more options so it's in your best interest ti change over. \n\nYou can use both this and the old version together, but I would recommend just using this one.\n\nFor those of you who don't know what socketed items are I will explain...

Features normally reserved for important characters, like 2nd time recongnition, now can easily be added for all characters with very little scripting.\n\nSKILLS REQUIRED: _Basic_ NWScript knowledge.\n\nNOTE: Due to lack of hosting capability, I can't test the mutliplayer or MMOPRG aspect of NWN with ZZ-Dialog! I have made every effort to allow mutliple players the ability to talk to the same object at the same time (sans items) while have unique dynamic conversations.\n\n---\nTo install ZZ-Dialog:\n---\n\n- Unzip the archive into a temporary folder.\n\n- Move ZZDialog.erf into the erf folder that is in your NWN folder.\n\n- Move ZZ-Dialog Example.mod into the mod folder that is in your NWW folder.\n\n---\nTo setup ZZ-Dialog into a module:\n---\n\nNOTE: Always backup your module manually before importing ANYTHING!\n\n- Open up the module in Aurora.\n\n- Go to the file menu, and select \"import\".\n\n- Find and open ZZDialog.erf.\n\n- Ignore the missing file warning by clicking yes.\n\n- Follow on-screen instructions to complete import.\n\n- You are done, see script files starting with dlg, such as dlg_Twins or dlg_poet for examples.\n\n- IMPORTANT NOTE for 1.66 or earlier users! One feature requires 1.67, but can be disabled by commenting out the lines with SetName and SetPortrait in the script file \"zzdlg_main_inc\". This feature is for multi-way conversations!\n\n---\nTo setup objects to use ZZ-Dialog\n---\n\n- First, open in-game the module titled \"ZZ-Dialog Example\".\n\n- In here are example objects that are configured to use ZZ-Dialog.\n\n- Examine the signs near each example to see information on how to import.\n\n- Post on NWN Scripting Forum on Bioware's site if you have further problems. Make sure to reference ZZ-Dialog and its version number in the topic title for clarity.\n\n---\nWhat can ZZ-Dialog do for me?\n---\n\nFirst off, it is an enhancement of Z-Dialog released by pspeed. So all the features it has are supported. However, ZZ-Dialog is not compatible with Z-Dialog. Z-Dialog and ZZ-Dialog _can_ run side-by-side. Specifically the features of ZZ-Dialog are:\n\n- Can handle large sets of responses with ease by adding the automatically generated responses \"Next Page\" and \"Previous Page\". The maximum shown responses per page can be changed at any time at run-time. \n\n- Automatically generated responses for Next page, Previous page, Reset (user- defined behavior) and End Conversation. These responses can have their labels changed, along with their color and their enabled state.\n\n- Gives three methods of adding responses: action, spoken and basic. The coloring, or lack of coloring, varies based on the type.\n\n- Easy to configure using the script named, \"zzdlg_config\". You can change the default colors and labels for automatically generated responses. As well as the default maximum responses to be viewed at a time (between 5 and 15).\n\n- Easy to understand object handling. You don't need to know who or what is talking to whom. The player is referred to as \"player\" and \"speaker\" while the object being talked to is referred to as \"speakee\".\n\n- Multiple-way conversations by dynamic coding. This feature requires the beta patch for 1.67 or greater to use. This feature uses a ghost copy of the original speakee, and will move from NPC to NPC whenever the speakee is changed.\n\n- Includes an easy to use token system which includes all tokens that are built in Aurora. This file is \"zzdlg_tokens_inc\" and can be included in as many dialog scripts as needed.\n\n- Implement 7 functions for event-based scripting. Main() only needs to call dlgOnMessage(). See example dlg_* scripts for usage.\n\n- Includes a simple color library that uses the html standard color values. The script is \"zzdlg_color_inc\", and is already included in the main package.\n\n- Have functions which easily know who is whom when manipulated local data. dlgSetPlayerDataInt() and dlgSetSpeakeeDataInt() are two names of these helper functions.\n\n- This library is _extremely_ easy to use. You can create _all_ your conversation using this. In fact, if you use alot of conditionals in your normal conversations then you will actually have an easier time maintaining ZZ-Dialog script files.\n\n---\nFuture releases ideas for ZZ-Dialog\n---\n\n- Skill checks with uniform appearance and easy to configure DC calculations.\n\n- Add lists as helpers, like how I made GetLocalInt and such easier.\n\n- Add simple to use sounds and animations functions for speaker/speakee.","Rating":9.44,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"2986":{"Title":"Kagrenac's Tools","Author":"ScorpioChess","Submitted":20060325,"Updated":20080814,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Multiple Effects","Includes":"Custom","Description":".","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2987":{"Title":"Sunjammer's Footprint System","Author":"Sunjammer","Submitted":20060326,"Updated":20100518,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"NWN-1.66","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Sunjammer's Footprint System\n26/03/06\nv1.02\n\nA simple yet highly configurable method to produce a temporary trail of placeable \"footprints\" behind a PC or creature.\n\nThe system allows almost every aspect of a footprint to be configured using a variety of custom properties.

Duclos\nAka: Na�Stone Quickshadow\n\n\nThis is a handy little application for making Custom CNR recipes for your Neverwinter Knights module if you have CNR installed. This Script Assistant makes writing custom recipes for items a snap! The application partially removes the need to make redundant keystrokes, simply select the device, and fill in the appropriate blanks, item tags, quantities, descriptions and level requirements for the PC abilities as well as the recipe level. Also the Script Assistant is designed only for creating the �User_Recipe_Init script file�. Use this application at your own Risk! I am not responsible! Ever!!!! \n\n\nThe User_Recipe_Init script file is completely constructed from the data you entered into the assistant. Simply copy the entire script from notepad and paste it into the User_Recipe_Init script within Aurora Toolset. This is based on the assumption that the user has some idea about what they are doing.\n\nThe basic structure of the script is performed for you but you are responsible for all of the spelling and grammar of the item tags and item names and descriptions. \n\nThis recipe assistant was created from the need to find a more efficient way of disposing of items left over from a kill; namely skeleton knuckles, fire beetle bellies and so on.\n\nIn my opinion the CNR is the natural choice to use with the HCR ( ). Because the hunger and fatigue system built into the HCR requires the PC to consume food and drink at regular intervals which can be acquired within the CNR by crafting and trade skills. With this in mind, you can create items such as �Bastard Beer� if you combined components like two skeleton knuckles, one slaad�s tongue, a bucket of wort and sugar. The point is simply this: your imagination is the limit to what you can create. \n\nThis is my first contribution to the community.

It requires NWNX to be installed and running in order to use it. Detailed instructions and the necessary program files are included in the self-extracting executable to the right. The scriptset makes use of the amazing NWNX plugin, nwnx_chat, by Dumbo. Nwnx_chat adds a new event, OnSpeech, which you can use to hook any script off of any player, DM, or ever server speech event. You can also use it to SUPPRESS that speech, making possible a variety of tools long desired by the community, like the ability to stop spam, add language filters, prevent dead players from talking, and so on. When 1.69 came along, Bioware added the chat event, but it still couldn't capture tells, which left nwnx_chat the superior method of chat capture, since aside from parsing tells, logging them, and seeing them ingame, SIMTools makes use of them for command targeting, which allows even more flexibility than the DM Client. I've arranged a large number of different options in as streamlined and efficient a way as I could, almost all of which can be toggled on or off. Feature List: o Supports both NWNX and Bioware standard databases.o Can log all chat on the server at the user's option.o Can reset the server via chat command. Unlike calling StartNewModule, the reset plugin stops the nwserver process, clearing the memory to eliminate lag buildup.o Has a built-in spamblocker.o Has 2 classes of power, DM and aministrator, with configurable powers, designated by cd key.o DMs and admins can view all tells on the server at the user's option, when logged in as player and/or dungeon master.o DMs and admins can view all dm channel messages on the server at the user's option, when logged in as a player.o Has 83 languages. Characters many speak the languages, either as one-liners, if the have the needed class, race, or subrace. Listeners receive an optional Lore check to understand even if they don't speak the language, and another (much lower) to at least recognize what languages is being spoken.o Has metachannels. Metachannels are added chat channels. They are very similar to the party channel, in that players control who is in their metachannel via invites. They may invite whomever they like, however, and are not limited to the members of their party. There is no set number of metachannels; rather, a metachannel is created whenever a player wants. The first invite sent out determines who the 'leader' of the metachannel is. When that invite is accepted, the inviter becomes the leader of a new metachannel. From that point on, any messages that any member types that begin with '/m' will be sent to every member of the metachannel, via the combat log. Metachannels will be logged with other text if you enable text logging. If you are uncertain what use these channels could be put to, the whole reason that I implemented them at all was for guild use on my PW, but I'm certain they will find other uses.o One, some, or all channels may be disabled when players are dead or silenced, at the users option.o One, some, or all channels may be disabled permanently, at the users option.o Players and dms have acces to a large number of emotes and commands, listed below: Emotes These are the emotes you can use via chat. They can be typed into any chat channel (party, talk, shout, etc.) and have the same effect in all of them. They are case insensitive. Most emotes also have a two-letter shortcut which may be used instead, in parentheses to the right of the emote. *agree (*ag) *beg (*bg) *bend (*bn) *bored (*bo) *bow (*bw) *cantrip (*ca) *cast (*cs) *celebrate (*cl) *chat (*ct) *cheer (*ch) *chuckle (*ck) *curtsy (*cy) *dance (*da) *dead (*dd) *demand (*dm) *die (*di) *dodge (*dg) *drink (*dr) *drunk (*dn) *duck (*dk) *exhausted (*ex) *fall (*fl) *fatigue (*fa) *fiddle (*fi) *fidget (*fg) *flop (*fp) *giggle (*gi) (female only) *greet (*gr) *hooray (*hy) *hum (*hm) *laugh (*la) *meditate (*md) *mock (*mo) *nap (*np) *no *nod (*nd) *peer (*pe) *plead (*pl) *pray (*pr) *prone (*pn) *puke (*pu) *read (*re) *salute (*sa) *scan (*sn) *scratch (*sc) *shift (*sh) *sing (*sg) *sip *sit (*si) *sleep (*sl) *smoke (*sm) *snore *spasm (*sp) *steal (*st) *stretch (*sr) *stoop (*so) *swipe (*sw) *talk (*tl) *taunt (*ta) *threaten (*th) *tired (*ti) *vomit (*vm) *wave (*wa) *whistle (*wh) *woozy (*wz) *worship (*wo) *yawn (*yw) Commands These are the commands you can use via chat.

For DUR, BEAM, and EYES visuals, a duration type and duration must be specified, and you may also choose to make the effect extraordinary (undispellable) or supernatural (not removed by rest), or both. The format: dm_fx (vfx#) (duration type#) (duration) (E/S/SE) . Duration type is either 1 for temporary or 2 for permanent. Duration is the number of seconds to want the effect to last. Example: to apply a dominated vfx effect to the target for a duration of 5 minutes (300 seconds): dm_vfx 209 1 300 . To make that same effect Extraordinary: dm_vfx 209 1 300 E . To make pemanent vfx you use 2 for the type, and use 0 for the number of seconds: dm_vfx 209 2 0 . Because vfx numbers are far from intuitive, a dm_fx_list_* command is available to show what vfx # creates what effect. dm_fx_list_* = Lists the vfx numbers and names of each type of vfx, by replacing the asterisk with one of 6 three-letter fx type codes: dur, bea, eye, imp, com, fnf.

There is also a demo module called Killer Death System 1 Demo.mod included in the zip file (put it into your /modules folder to try it out). Installing the system into your module will give you a Purgatory death system where you can choose from several penalties to return from purgatory to a church. You can also have your friends resurrect you where you died, or carry you to a priest to do it there. Optionally, it imposes a purgatory timer that automatically makes the penalty choice for you & sends you to the church if you don't make a choice, get rezzed by a buddy, or get taken to a priest within a certain amount of time after death.\n\nVersion 1.1:\n Fixed a bug that allowed hostile creatures to attack a player's dead body when it gets created upon his death.\n Also added support for marking areas that won't be used by the purgatory system (see details about this in the Readme file).\n\nVersion 1.2:\n Added a module variable to allow the penalty behavior when a character is exactly at the start of a level to be toggled to take gold & items instead of getting a free-ride.\n Also fixed a bug -- thankyou tallon_firedrake!\n\nVersion 1.3:\n Added in a female dead body blueprint and updated the include libarary so dead PCs left behind will have the correct gender.\n \nVersion 1.31:\n Fixed a bug in the spellhook script introduced when v1.3 was created.\n \nVersion 2.0:\n Added new option to allow builders to force PCs to drop their inventory, equipment, gold, or any combination of these three things into a loot bag created at their death spot when they die.\n Added new options to the purgatory conversation to allow players the choice to return to where they died rather than to the Church.\n Added module variables to allow builders to configure the new return to where you died options.\n Added a new feature to allow for XP &/or GP penalties to be assessed when players are ressurrected \"in the field\" either by another PC using a RaiseDead or Resurrection spell cast either from memory, from an item (like a rod or scroll), or by an NPC Rez Priest when the player's dead body is carried to one.\n Added module variable to allow builders to configure the level at which players will have to start paying to leave purgatory. Known now as the \"Pay Level\", it used to be fixed at level 6. Now you can set a module variable to configure that level.\n Updated the system to take advantage of new scripting features introduced in NWN patches v1.67 & v1.68.\n Added the ability to customize per PC level how many items will be taken from them when they choose a lose-an-item option to leave purgatory.\n \nVersion 2.1:\n Updated the system to be compatible with v1.69. Those sticking with NWN v1.68 should use version 2.0 instead. You must be running NWN v1.69 to use this or any future versions of KDS1. Important changes must be made to your OnClientEnter event to support the new NWN v1.69 horse system (See Section IV-D in the Readme file).\n \nVersion 2.2:\n Bug fix, now when the dying PCs are made to drop their gold in a loot bag, it will also destroy the gold they are carrying so gold can't be duped oops.\n Added alignment & race options so you can have multiple alignment &/or race based purgatory areas.\n Read the 2.2 upgrade addendum. I didn't bother to update any of the other docs.\n\n\nRequirements.\n--------------\nKiller Death System 1 should work with any expansion pack combination including no expansion packs, but you need to patch your game up to v1.69 or later to use this package. The KDS1 system is not compatible with all custom content you may add to your module. It should work fine with the CEP, but any custom systems you add must not use the module's OnPlayerRespawn or OnPlayerDeath events or the spellhooking system or there will be conflicts. KDS1 requires exclusive control over those two module events and the spellhooking system and cannot share it with another system. Actually the spellhooking part can be worked around if you know what you are doing and can alter the spellhooking script from the other system to incorporate the one from KDS1 or vice-versa (see details in Section IV-B-14-b of the Readme file).\n\nThe system is meant for use in multi-player modules, however it can be used in a single-player module as well. It will be impossible to accomplish any of the resurrection options for leaving purgatory (see section IV-A of the readme file) in a single-player game since they require another PC to perform them, but the penalty options will all still function OK -- there will be no way for a player to get out of purgatory without paying a penalty and going to the church in a single player game (actually I suppose you could create an auto NPC that searches for dead PC bodies and casts a Resurrection on them -- that should work in a single player game to get the PC out of purgatory with no penalty like in multi-player, tho it seems kinda pointless).\n\n\nUser's Guide.\n--------------\nThe included Readme file is a User's Guide describing all the details you will need to know about in order to install and use KDS1 in your modules.\n\nVersion 2.2 additions are described only in the v2.2 Addendum document.\n","Rating":9.97,"Votes":22,"Awards":[]},"2996":{"Title":"Simple Store Cleaner","Author":"RiffRaff","Submitted":20060409,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"NWN-1.67","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Store","Includes":"None","Description":"This code can be added to your onunaquire event to keep your stores from getting cluttered up with tons of items.\n\nThis script destroys any object sold to a merchant.","Rating":9.67,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"2997":{"Title":"Associate Puppet Code","Author":"bloodsong","Submitted":20060412,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Creature Related","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Listening","Description":" Allows players (and DMs) to puppet their associates -- familiar, animal companion, summoned, dominated.

On top of that most Shifter form abilities and Palemaster touch attacks have been increased dramatically, as well as the breath weapons for both dragon/wyrmling forms, and for Red Dragon Disciples. As if that wasn't enough all summoned creatures through spells can now be altered to the module designer's desire (found in creatures, custom 5 -thanks shadguy-).\n\n Also included many glitch/exploit fixes gathered from the vault, most importantly being the infinite cast fix, my own fast cast fix, the Continual Light exploit fix, my recent Holy Avenger fix, and a few more...\n\n-----\n\nChanges are simply to numerous to list in full, most are increased and some are toned down to make sense, but to give you a general idea:\n\n-----\n\n-Damage cap has been raised in all cases, if it was 20 dice it is now 40 dice, 15 now 30, 10 now 20, etc, area of effect damage from spells are also doubled.\n\n-All DC's are increased by approximate spell level, for levels 1 to 4/+3, 5 to 7/+4, 8 and higher/+5, also increased DC's for Shifter form and abilities and Palemaster touch attacks (they are actually useful now).\n\n-Damage Reduction from spells has it's modifier increased by two in all cases (Greater Stoneskin now soaks +6 or below for example).\n\n-Breath weapon damage for Dragon Shape and Red Dragon Disciples is doubled, and the DC's for Dragon Shape and Wymling Shape are raised.\n\n-Enchantment Bonuses increased as well as damage, Bless Weapon/Magic Weapon +3, Blade Thirst +6, Blackstaff +8, Greater magic Weapon now caps at +10 at 30 level, instead of +5 at 15.\n\n-Finger of Death/Destruction Damage increased to a 20 to 120 on a failed save, 30 to 180 for Weird (Weird's Dc is only +3 though, not +5).\n\n-Heal/Mass heal follow 3.5 rules -except- the cap is now 300 or 10 per level up to 30.\n\n-Greater Restoration no longer heals hitpoints, just removes effects.\n\n-Harm and Drown do a maximum of half the targets -current- Hitpoints, and in the case of harm of the target was already under half their -max- Hitpoints, it will do 30 to 180.\n\n-Shadow Shield no longer provides Immunity to Necromancy, just Death magic and only a 50% Negative Damage Immunity.\n\n-Premonition now provides Immunity to Sneak Attack as well.\n\n-Globes of Invulnerability now absords 6 level spells or lower, 4 for Minor Globe.\n\n-Bigby's Hands now have their Str check reduced by 5.\n\n-Dispells level cap are upped by 5 in all cases. \n\n-Breaches now reduce Spell resistance by 6 and 10 respectively (Lesser/Greater) and strip effects by 4/8.\n\n-Spell Mantles absorb up approximately 10 more spell levels for each spell respectively.\n\n-Greater Sanctuary and Timestop and now on timers preventing chain castings (courtesy of Slicer) and Timestop is Area of Effect only (PW friendly).\n\n-Meteor Swarm can do up to 480 damage now, Tide of Battle up to 500.\n\n-Hellball and Greater Ruin are as per my fixes now (damage is increased to make them -epic-)\n\n-All summoned creatures can be tweaked via the toolset with no scripting required.\n\n-And many many more...\n\n-----\n\n The reason why I did this was two reasons, one to collect all the various spell fixes on the vault (the ones I think are best balanced anyway) and have them in one download. And Two and more importantly to make spells useful again, Bioware should of done this themselves when HoTU came out (just my opinion) but didn't, and I was tired of Fighter/Weapon Master/Rogue Combos and the like running around with 700 Hit Points and 300 damage crits, while the poor mage pretty much has to spam missle storms just to keep up with them whether PvP or PvM.\n\n So this is it, feel free to add to it, alter it, and if you find any bugs, fix them. :P In any case it is all here for you now if like me, you think spells should be spells again...\n\n Installation is easy, import the erf, select yes to overwrite all scripts and your done.\n\n ***Note*** If you want to use the Holy Avenger fix, you must replace (*or preferably add these scripts to) your Module's OnPlayerEquip and OnPlayerUnEquip events with the holy_equip and holy_unequip scripts, importing these scripts will not overwrite your current module event scripts, I made these two optional, however the holy_equip script contains the command (Delay/ClearAllActions) to prevent the Fastcast glitch, if you desire to use this without the Holy Avenger fix, simply copy the command line from that script into your module OnPlayerEquip script.\n***Best Idea is to simply add all the code -to- your current Equip/Unequip events instead if replacing them if you use NWN's tag based system in your module, adding the code right below the \"void main\" shouldn't change any original code.\n\n***Added ELBS_Powerword_kill to fix a bug. It -should- affect creatures of 200 hp or less for death and 100 in a loop. Caught this at the last minute, simply import this erf -after- the ELBS erf, overwrite the file (select yes) and all should be fine.\n\n***You will get a compile error with the spell Mass Dominate (nw_s0_massdom), do not worry this effects nothing.\n\n Enjoy.\n","Rating":9.61,"Votes":13,"Awards":[]},"3030":{"Title":"Persistent Player Owned Shop v2.1","Author":"Rami_Ahmed","Submitted":20060511,"Updated":20110602,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"Requires Both Expansions (SoU & HotU)","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Store","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Buy a shop from the goverment, sell your own items to other players and sell the shop again!\n\n* Fully persistent.\n* Very easy to set up.\n* Very player friendly, easy to use.\n* With salesmen, need them to sell your stuff.\n* With easy storeage system.\n* Comes with small Demo Module.\n* Both NWNx2 version & BioWare database version available.\nNWN2 version: link \n\nInitial Release: 11/5/2006 (v1.0)\n - \n\nMajor Update: 12/5/2006 (v1.5)\n - Fixed so that when items are sold, they dont reappear.\n - Added new options for the owner of a shop (Including name-changing).\n - Added new options for the builder in the ModuleLoad script.\n - Made a semi-caching system when recovering items for the store.\n - Fixed some typo's.\n - Other minor bug fixes.\n - Added an normal shop to the demo module, for testing reasons. \n\nMedium Update: 12/5/2006 (v1.6)\n - Fixed a few typo's.\n - Fixed a single semi-bug.\n - Added an version using NWNX2/APS.\n - Added an option to fire salesmen (doh!).\n\nMinor Update: 13/5/2006 (still v1.6)\n - Bug fixes.\n - Added an option to disable salary paying totally.\n\nMedium Update: 14/5/2006 (v1.7)\n - Fixed critical bugs.\n - Added an option for the user to change item prices a bit.\n - Cleaned up the conversation a lot.\n\nMinor Update: 15/5/2006 (still v1.7)\n - Minor bug fixes.\n\nMinor Update: 15/5/2006 (v1.7b)\n - VERY critical bug fix.\n * Thanks to Leomist for finding it and solving it!\n\nMajor Update: 18/5/2006 (v2.0)\n - Now the player can have 2 stores with different items and different prices.\n - The shop can both buy and sell items.

Simple silly thing you can throw in here and there in multiplayer games. It doesn't do a dam thing in single player games. It'll work in just about any object or event in the game. Put it on doors, placeables, NPCs, etc. Knowing when you want it to go off will determine what script event you should put it in. I'm sure it won't work for every single possible spell, you'll have to experiment with that. You should be able to use it for party buffs or party pain.\nIt isn't very robust at all, and there are numerous ways to avoid the effects,\nbut it does add a bit of fun and variation for a few days. I originally used it on a keg of ale in one of my taverns. The party leader could get drinks for everyone for free, but everyone else in the party would have to pay a little blood for their's. Later I put it on a door to try and get party members to prefer gathering there before proceeding, and on an NPC that healed everyone except the leader.\nIf a party leader 'opens' it, nothing happens. If anyone else 'opens' it, every creature in his party gets hit with a magic missile except the party leader, and the guy who opened it gets an extra one.

But it is more too, under this system the NPC's name will only be revealed to the PC who he introduced himself/herself to, and not all the PC's that percieve him/her, other PC's will still not \"see\" his/her name.\n\nI did this because of a thread I read in the NWN2 forums where it was said \"I always thought it stupid you knew an NPC's name before you met him\".\n\nHere is the short run down of how it works.\n\nSimply import the Erf into your module and select yes to overwrite all resources, \"x2_def_percept\" will be overwritten.\n\nIn any line **except the very first line, this will not work and the entire conversation will not activate if you put this in the first line of the dialogue** of the conversation file for any NPC where they speak their name somewhere in that conversation, put the script \"reveal_name\". Make sure the PC has to see and **use** the line of dialogue where this script is in the \"actions taken\" tab. The best place in my opinion would be **all** the \"End Dialogue\" lines in the conversation, but any line that will be used will do except the first.\n\nAnd you are good to go, the NPC's name will be revealed to only the one he/she introduced him/herself too.\n\n***Note please don't use this if in your conversation the NPC never says his/her name. :P\n\n***To use this system with default NPC's/creatures always make sure \"x2_def_percept\" is the script name in the \"On_Percieved\" tab in the creature script properties. Most cases it already is, but some default creatures in the toolset have a different script (earlier one).\n\n***Right now this is not persistent in multiplayer but could very very easily be adapted to persistence. Although names will be revealed only to the player the NPC greeted, that player would see the name disappear if another player came into the area with the NPC who wasn't \"introduced\" yet, of course the original player would still know the NPC's name. I know using conditionals the appearance of the NPC only introducing him/herself once per player can be easily adapted.\n\nIncluded in the rar is the Erf for importing and a small demo mod to see it in action. To use the demo, talk to the NPC, then go into the other area and use the switch, then when you go back to him he will not have a name.

So we have added our own system.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nThe system is designed to promote teamwork (aka Parties) and to better reflect your actual experiences in combat. The system utilizes a new formula that is modified from the PnP base. (thanks to Cayle for working it out with us)\n\nThe single PC receives a base award now. It will say \"Combat XP Award:\" then the amount of experience gained. \n\nHow other creatures affect your Combat XP Awards:\n\nParties - If you are in a party you will receive a Teamwork Bonus for working together. It is listed as a separate award \"Teamwork XP Bonus:\" under the combat XP.\nParty Location - If you are not in the same area as the killer of the creature you will not receive an XP award.\nHenchmen - The use of henchmen is a \"crutch\" and detracts from your experience as you adventure. You will receive less XP while using a henchman. Even if partied with a group of PCs.\nSummoned, Companions, and Familiars - These creatures are part of who you are as a PC and do not cause a penalty.\nSummoned Enemies - Creatures summoned by enemies do not generate XP awards. As per D&D rules, the Master of the summoned creature has already had their CR adjusted to take this into account.\n\nThe system also checks the party for level disparity. If you are outside the average range of the party's average level then you will be held in disparity and receive a penalty to your XP award and not receive a Teamwork Bonus.

It is not designed for PWs, though you may be able to modify it to suit your PWs needs (I just won�t support that use).\n-System contains: 1 conversation file, 6 scripts, 2 placeables, 3 items.\n\nWhat RESt does:\nWhen the player clicks the rest button, a conversation will come up, and rest is cancelled. The conversation is bare-bones, but meant to be used by the builder to add in class features, information on the module, or whatever else they like.\n\nThere is an option from the menu (only one by default) to rest. When you select it, checks are made to see what your class needs to rest in that area (wilderness-oriented classes need less to sleep in the wilds).\n\nIf they have what is needed, and if the area itself isn't restricted by the builder, they will rest. The screen fades to black for 20 seconds (the length for resting in this system regardless of PC level) whereupon 8 hours time is passed, if the rester is the party leader/playing single player. If the rest is cancelled or interrupted, only 3-6 hours pass.\n\nThe builder may choose to set up random encounters in areas; this is done via placement of waypoints, and adjusting variables on the waypoints. The encounters spawned can each have up to 3 different creatures, and as many in number as you want. \n\nThe encounters DO NOT scale to PC level. The only scaling that occurs is done by careful builder use of the system; the creature tables are ordered by challenge rating, so keeping the maximum number low, you keep the challenge down.\n\nThe system is set for the builder to tell it which race of monster to pick, then to pick a subtable from that, and even to put in additional variables to narrow it down.\n\nHowever, it can be left to be very randomized. You can have the encounter -entirely- random if you wanted to. Or you can select the racial type, and the system can choose the subtable and the creatures appropriately from that.\n\nRest encounter chance is determined by the builder, and then it is modified by difficulty level setting, and resting near a campfire makes encounters less likely as well.\n\n\nThere are two versions of the module--the only difference between the CEP (v1.53) and non-CEP versions of the .mod is that the encounters include the CEP creatures, and without CEP installed it may sometimes seem like the system is not working correctly (when in fact it is). The system is use-able without CEP, however, and I wanted the demo of this system to be as wide-open to people as possible. :)\n\nSee the readme included in the download for the full information!\n-DS","Rating":9.75,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"3100":{"Title":"Sit on the ground","Author":"Sharona Curves","Submitted":20060718,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"None","Forums":"Link","Description":"I was trying tonight to have the PC sit on a bedroll.

It is not designed for PWs, though you may be able to modify it to suit your PWs needs (I just won�t support that use).\n\n\nWhat it does/how it works:\nDeity Favor is a concept I developed to represent interactions between your devotion to your chosen deity, and their blessings on you for being devoted. It is entirely dynamic in that it requires no DM to be present/is a scripted system. \n\nDFS allows players to gain favor with their Deity by prayers and offerings of valuable items. This can make for an excellent money sink/economy tool. But it rewards the players, too!\n\nWhen players have earned high favor with their deity, they may receive boosts at the beginning of a fight, or be granted a useful temporary effect, or given a potion appropriate to the deity.\n\nClerics and Paladins� bless, prayer, and bless weapon spells are improved by having high favor. As is their turning ability, if they are holding their deity�s holy symbol aloft!\n\nIf the player neglects their deity enough, they may become angry and curse them during battle. It is not difficult to maintain favor, however (the system is not tedious ;) ).\n\nClerics and Paladins especially need to work at maintaining favor, as the altered spells and turning, when used, drains their favor. All classes� favor is drained when respawning, and when granted a boost in battle.\n\nSometimes when entering bleed (not flat-out dying) the deity will choose to heal you!\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the effect of the DFS is balanced to not make playing without it unbearable. It is a nice boost to religious characters and classes without destroying existing balance systems.\n\n\n\nSee the readme included in the download for the full information!\n-DS","Rating":9.56,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"3103":{"Title":"Custom Healing Kit","Author":"Kilana","Submitted":20060718,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"Requires Both Expansions (SoU & HotU)","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Unique Items","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"Requires: TAG Based Scripting Enabled.\n\nThis special \"Healer's Kit\" script is meant to be an alternative/replacement for the standard Bioware Healer's Kits.\n\n-Healing is capped at 75% of the Target's MAX HP.\n-HP Restoration = (Heal Skill) + d2(Kit Level)\n-Instead of outright Curing Poisons and Diseases, kits will apply Fortitude Save Bonuses vs. Disease/Poison (Amount Depends on Kit Level).

In this demo, there are scripted systems to handle dangers from water (drowning), dehydration (heat), frostbite (cold), smoke inhalation, acid, fire, and lava. \n\nThe dehydration, frostbite, and fire systems are dramatically affected by the clothing you wear (or don't wear as the case may be). I have commented the code so if you really want to see the specifics just open the scripts to see what I have done. Needless to say, the systems take into account about every detail I could think of. If anybody sees something I left out, let me know and I will check it out for addition. \n\nAn emphasis was given to trying to make the systems work as described in the DMG with one major exception: I opted to not use subdual damage. A builder with some scripting skill could easily switch this system to using subdual damage, but I found it would not be as useful since many developers already have subdual systems in place. Other minor changes were made to the DMG rules to make it work better in the NWN environment.\n\nAlso provided is a trap script which handles any placeabe trap I could think of. This \"Universal Trap Script\" handles traps using variables set on a trigger. I have demonstrated this in the demo module with every type of custom trap given in CEP.\n\nFinally, a trigger is provided that will give each PC a bit of XP for exploring. The trigger can be used as needed and will only give XP to each PC once. The XP amount is set via a local integer on the trigger itself. The triggers MUST have unique tags.\n\nThe great thing about this script set is that they can be used together in one area. For demonstration, please note that I have both the Fire system and the Heat system running in the \"Fiery Pit of Doom.\" This means that PCs dehydrate due to the intense heat and can catch on fire too . . . basically you can stack this as you need. \n\nDetails of each system are given in the README for easier reference.\n\nInstall and useage instructions are also given in the README.\n\nEACH SYSTEM IS PROVIDED AS \"STAND ALONE\" AS WELL AS IN A \"COMPLETE PACKAGE.\" You can use what you need, and forget the rest if you want to . . .

And on top of that, bards in general are a pretty underpowered class as most will agree. \n\nThis is an attempt to add some variety to the bards song arsenal without the abuse factor like Lich's Lyrics.\n\nIncluded in this package is 4 new bard scripted bard songs. Like Lich's Lyrics the bard songs are used via items, but unlike Lich's Lyrics they follow the same rules as the actual bard song.\n\nA bard song is consumed each time one of my items is activated and you must have a bard song to use the items.\n\nOnly 1 bard song may be active at a time and the effects do not stack. So hence if you try and use one of my bard songs, then attempt to use the standard bard song, the effects will not take ahold.\n\nThe new songs last the same as the orginal bard song as well, plus longer if the player has the Lasting Inspiration or Lingering Song Feat. The songs cannot be used while silenced and have no effect on deafened players.\n\nThe 4 new bard songs have the following effects when used :\n\nLathander's Lyrics of Lights = Slowly heals the bard/party's hitpoints over time based on the bards perform skill.\n\nAkadia's Accelandro = Increase the movement speed of bard/party based on the bard's perform skill.\n\nHelm's Hymn of Faith = Bestows Greater Sanctuary on the party but not the bard.\n\nMystra's Musical Warding = Increases the parties damage resistance to fire/cold/acid/electrical based on the bard's perform skill.\n\nThese songs are easily customizable so you can change how powerful each song is based on the perform skill of the bard. Hence if you wanted the Healing Song to heal less points per perform skill, you can change it via the mr_bard_source script.\n\nIn addition to that, there is a prevention to the exploit of saving skill points. If turned on, the bard songs will also take into account the number of bard levels the bard has when determing the power of the song. So hence, a powerbuilder who takes 1 level of bard and dumps a ton of points into perform would get very little bonus from using my new songs.\n\nOpen the rar file and read the instructions for installion and customizing.\n\nIf you like my work or have suggestions for more songs, please post! I am hoping to do some more songs if the community has a use for these.\n\nUPDATED 8/1/06 : Sorry its a bit late, but fixed the songs so they have the bard music and the floating notes when used.\n","Rating":9.75,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"3115":{"Title":"Herbalism/Athletics Skill Sytem and Call Animal ability","Author":"DirgeSinger","Submitted":20060729,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Area","Expansions":"CEP-1.53 Requires Community Expansion Project","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Skill Checks","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Always wanted to be able to gather herbs in the wilderness?

This system reproduces Lycanthropy and Werewolves as described in the DnD 3.5 \nMonster Manual.\n\n.: Overview :.\nWhen a person contracts lycanthropy through the bite of a werewolf, no symptoms appear until the first night of the next full moon. On that night, an involuntary change occurs, and the person assumes the form of the animal.\n\nThe person is subject to involuntary change under each full moon. \n\nIf the person succeeds a Wisdom Check (DC 15), he becomes aware of his lycanthropic condition. If he fails this check, he remembers nothing of the previous night.\n\nEven if a person is aware of the condition, they must still roll a Will \nsave (DC + number of times he's transformed). If he fails the save, he \nstarts to assume the alignment of the lycanthrope.\n\nOnce a person is aware of their affliction, they can attempt to change to animal or hybrid form by using the Control Shape Tool.\n\n.: Changing Form :.\nA person may attempt to change as often as they like, with one exception. If \nthey attempt to resume their humanoid form, they only receive one chance. \nIf they fail, they must remain in animal or hybrid form until dawn.\n\nChanging to animal or hybrid form ruins the character's armor and clothing. \nMagic armor survives the change if it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.\n\n.: Control Shape Tool :.\nThis tool can be used to control lycanthropy as described in the DnD 3.5 Monster Manual (page 303).\n\nSince there is no skill for \"Control Shape\" in NWN, I've substituted the \n\"Craft Armor\" skill. \n\nSo, if you are going to be a lifelong werewolf, you can start putting points \ninto \"Craft Armor\" to help control your shape.\n\n.: Curing Lycanthropy :.\n** An afflicted lycanthrope who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called Wolfsbane) within 1 hour of a lycanthrope's attack can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to shake off the affliction. If a healer administers the herb, their Heal skill will be used if it is higher than the lycanthropes save. The character gets only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed.\n\nSince belladonna is toxic, the person must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save \nor take 1d6 points of Strength damage. One minute later, they must make the \nsame save again or take 2d6 Strength damage.\n\n** A Remove Disease or Heal spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher also cures the affliction, provided the person receives the spell within three days of the lycanthropes attack.\n\n** The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast \"Remove Curse\" on the person during one of the three days of the full moon. After receiving the \nspell, the person must succeed on a DC 20 Will Save to brake the curse. \n(The caster knows if the spell works). If the save fails, the process must \nbe repeated. People undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined \nin cages until the cure takes effect.\n\n.: Features :.\n - Persistent using the BiowareDB\n - Players can infect other players\n - Supports all Werecreatures in the CEP2\n - Players can infect NPCs during the full moon\n - Items use Tag Based Item Activation\n - Control Shape tool allows player to assume Humanoid, Hybrid, or Animal form\n - Includes easy to use hooks for Module Events\n - Includes Configuration file for easy customization, including all displayed text\n - Dawn/Dusk Module Event Hooks\n - Includes 3 Custom Creatures\n - System works with Item Level Restrictions\n - Uses default Bioware Belladonna item (ITEMS / STANDARD / MISC / OTHER / Belladonna\n - Werewolf Properties can not be dispelled\n\n.: Version History :.\n\nVersion 1.0\n * Updated to work with CEP 2.4\n * Changed appearance Bandit NPC to fix graphic glitches (thanks A.L.)\n * Minor tweaks\n\nVersion .99c\n * Minor update.

Form clusters in alleys or fill a massive valley with just one Spawner object.\n\nHigh Level players can not ruin the game for lower levels because encounters do not cater to player level.\n\n2da-based creature lists allows for easy adding and modifying of creatures without touching the toolset.\n\nBuild two groups of opposing factions to set up battlefields quickly and eaily.\n\nResRefs are selected using a formula to reduce the number of 2da calls and prioritize which resrefs are selected.\n\nIf you run a large PW that's been using encounter triggers up until now you should notice a MAJOR drop in file size after converting to this system.\n\n\nThis is the first version of this code and I am accepting requests and suggestions on how to improve it so that it is more appealing to PWs.

Ever want to have an item that required more than a simple 100gp to identify? Ever want to have an item that would change its name when identified? Ever want to customize the restrictions on an item? The Legacy Artifact System makes all of this possible.\n\nThe Legacy Artifact System was built for the Cold Shadows gameworld and is designed for creating new and exciting artifact-level items for modules and PWs. With this system a builder can design an item that will grow in power as the PC advances in level. Any combination of item properties that your module allows can be added at specified character levels by simply adding a coded string variable to an item. The system uses classic tag-based scripting (all items tagged CS_It_Legacy), so if you are not employing this technique, some modification will be required.\n\nThere is also a robust restriction system that will disallow full use of an item if the requirements are not met. A single coded string variable handles this as well. Race, alignment, class, and base ability scores are all included. This could also be easily expanded to handle skill levels, feats, deity, etc. These restrictions only apply to added legacy properties and are hard coded so that even Use Magic Item skill will not help. Items can be coded with base properties usable by anyone (assuming there is not some other restriction in play).\n\n\nExpansion:\n\nI've added an identification system. This is apart from the identification system in the game. In general, powerful artifacts should require a little more in-depth research or consultation of knowledgeable sources in order to be identified. I leave the method of identification to individual builders (the demo mod has one simple example). Basically, you will call one function to identify a Legacy Item. This will remove the ID flag and will replace the original name with the identified or \"true\" name of the item.\n\n\nI also added a Use Magic Device override. You can configure an item to allow PCs with a sufficient base UMD skill level to override the item restrictions and gain the Legacy Properties.\n\nThe download contains a demo mod, a readme, and an erf containing the two scripts.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3175":{"Title":"Rest Script","Author":"Julimei","Submitted":20060919,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Area","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Resting","Description":"This is my rest script.\nIt�s starts your normal rest menu for players and for special accounts it starts your dm menu.

It is now possible to make an NPC wave, rant, plead, etc. while socialising.\n- Sociable NPCs now ignore DMs.\n- If an NPC is now set to social group -1, they will only socialise with PCs.\n- Added an ambient setting which makes NPCs occasionally perform ambient animations, such as looking tired, looking far away, etc.\n- Added chair settings for NPCs. This supports a different chair for at home and elsewhere. Either or both chairs may be used.\n","Rating":9.42,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"3191":{"Title":"Portable Trashcan","Author":"Moraya_69","Submitted":20061001,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Unique Items","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Sick of carrying loot around all day . . well loot as you go with a spawnable barrel that gives you up to 100% for your identified loot items (% is customizable)\n\nEnjoy Belia Del'fin Islands of Desire\n\nUnique power self only item is in tutorial pallette","Rating":7.67,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"3192":{"Title":"Horse Dismount","Author":"Moraya_69","Submitted":20061002,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"CEP-2.00 Requires Community Expansion Project","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Unique Items","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Dont feel like making hitching rails for horses everywhere give your horsey set one of these.

The basic algorithm is by Scarface, but I've reworked the implementation to be more efficient, and added a few features.\n\nWhat hasn't changed: \nThis uses no loops, and only fires for players who have the HiPS feat via a pseudo-heartbeat function (which, in theory, should be pretty efficient, unless your server is full of Shadowdancers and Shifters).\n\nWhat has changed:\nThe basic implementation is more efficient, players are told how long they have to wait if they try to re-enter stealth too soon, and the delay before re-entering stealth is uniform (a flat 6 seconds, instead of between 1 and 10 seconds). Furthermore, players are only restricted from re-entering stealth if they were involved in combat. (This adds a little complexity to the script, but can be easily removed if efficiency is at a premium.)\n\nIn addition, I've provided a hook that will enforce these restrictions on Shifters in Kobold Commando form.\n\n\nTo use:\nSave this file in your erf directory, then import it into your module. You'll need to update your OnClientEnter, OnPlayerLevelUp, and OnPlayerEquipItem events. Directions are included in the script comments.\n\nIf the delay is not to your liking, you can change it by adjusting the constant in tk_hips_inc and re-compiling your scripts.","Rating":9,"Awards":[]},"3196":{"Title":"Variable Driven Scripted Item Handling","Author":"Tallman","Submitted":20061009,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Multiple Effects","Includes":"None","Description":"This began as an attempt to streamline the scripted item handling in my mod to make it more efficient and elegant. \nI began to notice that the scripted items in my mod, which is a PW, seemed to fall into one of several catagories. This makes it so one script can handle a whole class of items. To make an item work, all that needs to be done is put the correct varables on the item. When the unique power is used, the module on activate item script looks at the ITEM_TYPE variable and executes the correct generic script which in turn pull the spacific information it needs from variables on the item. Item types include:\nKEY � For Master Keys. In our mod, we had master keys to player homes that could make copies for friends and family. Also, the owner could teleport directly to their house.\n\nSUMMON � For Summoning Items\n\nTELEPORT � For Teleport Items\n\nPOLYMORPH � For Polymorph Items\n\nCONVERSATION � For Items that run a conversation to provide a choice for other functions.\n\nOnce the system is in place, often no scripts need to be written to make a new item. Best of all, items can be manufactured on the fly and muled in by a DM with no update necessary. And it cuts down on redundant scripts that do the same thing with one small difference like teleporting to different places or playmorphing into different shapes.\n\nI hope this makes it easier to create scripted items and keeps your module from becoming cluttered and bloated.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3197":{"Title":"Rune Gate- NWNX Version","Author":"Tallman","Submitted":20061009,"Updated":20061122,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Portals","Includes":"Custom","Description":"This is a pair of items to allow teleporting.

You can view this system seperately by visiting the following link:\nLink\n\nIf you use the persistent journal version, you must add the following \nline of code to your Module OnClientEnter script:\n\nRebuildJournalQuestEntries(GetEnteringObject());\n\nAfter that, you need to put the following above the main funciton of\nthe OnClientEneter script:\n\n#include \"pqj_include\"\n\nThe main advantage of this system is that builders can make quests without the need to write scripts. Another advantage of this system is that a builder does not have to have unique quest management scripts for every single quest developed in a module. In the end, this system can litteraly cut out scores of scripts from a module, thus reducing file size and making module development more manageable. \n\nIt should be noted that the system manages typical quest needs that are \npretty much universal to all quest building. Quest specific code will still have to be developed by the builder if \"special\" things are needed. Regardless, the system does \nreduce script overhead . . . even for more advanced building needs.\n\nFurthermore, this system is capable of managing quest tracking/advancement, \nquest resetting, XP distribution, Gold Reward/Payment,conversation based skill checks, alignment shifts, and item/gold possession prerequisites for conversation conditionals.\n\nTo see how the system is implemented, please play through the demo module.\nThe demo module is actually a brief tutorial that shows the basics of how the system works in a simplistic quest. The tutorial describes what\nis happening in the quest conversations and where code is being used.\n\nA builder can make far more complicated quests than that seen in the demo module with a little creativity and planning. You can even make non-linear quests with this system. A simple example would be to make a series of smaller sub-quests that interconnect to bring forth an overlying major plot. To complete the end sequence, the player must do all the sub-plot activity to get clues or items or whatever. They could do the sub-plots in any order, and a final check can be made to see if they have done everything they need to finish the major plot. This system can manage \nmost of this activity, however it is likely that a few custom scripts will\nbe needed to check that all sub-plots are finished to move on to the final\nplot sequence.\n\nAll scripts included start with the prefix \"vg_\" so that you can manage them easily in the toolset. The only exception is the script \"pgj_include\" I decided not to change the prefix of this to honor Knat's work as being his\nown and not mine.","Rating":9.88,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"3221":{"Title":"ambient tweaks","Author":"Corey Holcomb-Hockin","Submitted":20061120,"Updated":20070220,"Category":"Creature AI","Expansions":"HOTU-1.68","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"BioWare AI","Description":"These changes to X0_I0_ANIMS will only be useful if you use NW_HOME waypoints to have your NPCs move in and out of their houses depending on the time of day. \nThe problem I had with the default behavior was that the NPC would close the door on each other.

But to get started, you'll need to know what you can download and where to put it.\n\nPlayers:\n\nWhat players need to download is determined by which features your module was built with. In the simple case, players don't need to download anything. In more complex cases, they'll need the .haks and .tlk, and maybe an override.\n\nDDPP_haks_and_tlk_2.zip: This zipped file contains two .hak files that need to go into your hak directory, and a .tlk file that needs to go into your tlk directory. These are only needed for modules that make full use of favored weapons and the new domains.\n\nDDPP_Domain_Override.zip: This links to another vault entry containing an override version of the new domains. It's useful for choosing the new domains at character creation in multiplayer, or for adding the new domains to your single-player games.\n\nReadMe.txt: This is a more in-depth description of features. Players can focus on just the parts of this file dealing with the new domains and favored weapons.\n\n\nBuilders:\n\nReadMe.txt: This is a more in-depth description of features, installation, and use. For your reading enjoyment.\n\nDEMO_Pantheon_2.zip: A demo module showing the basic system without favored weapons. This should be unzipped and placed in your modules directory so you can play it.\n\nDEMO_Pantheon_Plus_2.zip: A demo module showing the basic system with favored weapons. This should be unzipped and placed in your modules directory so you can play it. Requires the talk file and the non-CEP hak.\n\nDDPPantheon_erf_2.zip: This zipped file contains the .erf file with the basic deity system. The .erf file should go into your erf directory, then imported into your module. Overwrite nw_s0_bescurse (.ncs and .nss), nw_s0_sphchaos (.ncs and .nss), and nw_s2_turndead (.ncs and .nss).\n\nDDPP_Full_2.zip: This zipped file contains all of the above, plus some additional files so you can use the full system, including favored weapons. The additional files are:\n\n* DDPPantheonConvo.erf: The conversation (with scripts) that is used in the demo module to let a PC choose a deity from your pantheon. This should go into your erf directory, then imported into your module (if you want to use it).\n\n* DDPP_haks_and_tlk_2.zip: This zipped file contains the .hak and .tlk files you'll need to associate with your module to make full use of favored weapons. (The .hak files go into your hak directory, and the .tlk file goes into your tlk directory.) There are two .hak's, but you only need to associate one with your module. If you use CEP, associate your module with DDPP-CEP.hak, and give this hak a higher priority than the CEP haks. Otherwise, associate your module with DDPP.hak. In either case, use ddpp.tlk as your module's custom talk file. (Yes, it can replace the CEP talk file.)\n\n* DDPP_Domain_Override.zip: This zipped file is included for convenience. Unzipping its contents into your override directory is an alternate way to access the new domains.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nCurrently, this package provides the ability to force clerics to follow a member of your pantheon and to adhere to the race, alignment, and domain restrictions of that deity. There is also an implementation of favored weapons that provides minor bonuses and penalties depending on whether or not a cleric is wielding the favored weapon of her deity. (For details, see the readme file.) A real strength of this package, though, is that it provides a framework and templates for you to define your own in-game effects. One example of this customization is the sample conversation that lets a PC choose a deity.\n\nNote: This system does not require a hak file to function. The hak (and talk) file merely provides better feedback to the player about the effects of favored weapons (and it enables the chaos, law, and luck domains). If you choose to not use the hak, you can still use this package, minus the free proficiency for favored weapons.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Simple customization: Modifying the pantheon is fairly simple and straight-forward. There is only one script to edit (deity_onload), and minimal scripting knowledge is required.\n\n* Three pantheons included to get you started: core, Greyhawk, and Forgotten Realms. (NOTE: These pantheons might be a little inaccurate since I worked from Wikipedia instead of rulebooks.)\n\n* Modularity: Choose which aspects of this package you want to use by either calling or not calling the provided functions in your module's event scripts.\n\n* Updatable: The code that is most likely to change if updates are needed (deity_core*) is kept separate from customized code (deity_onload and deity_include). This means that if this system is updated, you can update your module without losing your customizations.\n\n* Domains: Clerics may choose any two of their deity's domains. If desired, a deity can be given a domain twice, allowing a cleric to choose that domain in combination with any other domain.\n\n* New Domains: By using the optional override or hak, clerics are given access to the Chaos, Law, and Luck domains. For details about these domains, see the readme file.\n\n* Alignments: Clerics failing to maintain an acceptable alignment are prevented from advancing as a cleric. \"Acceptable\" is defined by the cleric's deity. In addition, alignment must match domains (good alignment if the Good Domain was chosen, evil for the Evil Domain, lawful for the Law Domain, and chaotic for the Chaos Domain). The latter check can be turned off by changing a constant in deity_configure.\n\n* (Sub-)Race: In addition to requiring clerics to be of certain races, a deity can require clerics to be a particular subrace.\n\n* Lolth is hardcoded to only allow female clerics. (Objections anyone?)\n\n* Favored Weapons: If a deity is given a favored weapon in the pantheon definition, and if this part of the package is enabled, clerics of that deity receive minor bonuses for wielding that weapon. Not wielding the weapon incurs penalties. The exact bonus/penalty depends on the cleric's level. The penalties were chosen so that they would negate part of the cleric's advancement, rather than causing the cleric to become less capable after advancing. (Multiclassed epic characters sometimes are exceptions to this rule.)\n\n* Dynamic: You can add deities at any time. Deletion of deities is not supported. Changing deity details is supported, but be wary of annoying your players.\n\n* Deity selection: Allows for strange capitalization of the deity field at character creation, as well as entering only a deity's first or last name. Furthermore, the optional conversation will allow a PC to choose a deity after character creation.\n\n* Rewards: Includes a function that will shift a PC's alignment to be closer to the PC's deity's alignment.\n\n* Storing effects: Includes a function that will store an effect's parameters as local variables, and a second function that will return the effect described.\n\n* Extensibility: The information stored about each deity can be extended as much as you want. This requires a little more scripting knowledge than adding a deity, but it comes down to following a template. Some sample extensions are included. To access these extensions, be sure to include \"deity_include\" in the relevant scripts.\n\nI think minimal scripting ability allows sufficient use of these features, and moderate scripting ability can accomplish a lot with them.\n\n\nNew stuff:\n\n* Chaos, Law, and Luck Domains have been added (via hak or override).\n\n* Favored weapon system implemented.\n\n* Effects specific to a deity (e.g. the result of praying at a temple) can now be stored and retrieved using SetLocalEffect() and GetLocalEffect().\n\n* Some configuration options have been moved to deity_configure.\n\n* The SetDeityWeapon() and GetDeityWeapon() functions have been moved from deity_include to the core scripts. If you are updating and want to preserve your include file, all you need to do is delete these two functions from your modified deity_include.\n\n* Reorganized the files on April 16 but didn't change the contents from the March 6 version.\n\nJanuary 2010:\n\nI finally updated this for NWN 1.69. Sorry it took so long. There are no real changes, though, unless you are making use of the favored weapon portion. (The basic demo module did not need updating, but I figured I would keep the download names similar.) The \"full\" download is not yet updated. I plan to keep the older \"full\" download available for those who cannot update to 1.69, and a new 1.69 version will (hopefully) be ready in a few days.\n\n* Because BioWare overran the \"safe lines\" in one of the .2da's, the 1.69 version is incompatible with the pre-1.69 version. As a consequence, the haks have been renamed. This is only an issue for those making use of the favored weapon portion.\n\n* Haks (and scripts) have been updated to support CEP 2.3.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3223":{"Title":"Sir Elric's Player Validity Checker(beta v1.4)","Author":"Sir Elric","Submitted":20061123,"Updated":20080424,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Anti Cheating","Includes":"Custom","Description":"For use on servers not using ELC to help stop player hackers from logging in with epic feats, high skill or ability points and bulk hitpoints.\n\nThis is NOT not an exact ELC style check but it will severely limit PC hackers on non ELC servers\n\nBasically a newly created character's ability points, skill points, feats and hitpoints are checked for any abnormalities if any are found the player is booted, their cdkey is recorded to the database and DM's alerted.

Added new stabling options. Updated database system to improve efficiency and allow use on Linux servers, as well as give users more options. Added more �ownerless� horse options. Added in jousting phenotypes, toggle by using the deed while mounted. Added the ability to run mount and jousting checks into horse_cfg.\nv0.8.1b- Fixed a bug where large phenotypes were not detected as mounted. Improved the internal random numbering of deeds.\nv0.8- OnDeath event script added to fix the \"turn you into a dwarf\" bug. A couple changes made to \"ownerless\" and NPC owned horses to ensure databases aren't saved, and make it cleaner for DM's to spawn generic ridable horses in-game. Added support for auto-numbering of deeds (helps with selling deeds at standard merchants, giving NPCs horses, and allows DM's to spawn generic deeds in game). Made horse conversations private. Made changes to the DM Horse Widget (used to be DM Mount Widget) for a future upgrade. Fixed error that caused a horse to respawn dead after it had been raised. Disabled database support on Linux-based servers due to NWN bug. Disabled radial menu access to animals' inventories (this can cause an exploit or errors).\nv0.7- Added CEP 2.1 / NWN 1.69 models. Added barding options to seller conversation. Added radial menu functionality (flaky for henchmen). Added stabling functionality. Undroppable deeds can not be sold. Renamed a few functions so that the system can work along side NWN's built in system (see horse_inc_h for a list of functions that changed). Added serveral �user� functions. Fixed a bug on override locals for the seller. Renamed horse blueprints for easier recognition. Added support to allow mounting of �ownerless� horses.\nv0.6- Modified to function with CEP 2.1 / NWN 1.69 (still works with CEP 2.0 and 1.68). Fixed Pack Ox bug.\nv0.5- Added henchman support. Fixed bug in horse seller conversation. Fixed bug that duplicated animals. Fixed bugs that made animals reappear in the wrong place. Fixed issues that allowed horses through restricted area transitions. General improvement of system internal workings. Added multiple new functions to \"horse_inc_h\". Added \"unsupported\" multi-server PW functions to \"horse_inc_h\".\nv0.4- Corrected a bug that made horses reappear in the wrong place when a PC logs back into a server after logging out while riding. Added a new script for area transitions. Animals will resist fighting their owner and their owner's friends. Made a change to the distance pack animals follow theor owner. Fixed a bug that allowed animals to follow the PC through restricted transitions if there was no hitching rail. Dead animal corpses no longer follow PC's through transitions, and PC's can access their inventory by using the animal's deed near the corpse.\nv0.3- corrected bugs relating to horses not re-appeaering where they should. Changed animals' faction to \"Merchant.\" Changed the default rules to allow DM to ride any ridable animal.\nv0.2- changed the way using a deed's unique ability calls the horse. It now makes a lot more sense.

For example, you could get an enchanted drop at lvl 30 or if you are lucky, a powerful one at lvl 7. There is always the chance of a broken item too.

I also made it so you can choose to have the flavor text trigger once, once per PC, or every time (like \"Flexible Flavor Text and Skill Checks\" by LucidTaint).\n\nOkay, here's how it works. Paint a trigger and attach this script to its OnEnter event handler. After painting the trigger set the following:\n \n Trigger Name: Flavor Text\n Trigger Tag : UniqueTag_N000\n\n Where\n - \"Flavor Text\" is the text you want displayed when triggered.\n - \"UniqueTag\" can be anything (even something not unique).\n - \"N\" is 0 to display text each time it is triggered,\n or 1 to display text just the first time it is triggered.\n or 2 to display text once per PC.\n - \"000\" is any 3 digit number (should be unique if N = 2).\n\n That is enough for the trigger to work. However, this script\n doesn't end there. Original flavor text can be overridden or\n scripting may be added, using the switch/case statement.\n\n Or, skip the name changing of the trigger altogether, and just\n use the switch/case statement to add all flavor text.\n\nThis script was an exercise in bitwise operations for me. I ended up using local variables with 31 bits to keep track of 31 triggers. This means that this script sets only 33 local variables to track 1000 triggers. \n\nPlease forgive me for this crappy description, this is my first submission.

To see the system in action check out our single player (SP) module called Towers of Dregar: Xora�s Vial, Link The system is used in a few places within Towers of Dregar: Xora�s Vial and it will give one a good grasp of how to set up quests and environments. The SP module also has a five minute tutorial in the first area to give one an idea of how AID works and some things that you can do with it. Download the module for a quick introduction to AID.\n\nWe are releasing AID as just a core package so that anybody wanting to implement the system in to a PW or a game module will have no extra junk in the import, it is all AID.\n\nWhat is AID you ask? \nAmbiguous Interactive Dungeons is designed to let builders and GMs create non-leading puzzles that retain the difficulty they would have in a PnP game. It enables a narrative atmosphere that can be detailed and rich while still engaging the players interactively.\n\nAID is designed to be used in two fashions: in pre-built dungeons or scenarios like one might design for a single player module, and in GMed multiplayer games. To allow GMs to use AID on the fly while running a multiplayer session there are a few special tools that allow GMs to set up much more detailed settings, on a microscopic scale, and convey them to players without bogging down the flow of the game.\n\nWhen you are thinking of AID imagine the days of Zork and the text based games, this is similar in nature.\n\nVisit Layonara Online at Link if you want to provide feedback or report bugs on AID.","Rating":9.95,"Votes":12,"Awards":[]},"3262":{"Title":"MurlynLAN's Player, Merchant and Banking System!","Author":"MurlynLAN","Submitted":20070228,"Updated":20070826,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Other","Description":"Huge, modular system for NWN1:\n'Bank Accounts', 'Player Owned Shops and Stalls', 'Tolls, Taxes and Town Bonds', 'Citizenship System', 'DM and Staff Control System', 'Local Investments & Shares', 'War and Conflict', 'Trade Workshops', 'Prestige Class Trials' and Much, Much, MORE!\n\nEDIT:\nDevelopment of this system is currently on hold.

Using it without the Flagsets package installed in your module won't work.\n\nKMB allows you to create map pages and map books for your players that control how their mini-map works. Areas in your module are marked with a region variable that determines what map page the area appears on. Each area can only appear on one map page (regional map), but each map page depicts an entire region of your world consisting of any number of areas. Areas are not required to appear on any map which allows you to have some unmapped areas. Map pages can be carried separately or players can add them into map books if they have one. Players can show their maps or books to other players to allow for sharing of map information between them. When a player enters an area and he is carrying the map page that corresponds to that area or has the map page in his map book, the mini-map for the area is revealed for him. There is a maximum of 32 different map pages or regions you can use in your module. Areas can also be marked with a special region called the unmappable region. Players entering an area that belongs to the unmappable region have their mini-map reset to all black each time they enter the area.\n\nThe package includes an erf file and a hak file containing all the scripts and blueprints required by the system. No other content is overwritten or replaced so it is compatible with all haks or other custom content you've already added. Be sure to study the readme file in full as it describes the whole system and how to set up and use it.\n\nKMB is a persistent system so all maps and books will retain their contents across server resets.\n\n** NWN2 Note: Since I do not own NWN2 there is no way for me to test this\n out to see if it all works the same over there. If you try it\n in NWN2 please let me know one way or the other how it turns\n out for you.\n\nI. Requirements.\n=================\nYou must have the NWN game installed, both expansion packs SOU & HOTU, and patch version 1.68 or later to use this package. You must also be using my Flagsets Vault Package v1.3 or later in your module. In addition to that, your module must be set up to use the tag-based item scripting system. All modules are set up to use this system by default, but it can get disabled if you change any of the item-related scripts in the event slots of the module's property panels from their defaults (i.e. OnActivateItem, OnAcquireItem, etc). You can learn more about tag-based item scripting and how to set up or verify you have it set up right by visiting my Tag-Based Item Scripting Help Page.\n\nThe KMB system should be compatible with all custom content you add to your module including CEP1, CEP2, PRC, CNR, NWNX2, CTP and any other letter combos you find out there in the NWN community.\n","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3272":{"Title":"SAT - Siege Across Transitions","Author":"ChardWreck","Submitted":20070309,"Updated":20070907,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"Fire siege weapons from one area into an adjacent area.\n\nWant to lay siege to the city but the gates are locked?\n\nWant to soften up the defenders before you begin your attack on their outpost?\n\nSAT will allow your players to attack with their siege weapons without having to be in the area as long as there is an area transition between the two area.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOutside Restriction - Both areas must be outside.

The demo module requires SoU+HotU. Miorg supports CEP weapons, but does not require CEP.\n\nWHAT IS MIORG?\n----------------\nMiorg is a simple script suite designed to help players make sense of cluttered inventories. Miorg allows the player to automatically sort small, prolific items such as keys, gems, potions, and more into specially-marked bags. Miorg can also reorganize the player's inventory, automatically eliminating gaps and fragmentation and ensuring optimal usage of space.\n\nMiorg is an excellent time-saver for any adventurer. On more than one one occasion, I have spent at least a full minute at a merchant looking for a single gem that I was certain I picked up, but that has slipped between the cracks of my other inventory items. With Miorg, a few simple clicks will filter all of your gemstones into a single bag (or multiple bags, if you need that many).\n\nMiorg is completely non-invasive. It does not modify any standard BioWare scripts, and thus should fit into almost any module with no difficulty. Miorg's sort categories are also easily extendable and modifiable.\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED?\n------------------\nThe download contains the complete .erf package to implement Miorg in your module. Also included is a demonstration module that will show you how Miorg works. You can even import one of your beleaguered characters into the demo module, reorganize your inventory with a few mouse clicks, and export him or her back out again.\n\nAUTHOR'S COMMENTARY\n---------------------\nMiorg is my first submission to the vault. Since I haven't seen any inventory sorters on the vault, and since I'm already working on a campaign anyway, I decided to give it a shot myself. Miorg is the result. I hope folks find it useful.\n\nBear in mind that v0.33a is a beta release. I've done a lot of testing and fixed a lot of bugs, but nobody's perfect.

Added screenshot.\nApril 13, 2007: Initial release (v1.0). \n\nA complete revision history can be found in history.txt, below.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n==============\nSwitch-Based Secret Doors allows you to easily place secret doors that are opened remotely by switches, which can be either hidden (requiring search checks to find) or in plain sight. Switch-Based Secret Doors cannot be found simply by searching a section of wall. Rather, the secret that must be found is hidden on some other object - a torch sconce, a statue, a piece of furniture, or any other placeable - which may not even be useable or selectable until the player finds the secret.\n\nSwitch-Based Secret Doors also supports multiple types of secret doors (one-way, two-way, linked, timed, or any combination, plus special socketed switches), special flavor text for individual switches, cross-area switching, and no-hassle henchman searching.\n\nFEATURES\n==========\n* Uses standard Bioware secret door detection algorithms in a new way. Instead of searching for the door, players must search for the mechanism that controls it - which can be anywhere in the area or even anywhere in the module, not just in front of the door.\n* Open secret doors remotely with any placeable object. Use the object a second time to close (and hide!) the door.\n* Hide door switches inside ordinary placeables - EVEN unuseable objects, which look exactly like static background objects until the secret is found. Make your players work for their secrets and think about where the trigger might be hidden, instead of just homing in on the obvious useable statue in the corner.\n* Are your switches too deviously hidden? SBSD allows your players' henchmen to search for them, automatically, with no special AI positioning required.\n* Precision searching: Need to limit your players' line of sight when searching? Use a precision searching trigger to define exactly where a player has to be in order to find the switch. Use precision searching to hide switches in narrow cul-de-sacs, behind counters and furniture, inside closets, and more, without players being able to find the switch through walls and other obstacles.\n* Two-way secret doors: One switch can open and close two secret doors simultaneously, without the annoyance of having two different doors that must be searched for and found seperately.\n* One-way secret doors: Doors that slam shut after you walk through them. These doors have animated entrances and exits - instead of suddenly appearing in front of a blank wall, you'll see the door shut behind you and disappear.\n* Link multiple switches to the same secret door. Two or more levers, secret switches, or hidden buttons all operate in sync to open and close the same door.\n* Timed secret doors that automatically close and disappear after the specified period of time has elapsed.\n* Socketed mechanisms that only open when the correct object is inserted.\n* Optional and configurable percentile modifiers to search skill and detection range for passive search mode.\n* No extra fuss for traps - place them directly on the mechanism.\n* Completely configurable flavor text. Each individual switch, even among linked switches, can send a unique message to the player when he or she finds the secret or activates it - without requiring any extra scripts. Default flavor text is automatically displayed if no special text is set.\n* Multiple henchmen and their associates are all brought through the door with the player.\n* Supports multiple door graphics, with easy extensibility for custom doors.\n* For persistent worlds, rehide your switches after a certain amount of time, or when the area is empty of players.\n* Non-invasive: NO overwriting of Bioware standard resources.\n* Includes demonstration module.\n\nAUTHOR'S COMMENTARY\n=====================\nThe SBSD suite is my attempt to make secret doors in NWN more interesting. It's never very exciting to scan along a wall to find a random inexplicably-revolving section of stone; the fun comes in pulling levers, finding hidden switches, racing towards doors that threaten to slam shut in your face, and generally outsmarting the dungeon architect.\n\nSBSD contains a variety of different ways to make your dungeon environment more interactive, and make finding secret doors more logical and more engaging for your players.\n\nI hope you enjoy SBSD.

In fact, it goes as far as possible (I think) without either a client-side hak/override or a lot of scripting. Furthermore, this script is ready to implement true-level scribing, once someone makes the needed item properties available (or modifies every spell script).\n\nSo what does this package do? BioWare's Scribe Scroll script ignored a PC's caster level. This script does not. It makes the resulting scroll as powerful as possible, without going over the PC's level (unless the weakest possible scroll is already over the PC's level, in which case the weakest possible is used).\n\nThere are limits, though. The caster levels available for scrolls are limited to those found in iprp_spells.2da, so not every caster level is possible. To see what levels are available in BioWare's version of that file, download and read Scroll_levels.txt. Every spell & level combo listed in that file is a possibility with this script.\n\nIf you want to extend iprp_spells.2da to allow all (or more) possible caster levels, download and read Extended_scribing.txt to see how to change the included .2da so that this scroll scribing system accesses your new item properties. There is still a bit of work involved, but this will save you from having to re-write the scroll scribing script.\n\n\nYes, this package contains a .2da, even though I said there would be no haks and no client-side overrides. This .2da only needs to go into the server's override directory; your players do not need it. Hak-free PW's can use this system.\n\n\n\nPlayers: If you want to use this better Scribe Scroll in your single-player modules, download the \"PlayerOverride\" zip file and unzip its contents into your override directory.\n\nBuilders: If you want to use this better Scribe Scroll in the module you're building, download and unzip the \"BuilderVersion\" zip file. Inside, there's an .erf file that gets imported into your module, overwriting the standard BioWare resources x2_inc_craft and x2_pc_craft, and there's a .2da file that can either be packaged into a .hak or used as a server-side override (place it in the override directory the server will use). There is also a merge document that can be helpful if you have already customized the standard BioWare script x2_inc_craft.\n\nServer hosts: If you're hosting a module that you don't want to modify, the \"PlayerOverride\" version should work if it's unzipped into your server's override directory.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* With this system, scribed scrolls can only be used by the class that created them.\n\n* Any spell you can cast is scribable, except War Cry. For some reason, there is no War Cry scroll in the core resources. If you have a War Cry scroll in your module, you can make that spell scribable by replacing the \"****\" in the the \"BaseScroll\" column of row 373 of the included .2da with the ResRef of your War Cry scroll.\n\n* Creating the .2da required significant data entry. I've verified a good chunk of it in-game, but the possibility of a typo still exists. If you find an error, please let me know.\n\n* One other thing I thought of... If you use this with a module that has custom spells, you can get weird results if you try to scribe the custom spells. Adding enough rows to the included .2da would fix this. (\"Enough rows\" = \"rows in your custom spells.2da\")\n\n* Scribed scrolls now automatically stack.

In the unlikely event you 'have' altered this script, only 2 functions are used and they are core functions that altering would greatly affect the gameplay.\n2) 5 Placeable objects found under Cutsom - Special - 5. These are \"Flames\" (x3), \"Powderkegs\" and \"Scorched\".\nThe flames are the 3 sizes of flame placeable used by the system. Other flame placeables within the module will not operate as intended, so \nif you want to use this system for spreading fires, you must use these placeables.\nThe powderkegs are to demonstrate the 'explosive' properties, which can cause certain objects to explode when burnt.\n\n3) One Item object Found under Custom - Special - 5. This is named \"~\" and MUST NOT BE USED or altered in anyway, ever! This is necessary for Z-Axis vector calculations.\nThe ~ Item is an integral object that is necessary for calculations used by the script. It is not intended for use as an item.\n \nTo use the functionality, simply place (either by spell-hook, DM-Client, script or within the toolset) any of the 3 custom flames at a suitable location. (It is recommended that the smallest of the flame placeables included in the system are started with). As soon as the flames are placed, they will begin to spread and burn objects in their path.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n1) Reacts to placeable types, i.e. Wooden objects burn fiercely, stone objects do not.\n2) Tilesets. Damp, wet, raining, snowing, wooden floor, sand all have different effects on the spread of the fire.\n3) Heat. A larger blaze will have a larger 'heat-radius' which can inflict damage at distance.\n4) Well optimised. The scripts have been finely tuned to minimalise slow-down (or 'lag') as much as possible, making the system suitable for PW modules.\n5) Allowances made for tag-based systems to prevent destruction of necessary placeables.\n6) Flames damage melee attackers, size of blaze affects range and damage.\n7) Blazes and Infernos. As the fires grow, they can grow into raging infernoes, dealing more damage and spreading further.\n8) Configuration settings. A simple system of 'switchable' settings are included to customise the system.\n\nFixes & Changes in this Version: THIS VERSION IS ALTERED AT CORE. UNFORTUNATELY PREVIOUS VERSION EXCESS SCRIPTS WILL NEED TO BE REMOVED AND OBJECT INSTANCES UPDATED. THIS INCONVENIENCE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED FOR FUTURE VERSIONS.\n\n1) Added Explosive properties, demonstrated by inclusion of 'Powderkeg' placeables.\n2) Fixed a bug in OnDamage event of flames, caused by GetDamageDealtByType() returning negative values when no damage was done.\n3) Added ambient lighting changes when blazes are large.\n4) Optimised OnDamage system further, also removed constant HB scripts.\n5) Attempting to harm Flames by melee will result in possible damage dealt to attacker.\n6) Only Magic, Cold, and Acid will harm the fires.\n7) Fixed Errors in Placeable code which prevented extinguisher and non-flammable objects being recognised.\n8) Added Debugging info.\n9) All scripts re-written and optimised meaning less scripts overall and combining common functions into a single 'include' dependency.\n10) Added configurable switches and constants. Please see \"fire_sys_config\" for details.\n11) Fixed Bug with incorrect flame-count recording.\n12) Fixed an issue with flames not growing or spreading out.\n13) Flames now shrink and decay 'realistically' when extinguished.\n14) Fixed errors in new spawn location scripts that were ignoring invalid spawns.\n15) Fixed damage amount and radius to be correctly proportional.\n16) Substituted GetNearest for GetNextInShape type object functions for realism and efficiency.\n \nBugs & Errors Noted:\n1) Multiple fires in one area, despite beng separated by vast distances will still contribute to the overall 'blaze'\n2) Damage Resistance feedback OnDamage for flames gives odd and incorrect results. This is due to the lack of toolset functionality to apply DR to placeables as would be done with creatures, and the script recalculates the HP of the flames.\n3) Flames atop Tall placeables will not burn them. This is due to the pivotal pont of the placeable being 'out of reach' to the flame, despite the flame touching the placeable mesh. Tghis may not be fixed, depending on efficiency of using further z-axis calculations.\n4) Flames can damage Effects. This needs to be checked for.\n5) Static placeables are still unaffected.\n\nAlthough fully operational, I am still working on extra features as shown below:\n \n1) 'Extinguishing' creatures, such as Water Elementals will extinugish flames they come into contact with.\n2) Spells such as Gust Of Wind will destroy small flames, but may spread/fan larger blazes.\n3) More enhanced tileset functionality, checking for combustible architecture within the tile.\n4) Compatibility with Sunjammer's TileMagic and default TileMagic systems, allowing for the system to utilise the features of tiles altered.\n5) Torches, Flame-Weapons, Lightning, Doors all to be considered according to switches set.\n6) Spread across Area Transitions. The functionality for fire to spread from one area to another.\n7) Multiple Scorch-Marks to be optimised, grouped into large ones, or other suitable substitute.\n\nQuestions/Comments: PLEASE VOTE ON NWVAULT! \nLink\n\nI gratefully welcome (constructive) criticism and any comments!\nAlso, you may forward any queries to the Teutanis Project team:\nteutanis_support@ntlworld.com\n\nRegards,\nPJ","Rating":9.8,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"3311":{"Title":"Dynamic Armors","Author":"Vogar Eol","Submitted":20070502,"Updated":20070504,"Category":"Area","Expansions":"CEP-2.00 Requires Community Expansion Project","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Appearance","Description":"This is a work in progress.

As with a better Scribe Scroll (which is the basis for this), caster levels adjust as far as possible (I think) with neither a client-side hak/override nor a lot of scripting. Furthermore, this script is ready to implement true-level scribing, once someone makes the needed item properties available (or modifies every spell script).\n\nSo what does this package do? BioWare's script ignored a PC's caster level. This script does not. It makes the resulting potion, scroll, or wand as powerful as possible, without going over the PC's level (unless the weakest possible item is already over the PC's level, in which case the weakest possible is used).\n\nThere are limits, though. The caster levels available are limited to those found in iprp_spells.2da, so not every caster level is possible. To see what levels are available in BioWare's version of that file, download and read Item_levels.txt. Every spell & level combo listed in that file is a possibility with this script.\n\nIf you want to extend iprp_spells.2da to allow all (or more) possible caster levels, download and read Extended_levels.txt to see how to change the included .2da so that this scroll scribing system accesses your new item properties. There is still a bit of work involved, but this will save you from having to write a script.\n\nYes, this package contains a .2da, even though I said there would be no haks and no client-side overrides. This .2da only needs to go into the server's override directory; your players do not need it. Hak-free PW's can use this system.\n\n\nNew! There is now an item that will allow you to select the level at which a spell is brewed, scribed, or crafted. Use this item and target a potion, scroll, or wand before casting a spell. A dialog will appear in which you select the level at which you want the item to cast. Then, when you cast the spell, the item's caster level will be based on the lower of your caster level and the level selected via dialog.\n\nThis item requires tag-based scripting.\n\n\nPlayers: If you want to use this better Craft Magic in your single-player modules, download the \"PlayerOverride\" zip file and unzip its contents into your override directory.\n\nNew! Inside the .zip is another .zip called BCM_Leveler.zip. If you want to use the new level-selection item, unzip this file into your override directory. If you know how, you can now spawn the item using its blueprint: tk_cm_leveler. Otherwise, you can get the item through the mini-module I created called \"ITEM -- Level Setter\". To get this module, download BCM Level Module.zip and unzip that into your modules directory.\n\n\nBuilders: If you want to use this better Craft Magic in the module you're building, download and unzip the \"BuilderVersion\" zip file. Inside, there are two .erf files that get imported into your module, overwriting the standard BioWare resources x2_inc_craft and x2_pc_craft, and there's a .2da file that can either be packaged into a .hak or used as a server-side override (place it in the override directory the server will use). There is also a merge document that can be helpful if you have already customized the standard BioWare script x2_inc_craft.\n\nNew! There are now two .erf's in the builder's version. The first, CraftMagic_TK.erf, contains the new crafting scripts. (You need the new scripts if you want to use the level-selecting item.) The second, CM_Leveler_TK.erf, is optional, and contains what is needed for the level-selecting item. I'm keeping this separate so that there is less clutter if you don't want it. If you import it, you'll find the item, Level Setter, under the custom \"Crafting/Tradeskill Material\" items.\n\nBoth .erf's contain a copy of x2_inc_craft.nss for self-containedness. There is no difference between these versions.\n\n\nServer hosts: If you're hosting a module that you don't want to modify, the \"PlayerOverride\" version should work if it's unzipped into your server's override directory.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* With this system, crafted wands and scribed scrolls can only be used by the class that created them. Module builders can change this slightly to allow wizards and sorcerers to use each other's items by setting TK_WIZARD_SORCERER_SHARE to TRUE in x2_inc_craft then recompiling x2_pc_craft.\n\n* Whenever possible, items become their standard counterparts instead of generic versions (e.g. a \"Potion of Speed (5)\" instead of a \"Magic Potion: Haste (5)\"). If you have additional custom items available, you can cause them to be created by filling in the ResRef's in the appropriate columns in the .2da. (See the accompanying text file.)\n\n* On the flip side, replacing a ResRef in the .2da with \"****\" will not prevent the crafting of that item; a generic item will be produced in that case. If you need to change which spells can be brewed, scribed, or wandified, either asterisk-out the item property columns in the included .2da or change the associated entry in BioWare's des_crft_spells.2da.\n\n* Creating the .2da required significant data entry. I've verified a good chunk of it in-game, but the possibility of a typo still exists. If you find an error, please let me know.\n\n* One other thing I thought of... If you use this with a module that has custom spells, you can get weird results if you try to brew/scribe/craft the custom spells. Adding enough rows to the included .2da would fix this. (\"Enough rows\" = \"rows in your custom spells.2da\")\n\n\nUpdate 5/5: I was a little overzealous and commented out too many functions in x2_inc_craft. The updated builder version leaves CIGetIsCraftFeatBaseItem() alone. Mea culpa.\n\nUpdate 6/29: I added Level Setter, an item that lets you intentionally create items with a lower caster level.\n\nUpdate 9/20: Fixed a bug that appeared when players targeted a specific weapon with a scroll or wand casting a weapon-enhancing spell (e.g. Magic Weapon). The changed function is CIGetSpellWasUsedForItemCreation().\n\n\nOverride warning: It is unlikely that this override will cause problems, but it's always possible.

This should be long enough to discourage a player from sitting around waiting for the restock to kick in.\n\nOne reason to use this script is so that you can limit the availability of certain items (by not having them available in infinite quantities), while not giving an advantage to those who log in right after a server reset (and immediately buy those limited quantities).\n\nThe time before a restock, the chances of items appearing and disappearing, and the acceptable range of gold can be set for the module by changing the appropriate constants in this script.

I don't pretend this is a kickass do-it-all script. It contains a simple quest system designed to be easily altered and expanded on by module developers.\n\nA simple demo of the quest system is provided to allow module developers to see how a portion of how the code works in practice. There may be undocumented bugs at the time, which may be found during the play testing, so if you encounter any please leave comments so that I can get the script fixed ASAP.\n\nFeatures\n--------\nStrong documentation - Readme files and full script and custom object documentation are provided to assist the module developer at every turn.\n\nSimple implementation - By placing just a handful of objects in the game, and a few alterations to their tags and variables, quests can quickly be constructed and tested.\n\nSimple scripting - I've made an effort to simplify and explain how and why the code works. This is especially useful for any fledgling builders who might be otherwise confused.\n\nQuest completion methods - At the present time there are three ways in which a quest can be completed. Kill a custom creature, acquire a specially tagged item or reach a specific location. Once you're done head back to the quest giver and recieve you reward.\n\nLinked quests - The quest system can be set up so that the players are required to complete other quests before they can take another one with the inclusion of a single variable on the quest giver.\n\nQuest reseting - For the persistent world builders the quest state for players can be reset after so many real life hours allowing them to have a go at your quests over and over again. This feature can be turned off if you are developing a stand alone module.\n\nMissing features\n----------------\nDM Quest tracking - At the present time I've added no functionality for DMs to view which quest is currently active and who is on it. With the minor addition to the quest givers OnSpawn script, storing them as an object on the module, the developer can quickly add functionality to retrieve all important variables.\n\nQuest logging - No functionality has been added to log quests but the code is easily altered by developers to add this as and when they desire.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3363":{"Title":"Zunath's Structure System And Player Built Housing","Author":"Zunath","Submitted":20070805,"Updated":20080127,"Category":"Database Related","Expansions":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Player Property Tracking","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Zunath's Structure System\nCreated by Zunath\n\nRequirements for use:\n\n- NWNX set up for MySQL or SQLite use (refer to Link for installation instructions for NWNX)\n- CEP2\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis player housing system is designed to give the player more choices than what is found in other housing systems.\nThey are able to freely build their own houses, furniture, etc WITHOUT the need for a DM to intervene.

It includes a few features:\nStabbing in combat\nStabbing against wall\nStabbing onto spike on wall\nSecuring an enemy stabbed onto a spike in the wall with an item stabbed on after them.\n\nCombat stabbing\nWhen fighting monsters using the script that alows them to be stabbed in combat, after being attacked in pary mode a few times, they might fall temporarily and an object appear above them, when you click this object & have a weapon capable of stabbing, it will stab the weapon into the monster taking it from you & creating a placable version of it. The monster can struggle & try to escape aswell(which can unstap one weapon at a time). clicking on the placible weapon will take it our ot the monster & put the item back into your inventory. You can stab monsters multiple times this way to ensure they stay trapped longer.(this script also includes options to make the monster imortal &/or replicate when attacked w/out being in parry mode through the use of variables)\n\nWall stabbing\nwhen using wall stabbing, placibles must be placed along the walls to indicate the sections to which monsters can be stabbed. When a monster that can be wall stabbed is near on of these sections, you can click on the section of the wall that is stabbible to stab the monster into the wall. It is very simmilat to combat stabbing, however, the scripts are on the wall, not the monster, the monster can still attack if you get to close. You can still stab the monster multiple times however.(you cannot stab multiple monsters onto the same section of wall)\n\nSpike stabbing\nSpike stabbing also uses a placible in the wall, however in this case it is a spike sticking out of the wall. It has a narrower range than wall stabing but does not take away your weapon when you stab a monster to it. You cannot stab multiple monsters onto one spike, but you can wallstab a monster stabbed onto a spike(if there is stabbable wall on th section of wall the spike comes out of).\n\nSecuring spike stabbed monsters\nThere are also items that can be used to trap monsters perminantly onto spikes. When you find one & use it, if there is a spike in range it will stab it onto a spike, a spaike with one of these items on it cannot have anything stabbed onto it, not can anything already stabbed onto it get away. The item can be taken off of a spike by using it.\n\nThe download contains to versions of a demo mod, and a hak. The first version of the mod is the regular version which uses only the placibles in NWN, HotU, & SoU. The second version uses the Aged and Weathered Battlefield Placeables hak(included) by Tiberius_Morguhn and has different placibles for different weapon types. It should be noted that all these placibles are in the CEP 2.0 hackpack(though w/ different apperance numbers). The demo moda contain both a test area and a practicle use demo area(a zomby infested house).

A conversation where nodes fire only if certain prerequisites are met (the PC has a certain alignment, has a certain item, has done something special before...)? Then you may be aware of the problem that beset me:\n Each conversation node has several script slots: \"Text Appears When\" (a conditional for showing the node), and \"Actions Taken\" (upon choosing the node). Also, there are \"Current File: Normal/Aborted\", for behavior when conversation ends.\n It all comes to an awful lot of scripts. Deekin as a henchman, in SoU and HotU, is a good example of just how many special scripts that can be attached just to one conversation (take a look at this; we're talking a three-digit number!).\n The problem is the sheer number of scripts, as well as logistics (naming them in a comprehensive manner)! Builders with large worlds out there may dread the maximum number of scripts allowed in a module.\n PRCONV offers the following solution: Import this .erf (including 44 scripts), then utilise them over and over again, handling each conversation with ONE new script (albeit large and ungainly, sometimes).\n If you only use it one or two times in a module, or if your conversations are mostly informational and not meant to interact greatly with the PCs, you do not reap any benefit from PRCONV. It also takes some getting used to, I know.\n On the other hand, I could rewrite Deekin's dialogue (a pain, but if I really needed to, I could) to one script, and all new conversations similarily would become one script each.\n Download the \"prconv.txt\" for more information. The same information can be found at the end of the \"prconv_include\" library script.\n Update May 2009: Added a generic lists conversation (which I have used often). Added override for spellscript to TalkTo intelligent weapon (x2_s3_intitemtlk).

Ever been confused by your characters ability to take several hammer strikes to the head without suffering a concussion? Or, by how she shrugs off brutal axe swings as if they were bee stings? Or, by how an arrow that pierces her chest always seems to miss vital organs? Then this little system just might be for you!\n\n\nSYSTEM DETAILS\nOK, enough of the sales pitch, here's the nitty-gritty of what the system does:\n\nInjuries occur when attacks exceed a minimum damage of 10 (adjustable). Injuries occur at particular body parts and result in varying negative effects as outlined below.\n\nHead wound (10% chance)\n50% chance that wound is fatal, otherwise daze effect applied\nInstant death is optional \n\nChest wound (%30 chance)\n50% chance that chest wound is fatal, otherwise Con drops by 2 with no limit\nInstant death is optional \n\nRight arm wound (15% chance)\n33.33% chance that it disarms and prevents usage of an arm- the mangled effect\nReduces Dex by 1 to a max of 3\nIf mangled, max reduction is applied\n\nLeft arm wound (15% chance)\n33.33% chance that it disarms and prevents usage of an arm\nReduces Dex by 1 to a max of 3, if mangled then max reduction applied\n\nLeg wound (%30 chance)\nApplies slow effect and has a 33.33% chance of causing knockdown\n\nIn addition, hitpoints are conceptualized as representing stamina. Once half of a player or creature's hitpoints/stamina_points are gone, strength begins to drop (up to -3).\n\nInjuries persist until at least two successful rests, beyond this minimum the number of hours required is adjustable. Healing spells and potions have a chance of removing injuries, as outlined below:\n\nCure Moderate Wounds: 50% chance to remove injury\ncure Serious Wounds: 75% chance to remove injury\nCure Critical WOunds: 100% chance to remove injury\nHeal: Removes TWO injuries\n\n\nEFFECT ON COMBAT\nIn terms of combat balance, the system is largely invisible at low levels (6 or lower I'd wager) with injuries occuring infrequently due to low damage attacks and smaller hitpoint pools (characters die before more than 1 or 2 injuries). Once characters have greater strength or increased chances to crit or more powerful weapons, injuries occur much more frequently and battles are often decided by the distribution of injuries. The effects of this is too increase the importance of feats or spells that prevent damage by either incapacitating enemies (knockdown, stunning fist) or reducing the damage done (stoneskin, ghostly visage). Also, a lone warrior against multiple foes is at an even greater disadvantage with the injury system- she can no longer rely on her high hp pool or stock of healing potions to carry her through the fight and the more opponents there are the greater the chances of an injury or injuries that will cost her the fight. Overall, I feel this makes combat a bit more gritty and dangerous. No battle is routine, every blow has the potential to affect the player long after the battle is over. A final note, the system also increases the chance a low level character can overcome a higher level character, which I see has pushing the combat system a little closer to real combat.\n\n\nEFFECT ON ROLEPLAY\nIn terms of roleplay, I see the system as providing a great many opportunities for playing out the aftermath of battles. It forces the battles to have more of a story to them. Now, when recalling that battle with the Frost Giants of the Spine, your character can describe how she lost the use of her right arm and a leg but heriocally rallied to defeat them. There's also the tale of the horrendous journey after the battle. The desperate attempt to find the nearest settlement with a damaged leg. And there's even the bit about spending weeks in a small fishing village recovering. Sure, these stories could be easily created without the system, but now they're not optional and are determined to a greater extent by game experiences, easing the burden on the roleplayer to turn an adventure into an exciting tale. \n\nThe battles also invite greater immersion and heighten the drama. In my playtesting, it was hard to not be moved when watching my character and an enemy orc continue to battle though both could no longer hold a weapon. Nor could I ignore the sight of my exhausted character dragging himself away, exhausted and diminished by the terrible battle.\n\n\nCURRENTLY KNOWN SHORTCOMINGS\n- Spells that cause damage OnHit (like Elemental Shield or Acid Sheath) cause injuries to NPCs, but not PCs\n- Spells such as regeneration or feats like rage invalidate the damage calculations necessary for the injury system\n(current quick fix is an OnHeartbeat Old HP update)\n- If attacks occur nearly simultaneously, the damaged done by all simultaneous attacks is summed and treated as a single attack by the injury system. Injuries then occur when they shouldn't (Ex: damage1 = 5, damage2 =9, together they cause an \ninjury) or only one injury occurs when several should (Ex: damage1 =12, damage = 13, but only one injury occurs).\n\nGENERAL\nIncluded in the download is a demo module that will allow you to level a character at will and provides a simple mechanism for spawning enemies to try-out the injury system with. Please, feel free to post any comments, criticisms, suggestions, problems, questions, or beautiful praise to the vault.\n\nI'd like to acknowledge the great help that the Neverwinter Nights Lexicon provided and thank all the contributors (please see the Lexicon itself for a full listing).\n\n*Driller was kind enough to post an excellent sugestion for applying the injury system to PCs!*\n\nAlso, I'd like to point-out that the \"tired\" effect was inspired by Ossian Studios and is nearly identical to that used in Darkness over Daggerfall (a great module!).","Rating":9.25,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"3443":{"Title":"Pump of Oil.

Also, players never really have to worry about the long-term effects of fighting enemies...\n\nThey do now.\n\nThe Mexwolf Stamina System is a new beta-stage system designed to make that already wonderful journey that little bit more realistic. Your player will now get tired as he battles orcs in the forest, he will now wear down after throwing an all-nighter in the middle of the bitter-cold desert. And he will now have more reason to rest than to 'refill his spells' or 'refill his hitpoints'.\n\nUse this as you like, just keep in mind that this is a beta version, and any bugs should be reported post-haste.\n\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\nSetting up the system:\n\nPlace the following scripts in their appropriate slots-\n\nbase_stam_active - Module OnActivated\nbase_stam_enter - Module OnClientEnter\nbase_stam_resp - Module OnPlayerDeath\nbase_stam_rest - Module OnRest\nbase_stamlevelup - Module OnLevelUp\n\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\nFeatures:\n\nPlayers will be given a Max Stamina when the module begins, and during levelup. They will be set to this amount of stamina every time they rest whilst in possesion of food, levelup, wake up after passing out, or drink a refreshing potion.\n\nAs the player's stamina decreases below 10, their abilities will begin to suffer. Should it reach zero they will pass out for a while, before awakening with stamina replenished. They will also lose a small amount of experience for passing out, and will awaken with very low Hit Points.\n\nEvery minute or so (modifiable), the player will lose one stamina point under normal circumstances. They will lose stamina much faster in combat.\n\nYou can equip NPC's with special tranquiliser rounds. A player who is struck with one or more of these will lose stamina at an alarming rate according to the number. Should the character be hit by ten in a row without getting rid of them, they will suffer an overdose, taking large amounts of damage and greatly reducing their stamina.\n\nThere are three ways to deal with tranquilisers: Digging them out with a knife, drinking antitoxin, or using a refreshing potion. Until one of these actions is taken, or the effects of the tranq wear off, the player will keep losing stamina.\n\nThe stamina count of a player is not shown regularly, they will only be notified when their stamina drops below 10, or they use the specialised 'stamina counter'.\n\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\nNOTES:\n\nThis is the beta edition of my system, there may still be a few bugs.\n\nThis is not for use in PW's, as it uses a continuous heartbeat script.

It has TONS of commands you can use. After the DM types something and enters it, the text doesn�t appear above the DM�s head at all. This can be mainly used to manipulate NPCs, causing them to say things and do things, though it has so many other features.\n\nIt works by storing a �reference character� (or �reference char� or 'ref char') on the DM, a single-character letter or number or even symbol (except a period, which is a special symbol) which represents an object in the game world. The exclamation point (�!�) is always used to reference to yourself (the DM- you aren't allowed to reference other DM's in the game though).\n\nTo use a command, type it in with �dm� at the front. For example, �dmsay.x.What�s up!� will make the object stored as �x� say �What�s up!�\n\nMany commands have many uses and parameters to do many things with them, it�s not just one use per command. This is a whole language! The thing is, it�s easy to learn!\n\nHere is the list of commands. If there is a comma next to it, it means that will also do the same thing:\n\nset\nsay, s\ntalk, t\nname, rename\ndesc, describe\nsubrace, srace\nsave, sv, store\nget, getvar\ngo, port, teleport, jump\nwalk, walkto, goto\nexport\nq, queue\ninfo, data\nblank, del, delete\ncopy, transfer, xfer\nswitch, swap\ne, emote, anim\natk, attack\nbtl, start, fight, combat, battle\nxp, exp\nparty, p\npin, mappin\nmap, ap, area\nboot\nend\nabort\nlog, write, file\nturn\nmove, ove\n\nThe next page will describe each command and how to use them.\n\n***\n\nif you run into any problems, don't vote me down or flame me or anything, like I said, this is untested\n\nthanks,\nThaladar9 :D","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3472":{"Title":"Flash Mail System","Author":"Flash-B","Submitted":20080520,"Updated":20080521,"Category":"Conversation","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Conversations","Description":"Based on Dakon's notes writing system.\n\nUses the writing system but adds a Post Office element where you can now send and receive the letters between players.

There is also a demo module called Killer Caravan Quest v1_1 Demo.mod included in the zip file (put it into your /modules folder to try it out). Installing the system into your module will give you the ability to add a caravan escort quest system where players can talk to caravan master NPCs to get quests requiring them to escort a caravan and deliver it safely to another caravan master NPC at some other location for an XP and/or GP reward.\n\n Version 1.1:\n Updated to be compatible with NWN v1.69. The only thing that needed changes for this was the demo module to support horses -- even though the demo module has no horses in it, if you want to add them it will work. It also serves as a good example of how to set up your module to work with KCQ and v1.69 horses. The instructions for using the OnClientEnter script have changed however so read section D of the Readme file to ensure you are integrating your OCE script correctly to support the v1.69 horse system.\n \n Changed the caravan master's conversation to say \"coin\" instead of \"cash\" to better match the D&D setting terminology.\n \n Added 2 functions to the _kcq_inc library to allow builders to easily customize the town names that appear in the caravan master's list of destination towns the player chooses from and the other dialog lines that the NPC speaks where the town name appears rather than using the name assigned to each caravan area there (see Section IV-C2d in the Readme file).\n \n Fixed the caravan creatures so they will properly utilize the Bioware walk waypoints system to stand posts or follow patrol routes when they are dropped off at a caravan master or not being escorted and there are appropriate POST_*, NIGHT_*, WP_* &/or WN_* waypoints nearby. Note that they will not cross areas to run thier route even if the patrol routes and the module are set up for that. They will only utilize the waypoints present in the area where they are dropped off, abandonded, or spawned.\n\n\nI. Requirements.\n-----------------\nKiller Caravan Quest System should work with any expansion pack combination including no expansion packs, but you need to patch your game up to v1.68 or later to use this package.

It is offen much more useful to be running about as a \"mortal\" character. Thus Tink, the DM listener, was created. She gives us access to some of the more useful DM client commands while logged in as a normal player. \n\nTink is a \"listener\". A creature that \"listens\" to everything you speak out loud and reacts to certain, pre-programmed, phrases. So you can be anywhere in game and Tink can execute a command on a player without you being close enough to aim an item at them. They can be on a completely different map and as long as you spell their character name correctly, Tink can find them. For us, this is a *huge* improvement over an item that you have to be close enough to aim at a player for it to work.\n\nDetailed instructions for use included and the scripts are well documented. \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nShe has been trained to \"listen\" for the following commands:\nTink control options:\n- tink listen: Tell her to start listening to you.\n- tink stop: Tell her to stop listening to you.\n- tink bye: Tell her to go away.\n- tink follow: Tell her to follow you or stop following you.\n- tink help: Tell her to display a list of all the commands she will respond to.\n\nCreation options:\n- item: Create an item in your inventory.

DM Functions:\n- hour: Advance time in hours.\n\nEach command has built in help. Simply type the command (for example: give xp) in without any variables and Tink will explain how to use it.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nCredits and Honors\n\nThere are two people in particular that we need to thank and give credit for. Without them, Tink wouldn't exist.\n\nFirst is Nereng, a great guy and (to us) the leading vault expert on listeners. If you haven't seen his \"The Invisible Listener v2.0\" package it is spectacular.\n\nLink\n\nSecond is Sir Elric, whom we have never met but his \"Sir Elric's Verbal Mob Spawner v1.1\" provided the foundation for Tink. Her \"spawn\" command was the first thing Tink learned how to do and the list rapidly expanded from there.\n\nLink\n\nWe used CFBMoo1's DM Tools 2.0 as a foundation for the GetClassName function. That converts the CLASS_TYPE_* constant into the readable class name.\n\nLink\n\n\nWe used Beta Testers Toolkit v1.3 by DnC Team as a foundation for the GiveLevelToPlayer function. That gives the player enough XP to level ONE level.\n\nLink\n\nWe referenced the time functions in the DMFI for the AdvanceTimeByHour function.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nHow to use:\n\nAssumption: You have tag based item activation enabled.\n\n1. Import i_dm_tink.erf into your module file\n2. Edit the l_tink_funcs script.\n - locate the is_a_DM function - starts on line 89\n - You *MUST* add the login ID and public CD key for EACH login ID you want Tink to listen to. This is the *only* thing that keeps her from responding to anyone. You don't (typically) want your players to be able to give themselves unlimited gold and xp.\n - Follow the directions that start on line 113 to add in the login ids.\n - If you skip this step, Tink WILL NOT WORK. At all.\n3. Compile the scripts. If you skip this step, Tink WILL NOT WORK. At all.\n4. Run the module in game and have fun seeing what Tink can do. Use \"Tink's Bottle\" on the ground at your feet to spawn up Tink. It takes a couple seconds after she appears at your side for her to start listening to your voice commands.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nUpdates:\n6-1-08 - Removed account information from screenshot.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3478":{"Title":"Ultima VII Era Moongates and Orb of the Moons for 169 & CEP ","Author":"Carcerian @ Ultima Restoration","Submitted":20080601,"Updated":20090215,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"HOTU-1.69","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Portals","Forums":"Link","Description":"A Moongate system for the Ultima 7 Era.\n\nIncludes The Orb of the Moons.\n\nScripts use XP2 switches.\n\nDemo requires 1.69 or CEP 2.2\n\nLocal Variables : \n\nCOLOR = 0 BLUE, 1 RED\nDECAY = 0 FALSE, 1 TRUE\nDEST = Waypoint's Tag\n\nMoongates will teleport everyone in the users party to their destination.\n\nMoongates are Transparent, have a red or blue aura, and emit colored light in a 20' radius.\n\nThe Orb of the Moons will spawn a portal on the ground, its destination determined by NSEW location of target location in relation to the user, if a point on the ground is too close or far it spawns a bad Moongate, that inflicts damage, knockdown and screenshake upon use.\n\nIncludes :\n\nBlue Stone Circle Moongates that randomly teleport to another circle.\n\nRed or Blue Moongates for dungeon use, that use localstring DEST tag or \"WP_\"+Tag as thier destination.\n\nSee _moongate_inc for details\n\nUpdated : CEP v2.2 version added\n\nEnjoy!","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3479":{"Title":"Updated d20 bleeding system","Author":"Gulfwulf","Submitted":20080602,"Updated":20080604,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"Custom","Description":"This is an updated d20 bleeding system similiar to the system HABD uses, but without the overhead (and database capabilities.

The old listener and voice system has been extensively overhauled, and users should find the listener-based features perform much more smoothly now.\n\nThere is also a new DMFI Naming Wand that lets you alter the name and description of NPC's, items, and placeables. And there is now experimental support for Knat's NBDE system for the DMFI persistence routines.\n\nOther Information(from the notes of the previous 1.08alpha release):\n\nThis package allows DMs to create over 1000 actions/effects/sounds etc. that you just can't do without extra scripting.

Most recent and final version now available on NWVault rather than private download. \n\nChanges from v1.07: \n* Updated the Custom Encounters \n* Activating the Voice Widget or any of the language widgets now jumps the Voice to the activator, rather than destroying and creating a new Voice. They will still create a new Voice when necessary. \n* 1 File added: Added wrapper functions for the persistent variables. They are in a new include, dmfi_db_inc, and will allow advanced users to choose what sort of database they wish to use to store DMFI variables. The default is still the Bioware database. \n* Added to DMFI NPC Control Wand: New option for Toggle Bioware Encounters in Area. \n* Changed the DMFI DM Wand: Added new Jail function and changed the Penguin function to be a toggle. \n* Added a new widget: DMFI Destroy Object Widget. This allows you to quickly destroy small groups of objects, a single object, or a placeable near your avatar. \n* Added a new widget: DMFI Jail Widget. This dumps a targeted offender into a \"Jail\" area. \n* Added 9 Custom Languages, plus the ability to easily add hundreds of unique languages. \n* Replaced Report XP/Gold with Full Player Report, which gives the old DM wand listing of inventory and stats. \n* Added a DMFI Resting System Alpha.

It works with the creature's onpreception event in the scripts tab in the creature properties and the faction that creature is a part of. To make it work correctly the faction must be hostile towards the player to begin with. Once the item tag is acquired by the script that creature and the faction of that creature becomes friendly towards that player. Factions can be edited within the faction editor tool within the NWN toolset. If a player does not have the item with that tag then that faction and those creatures within that faction stay hostile towards that player. Pick up one of the test items numbered one through four. One will be friendly to you the other three will become hostile.

This package fixes that, for all versions of CEP up to 2.1.\n\nNOTE: This package is CEP-aware, but it does not require CEP at all, much less a particular version of it. That's right -- if you want to, you can use this with a non-CEP module. (Why would you want to? Not sure. Maybe for the few small bug fixes.) That being said, if a non-CEP module infringes upon CEP \"space\", there could be a few odd side-effects, but I think those would be few, minor, and far between.\n\nInstallation is fairly standard. If you want details, see the text document below. There are both override (for single-player) and import (for builders) versions, and you have your choice of .7z or .zip formats. That makes four options, so choose the one that's right for you.\n\nExamples of what this package allows:\n\n1) Flame weapon (and similar spells) can be cast on mauls (and other CEP weapons).\n\n2) Bone medusas (and other CEP skeletal creatures) join the BioWare skeletal creatures in the \"immune to petrification\" club.\n\n3) Flame weapon (and similar spells) can be cast on all creatures that have a single creature weapon, regardless of which slot it is in. (Bug fix -- BioWare's version missed one of the three creature weapon slots.)\n\n\nSpells affected:\nDaze, flesh to stone, Tasha's hideous laughter, blackstaff, blade thirst, bless weapon, darkfire, deafening clang, flame weapon, greater magic weapon, holy sword, keen edge, and magic weapon.\n\nOther affected abilities:\nPetrification breath, petrification gaze, petrification touch, alchemist's fire, caltrops, beholder rays, petrification gaze (shifter), and poison weapon.\n\n\nA list of files in the override version can be found in the text document below.\n\nI created this under NWN 1.69.

And it won't work before time passes!\n- And mainly: It's only one script at all. Even no include file.\n\nHow it works?\nI made this changes in 2das:\n1) I create new HIPS feat, useable unlimited times per day and running this script\n2) I replaced Shadow Dancer's HIPS feat for my version and added it to SD's radial menu.\n3) I created my HIPS remake as bonus feat and replaced it for standart HIPS in Cobold Commando's Sword\n4) I added HIPS remake to shifter's radial menu.\n\nAnd then when you use my HIPS feat:\nIt works almost the same as Hide Mode, but if SD didn't used HIPS in 30 second it allow SD to hide herself even while being observed. Just like standart HIPS. If he did, then he hide herself like he used Hide Mode.\n\nTechnically:\nDelay is stored on module and deleted by module, so player can relog and it will still work. If player is not in hide mode, hide mode is activated. If he is, hide mode is deactivated. If delay passed and SD use this feat, then he get a temporary bonus feat HIPS for 0.1 second before hide mode is activated so it works like standart HIPS but there is no way to spam it.\n\nPlease note, this is how it work for windows version.

The override version gets decompressed into your override directory. The import version is only for builders (and gets decompressed into your erf directory, then imported into your module). There are .zip and .7z options for downloading; you only need one. (To get in on the 7-zip smaller-download party, go to www.7-zip.org.)\n\nThe current release is really a beta test. This is a big project, and I've barely checked the basic functionality (mount, dismount, and summon paladin mount). Bug reports (and suggestions for improvement) are welcome.\n\nA detailed list of changes is in the text file available below. Some highlights:\n\n1) Improved (hopefully) mounting and dismounting animations. (There are still a few glitches, but most of the time I think they look better.)\n\n2) The \"PC Properties\" item only gets created when it is really needed. (If it gets created when casting any spell, please let me know.)\n\n3) Database functions and mounting effects have been moved into separate scripts for easier editing.\n\n4) \"Skin variables\" can be stored on a different item, which can be useful on server-vault persistent worlds.\n\n5) Modules using these scripts can support the taking of (ridden) horses between modules, if they want to.\n\n6) Saddlebag database storage (regrettably) is not compatible with BioWare's version, but it does allow for items that have been modified from their blueprint.\n\n\nThe BioWare scripts are the basis for this project. That means two things. First, this is not all my work; I rewrote every horse script I could find, but some functions got little more than a reformat. Second, scripts written to work with the BioWare horses should continue to work -- with the exception of those calling the function HorseCreateHorse() -- but will need to be recompiled.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3525":{"Title":"Custom Magic Items (Variable Based)","Author":"Carcerian","Submitted":20080828,"Updated":20080830,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"HOTU-1.69","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type -

There are also other improvements, see the version notes for details. We are now nearly out of beta for the SP version, so now I expect to start work on the Knat's db version before christmas!\n\nBETA! This system is very much a work in progress! I am offering it up to anyone interested in helping out, in hopes of getting valuable feedback from beginners and experienced builders alike. Anyone helping out with this can expect to get their names on the credits-list of the final product, and anyone can help, no matter how little or much they know about scripting and using the toolset. Just letting me know what parts of the tutorial you had problems with will be helpful enough. I'll also appreciate help with testing for possible exploits and other types of bugs, and for that matter with proofreading of the tutorials and Readme. Any kind of feedback, really!\n\nThis is a system for making quests without the need for any kind of scripting knowledge on the part of the builder at all. All the scripting has been done for you already! If you can read and write, then you can use this!\n\nIt works by putting \"tokens\" (little misc items) in the inventory of the NPC you want to be a questgiver. The OnConversation script on the NPC detects the token(s) when someone tries to talk to the NPC, and starts the special quest-conversation that is associated with that token.\n\nThe builder must write variables on the tokens. First of all, the tag of this particular quest. (It's the same tag as used by the journal editor.) Then he must write the actual conversation strings to be used in the conversation, and some facts like how much xp and gold to hand out as reward, number of items (in the case of a fetch quest or courier-quest), number of kills (in a kill-quest), etc. I have tried to make it so that there are no more variables to write than fills one page of the Variables-tab.\n\nA number of things happen automatically. If there's a map pin with the quest-tag + \"_PIN\" it is activated automatically, if there's an encounter with a tag of quest-tag + \"_ENCOUNTER\" similarly, if there's a key in the inventory of the quest-giver with tag of quest-tag + \"_KEY\", the PC gets it at the start of the quest. And so on and so forth!\n\nWhen the quest is done, the token is destroyed and the NPC will revert to using his own conversation. Unless there is another token in his inventory! Then he has another quest that needs to be done!\n\nThe whole idea behind this is to make a system that can be used by the greenest newbie who just can't wrap his mind around scripting. If you're not one of those, then you're probably better off using something else! At least for now. Maybe when the system has matured it will become something useful for more experienced builders when they just need to throw in some side-quests in a hurry.\n\nLink to Guild: The No Scripting Guild \n\nCheers!

The package contains an erf file containing the one and only script required (an include library), three 2da template files used as a baseline for creating the 2da defintion files that drive the system, and three documentation text files. The documentation files are:KIS Readme.txt --> overview, concepts, mechanics, requirements.\nKIS How To.txt --> step by step instructions for setting up and using KIS v1.0 in a module. Also includes a section detailing some caveats and warnings worth reviewing and contemplating when designing an itemset for use in a KIS enabled module.\nKIS Examples And Patterns.txt --> a file containing concrete examples and explanations of the KIS system in action.\nI. Requirements.\n-----------------\nKiller Item Sets should work with any expansion pack combination including no expansion packs, but you need to patch your game up to v1.69 or later to use this package. The KIS system is compatible with all custom content you choose to add to your module including CEP, PRC, CRAP, CTP, and any other letter combinations you stumble across.\n\n \nII. KIS Concepts\n-----------------\nWhat is an itemset? Basically, it is a set of related equipment items that grant additional bonuses beyond what they give normally to the wearer when combinations of the items in the set are equipped at the same time. In KIS a \"full\" itemset is one where special items are associated with the set for every possible (non-creature) equipment slot available to the players. So a \"full\" set would include:A Helmet or hat worn in the head slot\nAn Armor or Clothing item worn in the chest slot\nA pair of Boots or footware worn in the boots slot\nA set of Bracers, Gauntlets, or Gloves worn in the arms slot\nTwo items that can be carried (i.e. wands, weapons, shields, torches, etc) equippable in the lefthand/righthand slot(s).\nA cloak or cape worn in the cloak slot\nTwo rings worn in the leftring/rightright slot(s).\nAn Amulet or necklace worn in the neck slot\nA belt worn in the belt slot\nA quiver of arrows equipped in the arrow ammo slot\nA bag of bullets or other throwable ammo like shuriken equipped in the bullet ammo slot\nA quiver of bolts equipped in the bolt ammo slotbringing the maximum size of a full set to 14 items. Itemsets need not be full sets and typically are not, however all itemsets must have at least two items in them.\n\nIn KIS bonuses for itemsets are applied based on a two-item combination scheme. Each item in the set will grant one or two bonuses for each combination with the other items in the set that are equipped at the time. For example, a set with helm, boots and bracers defined will grant one or two bonuses when the helm is worn with the boots, another one or two when the helm is worn with the bracers, and another one or two when the boots are worn with the bracers. Wearing two of the three items from the set will give the wearer one or two bonuses. Put on the third item, and they will have one to six extra bonuses applied. The bonuses awarded by the itemset are defined by these two-item combinations. You define the one or two bonuses that will apply for each item in the set when it is worn in combination with each of the other items in the set. So, in a full set, with two bonuses defined for every possible two-item combination, this will give a maximum of 182 different additional bonuses to players equipping the entire set. That should be PLENTY. To compute this maximum bonus number you can use the formula:\n \n max #of bonuses possible = (#items in the set) * ((#items in the set) -1)\n\nwhich might be a useful thing to know when figuring out how big an itemset will or should be.\n\nAlthough the two-item combo scheme invented for KIS is quite flexible for creating itemsets, there are drawbacks to it that should be considered. For example, there is no way to specify a bonus that only gets applied when more than two items from a set are equipped at once. Supporting a feature like that in this design would have required far too many 2DA files to be practical so it was left out. If those are the kinds of itemsets you want, you should go with another system.\n\n\nIII. User's Guide.\n-------------------\nThe documentation files included describe all the details you will need to know about in order to install, configure, and operate KIS in your modules.\n\n\n-- Added a builder's utility to help automate the process of creating the 2da files that drive the system.\n\nUPDATE NOTE:\nThe package was updated with a new version of the itemset maker utility on 1/8/2009 to fix a couple of minor bugs (i.e. crash at startup and the program confusing the amulet and belt slots). I didn't deem it serious enough to create a whole v1.1 so if you got the download before the 8th, get it again so you're running the most recent itemset maker utility. The only thing that was changed was the itemset maker program.\n","Rating":9.58,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"3567":{"Title":"Item property scripting tools","Author":"hohos","Submitted":20081220,"Updated":20081221,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Description":"Several functions that help for working with item properties.

The item will\ngive one of the witnesses the command to run to where the 5th witness and guard\nare standing then to run back to the original position. Once the witness returns\nyou can run north again, and the guard should attack you. The message of the crime\nobserved has been transferred from the witness who ran north to the witness who\nis standing next to the guard.\n","Rating":9.5,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"3584":{"Title":"[Deleted]","Author":"Deleted","Submitted":20090207,"Updated":20091216,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"NWN-1.18","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Deleted","Rating":"N/A","Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"3585":{"Title":"MDF's Persistent Player Positioning widget","Author":"Mad Dog Fargo","Submitted":20090208,"Updated":20090208,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Requires Both Expansions (SoU & HotU)","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Location Tracking","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"Don't know if anyone has submitted a tool like this, but it allows us to quickly/easily pickup where we left off after a server reset.\n\nAttached ERF should include a custom item \"You Are Here\", and the associated conversation opener script, conversation file, and save DB / jump to DB location scripts.\n\nDefault config assumes NBDE is included in your module and that you are using a tag-based OnActivation module script that pulls the tag of the last activated item and runs a script of the same name.

New login, because I forgot the information for the old one)\n\nThe following is a library of player chat commands that have been added to the game via a set of scripts.\n\nFor a detailed list of all the commands as well as installation instructions, click on this Link\n\nThe system is very easy to implement. It consists of the core scripts and then the scripts for the commands broken up into groups. Each group of commands is designed to function independently from the others, so you may add the ones that you want and leave out the ones you don't. You may choose to import the entire library or each group one by one (Done this way because some servers may not want the adult sexual content). The system has also been designed for easy patching so I can constantly add new commands. See the HTML file in the rar or click the Link above for in depth instructions and explanation.\n\nAll commands have the same basic structure:\n/<PrimaryCommand> <SecondaryCommand>\n\nAll commands are routed to Silent Talk channel and instantly fire an action or event.\n\nUnlike other player chat command systems, the command must be entered seperate from any other emote text and will not fire any code without the / proceeding the commands. This keeps annoying misfires of emotes and voice chats from happening.\n\nThe commands are broken down into the following groups:\nEMOTES - Player will perform an animation\nHUGGING AND KISSING - Player will hug/kiss the nearest player\nWALKING - Toggles walking mode on/off\nTOUCHING - Toggles touching mode on/off\nLAP SITTING - Player will sit in the lap of the nearest person\nDESCRIPTION MODIFICATION - Allows the player to save, load, modify, delete and reset his/her description.\nITEM MODIFICATION - Allows the player to save, load, modify, delete, and rest the name and/or description of a selected item. Also allows them to create Blank Notes so they may create letters to give to other players.\nJOURNAL - Creates a personal Player Journal item for the player and allows them to update it with dated entries\nASSOCIATE SPEAK - Allows player to speak through his familiar, animal companion, summoned creature, dominanted creature/player, or henchmen\nASSOCIATE CONTROL - Allows the player to change the name, toggle stealth mode or toggle detect mode of familiars, animal companions, or summoned creatures.\nDICE ROLLS - Allows the players to perform a variety of dice, ability and saving throw rolls that are public displayed -\nEYES - Allows the player to add glowing eyes to their character until they rest\nCHARACTER MODIFICATION - Change the head, tail or wings of a player to the 2da number entered\nPLAYER LOCATER - Displays a list of non-anonymous player names, logins, and location\nWEAPON VISUAL EFFECT - Add a visual effect to the player's primary weapon\nSEXUAL POSITION - Player will get in a variety of sexual positions with the nearest person\nMISC - Commands for exporting character, commiting suicide, removing buffs, and stopping all actions/animations\nVOICE CHAT - Player will speak a voice chat\n\nA complete list of the commands for each group and what they do can be found by clicking the Link above or in the HTML file included in the RAR file. A book is included in game for players to reference.\n\nThere is several advantages of using this system over the more traditional systems of conversations on Rest and via Activate Items...\n- Only the code that is relevant to the text command that is entered is fired and nothing else. This causes considerably less lag then Rest or On Activate Item fired conversations.\n- On laggy servers, it can take several minutes to scroll through an entire conversation to find one action to fire. In this system, one command is entered and the action is immediately performed.\n- Players will be able to create custom buttons for their quick bar with macros\n\nYou may email me at mad_rabbit_land@hotmail.com with bug reports and suggestions for improvements.

It is a collection of systems all merged into one complete system that can be easily modified and controled via one script with no knowledge of code. (Script name is \"rp_global\". I suggest looking at it first to get a full idea of the degree the system can be customized to)\n\nThis module engine is geared towards creating an immersive Roleplaying World and NOT geared towards PvP or PvM. \n\nNor is this the end all be all of PW starter kits. I am not trying to produce a massively complex system of core scripts with everything plus the kitchen sink. It's built using my style and philosophy of coding. \"Getting the most out of simplicity.\"\n\nIn this engine, I am attempting to create a balance between realistic, immersive roleplaying systems and low lag generating code that is easy on the hardware. There is one heartbeat script used, the module heartbeat and it has been carefully designed. The entire engine uses one campaign variable.\n\nThe following is a list of everything included in the core scripts. Each part can be disabled and customized. Go to this Link for indepth explanation of each system and instructions for installing. \n\nPERSISTANT TIME - Calender is saved periodically and loaded when the module first starts.\nGLOBAL WEATHER - Creates a global wide season based weather system as opposed to different weather in every area.\nAREA SPAWN AND CLEAN - This is not designed for instantizing challenging PvM encounters, but rather instantizing an entire area of individual placeables, creatures, traps, and items via use of waypoints and then cleaning it when the area is empty of players. Variables on the waypoints can be modified to customize the object on spawn. Hence, four different creatures can created from one blueprint. \nPLAYER DEATH AND RESPAWN SYSTEM - Designed to be customizable with two different default modes and a third mode for custom respawn scripts.\nCAMPSITE RESTING SYSTEM - Players are restricted to only resting in resting zones and within ten feet of a lit campfire. Bioware default resting system will be used when disabled.\nHUNGER AND THIRST SYSTEM - Players are checked automatically every six hours for food and drink and automatically consumed. Players suffer penalities that get worse over time when they run out of food and drink. Players may purchase food and drink, fill up bottles at wells, hunt and fish for meat to be cooked, and pick berries from bushes.\nFATIGUE SYSTEM - Players become fatigued if they do not rest regularly and suffer penalties that grow worse until they rest. Checks are every six hours. Length of time a player can go without resting is based off a base number of hours plus their CON bonus.\nRACIAL ARMOR ENCUMBRANCE SYSTEM - Players suffer penalties to movement speed based upon race when wearing medium or heavy armor.\nSPELL COMPONENT SYSTEM - Allows the module designer to associate a spell component with a specific spell. One component is consumed when the spell is cast. \nPLAYER CHAT COMMANDS AND EMOTES - I have included my player chat command system as well. Information about it can be found at this Link\nPW HOUSING - Included my PW Housing System. Details can be found at this Link and instructions at this Link\nMISC FEATURES - Lightable campfires, torches that burn out, placeable street lights that consume fuel when lit and burn out, chairs that have a small chance of breaking when sat in, and doors that automatically close.\nPLUS a few other settings for customizing the game.\n\nEverything has been tested extensively within reason and verified that it works with the exception of minor bugs. Yes, there will be minor bugs in anything this ambitious.\n\nYou may email me bug reports and suggestions for improvement at mad_rabbit_land@hotmail.com, but I only do custom work for the servers I play on.\n\nEnjoy and please vote in return for downloading the software.\n\nCREDITS\nIcey's Global Weather system provided the foundation for more advanced system.

Each housing district has an unique list of exterior and interior areas.\n\nThe exterior and interior areas are not connected. Instead, when the door to the exterior of the house is unlocked, the system searchs through all interior areas belonging to that district for one not being used by any players and connects that interior area to the exterior. When players vacate the interior area and lock the door, the connection is broken, leaving the interior area free to be used by other players accessing their homes.\n\nThis allows, for example, 5 interior areas to service 50 exterior homes.\n\nExterior homes consist of nothing more than a door and a house sign. Therefore, it is possible to create all the exterior homes of one district in one large area.\n\nSee this Link for details and full instructions on how the system works.\n\nWhen the module loads, the system will perform upkeep on the housing database. The upkeep takes 20 seconds and significant lag can be generated in this time if their is a large number of houses. An expiration date may be configured for the houses so any houses not used within the expiration date will be recycled and placed back on the market for sale.\n\nEach exterior home created uses one variable in the BioWare database. An addition variable is used for storing persistant time.\n\nPlayer chat commands are available that allow DMs to reset the entire housing database and players to remove any no drop house keys for expired homes.\n\nEach district has a housing list sign that lists the ownership and availability of all houses in the district along with who owns which house.\n\nThe system may be configured to load all or parts of the database into the host's memory. This causes the housing system to generate lass lag spikes from slow reading of the hard drive.\n\nMy public email is mad_rabbit_land@hotmail.com for bug reports and suggestions for improvements.\n\nThe system has been tested extensively in single and multiplayer settings but minor bugs may still exist.\n\nEnjoy and please vote in return for downloading.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3605":{"Title":"MadRabbit's Meta Channel","Author":"MadRabbit","Submitted":20090402,"Updated":20090402,"Category":"Area","Expansions":"HOTU-1.69","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"Custom","Description":"This script set is still in BETA, because it hasnt been fully tested in a multiplayer setting.

It has proven to be quite useful, so maybe someone can use it too.\n\nIt is NOT fully completed for now - but I can't work on it at this moment, because I am struggling to get up other server and dont have too much time. Thats why I have decided to relase it now. It has some flaws, but is functional and can be a tool for DMs that like to create more complicated sceneries (personally I hated when server crash ruined about hour of work :) ) .\n\nWhat can it do?... It can save placeables in choosen area. Or destroy those... or restore previously saved. Allows DM to prepare scenery for his quest, then restore it or change in a few seconds. \n\nHow does it work? To be short - before you begin to place your decorations, use \"preparing area\" - this option will mark all placeables as \"not to be saved\". After this, place what you wish, then use \"save\" - and everything you placed after area preparation will be stored in database. You can now restore it at any moment.\nUse wand of object manipulation for adding/removing single objects - just use it on choosen wand of placeables then select object and what you want to do with it.\n\nWands are distinguished by name, so you either must have means of changing this name in game, or prepare wands with choosen names before logging onto the server. Once DM saves some decorations, this wand \"belongs\" to him/her. Everyone can restore placeables saved in this wand, but only DM that has created it can change or delete decorations placed in it.\n\n\n\nIf you want to get familiar with system:\n\n1. I recommend making separate database for testing - if you can't, just delete 'asp_placeables' and 'asp_placeables_data' after.\n2. Import wandplacdemo.sql to your database\n3. Run the test module. On the ground are six wands of placeables - 3 numbered (empty) and 3 named (garden, shambles and evil ritual) that have some decorations saved. Select \"instructions\" for basic information on how to use them. Try to restore decorations from named wands, then use numbered ones to get more familiar with their usage.\n\n\n\nTo import the wand to your module:\n\n1. Import the erf. You will get information about missing aps_include - ignore it (you should have it in your module already). \n2.Integrate asp_on_activate with your existing OnActivate script. \n3. Re-compile all scripts.\n\n4. Create tables in database:\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `asp_placeables` (\n `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,\n `dmlogin` varchar(255) default NULL,\n `wandname` varchar(255) default NULL,\n `lastused` date default NULL,\n PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\n\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `asp_placeables_data` (\n `id` int(11) default NULL,\n `area` varchar(32) default NULL,\n `coord` varchar(32) default NULL,\n `resref` varchar(16) default NULL,\n KEY `id` (`id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\n\nAnd it should work from now.\n\nImportant: System is designed to use standard aps_include and MySQL database. I did not test it on other databases.\n\nWand will save no more than 100 placeables and will give a warning if more than 50 are saved - too much of them can quite often crash the server...","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3619":{"Title":"pStr","Author":"Peter Fryxelius","Submitted":20090518,"Updated":20090731,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"HOTU-1.69","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Daily Routine","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Peter's String functions, v.004\n\nSome string handling function I find helpful.

Other systems where too demanding for our world.Though the bedroll and food ration systems were a\nnice touch, they were also inadequate. After talking to the players of DoN and\nlistening to the Bioware forums, I decided to come up with our own system that \nwas flexible, simple, and easy to use.\n\nHere is what the system does.\n\n1. Players can now rest (up to 3 times) with out sleeping. They will not need \na bedroll, tent, or a safe zone (like an inn or campsite) to rest. This option\nwill only regain spells for the players and no hit points. Since HP is restored\nby the game engine, I had to put in a script to restore the players HP to what \nit was before he rested.\n\n2. Players can rest in safe zones created when the builder paints down a trigger\n(called Save Zone, listed under custom 1 Triggers) in an Inn or around a campsite.\nThis safe zone will allow the player to rest with out the use of rations, bedroll,\nor a tent. It will fully heal and restore spells for the player. It will also \nreset the rest counter for the prior option of resting.\n\n3. If the Player has a Bedroll and a Ration, he will have the option to use it or\nthe regular rest described in 1. When the player uses the Bedroll, he will regain\nall spells and partial HP (he will gain half of what his current hp was). It will\nalso reset the rest counter.\n\n4. If the player has a Tent and a Ration, he will have the option of using the \nregular rest or the tent. When the player uses the Tent, he will regain all HP\nand spells. It will also reset the rest counter.\n\n5. The system will not allow rest if a creature is too close.\n\n6. It will not allow rest if some one is mounted.\n\n7. It has a two rest counters. The first rest counter is described in the standard \nrest. The second is a counter for the entire system. It is set up that a player can\nonly rest every 10 minutes Real Time. If the player has not met the 10 minute re-,\nquirement, the player can not rest. The standard rest (no sleep) is not tied into \nthe rest time so the player can rest when ever he wants with out sleep upto 3 times\n\n8. Bedrolls can only be used 5 times before being destroyed. Tents can be used 10 times before being destroyed. This is done to act as a minor golds sink and can be \ncommented out if not desired.\n\n9. Bedroll and tent is a small token in player inventories so not to take up space.\nFood rations are stackable to help reduce space.\n\nv1.1 fix \nFixed problem with the ration stack being taken instead of single ration.\nMade Bedroll and Tent consumable.\nv1.2 fix\nFixed a problem with the animation being stuck to either the bedroll or Tent resting when a player was just using the standard rest.\nMade the Standard rest option independant of the rest timer.\nv1.3 fix\nFixed problem with the Rest timer only going off the first person logged on instead of the person doing the rest.\nRemoved mod HB script, was not needed any more.\nRemoved nw_restoption script, was not needed any more.\n\n// This is the last update for the Rest System.

Basicly you can take a spell such as Fireball/Flame Strike cast it on a ordinary weapon and it will make it magical (+1), add 1d6 fire damage (for Flaming property) and then name the item accordingly.

It didn't occur to me until recently that others might use NWN's base items, so hopefully I got the naming scheme to pass over any NWN items.

Basically there are 5 levels of administration with level 5 being the highest and level 0 the lowest. Each level has it's own set of commands, which increase that player's ability to moderate the server respectively. Advancement in admin level allows the player to use the new commands along with all the commands of the previous levels. So a player of admin level 3 can use the commands available at level 1. Admin levels can be set by both DMs and players with level 5 admin. The advantage to this system is that you can give trusted players power to help keep your server running smoothly, without having to worry about them having too much. The level required for each command can easily be changed in fky_skip_admin. Should you need any help doing this please post and I'll go into more detail. So without further delay, here is a list of commands with their respective levels and descriptions:\n\n[level 1]\n!finger ~gets admin level of target\n\n[level 2]\n!jumpto ~jump to target\n!servermessage [message] ~send server message\n\n[level 3]\n!boot ~boot target\n!invis ~activate cutscene invis on yourself\n!uninvis ~deactivate cutscene invis on yourself\n!penguin ~penguin target\n!unpenguin ~unpenguin target\n!paralyze ~paralyze target\n!unparalyze ~unparalyze target\n!jumptome ~jump target to you\n!partyjumptome ~jump your party to you\n!summon [resref] ~permanently summon any creature\n\n[level 4]\n!heal ~cast heal on target\n!harm ~cast harm on target\n!rez ~cast rez on target\n!kill ~kill target\n!spawncreature [resref] ~spawn any creature\n!spawnitem [resref] ~spawn any item\n!setappearance [#] ~set your appearance \n\n[level 5]\n!setlevel [#] ~set target's admin level\n!doublespeed ~increase speed(updates to nwn broke original function so not quite what it used to be)\n!halfspeed ~decrease speed\n\nAlso, I added an extra item to !playerinfo to show their admin level.\n\nFor the commands that require additional user input such as !servermessage, just type the input to the side, no quotes or brackets. (ex: !servermessage Server will go down for updates in 15 minutes.)\n\n[HOW TO INSTALL]\nTo use this system, you must install both NWNx and SIMTools v3.0. Once those are installed, import the erf and overwrite fky_chat_inc. These admin levels work off integers stored on a database object on the PC. You will need to create an object with the tag 'database' for this to work, and I've included a script you can add to your OnClientEnter script to give the PC the database. \n\n[Thanks]\nSpecial thanks to LoonyTick who helped me get of the ground with this project back when I just had an idea and a keyboard. \nAlso thanks to Zunath, who taught me everything I know about nwscript and has provided me with direction ever time I hit a road block and want to give up entirely. \nAnd finally HUGE Thanks to FunkySwerve for providing the community with SimTools and for giving me tremendous help in the builders' forums every time I came up with some crazy idea I wanted to try out in nwn. \n\n\nI'd love to hear any questions or suggestions anyone might have, so please post if you have any.

Soul \nCrystals can either be found or purchased, at your discretion. The \nrespawn penalty of gold &/or XP loss has been removed.\n\n-Players without Soul Crystals will experience a respawn delay, (of 2 \nmin.), with a \"floating text timer count-down\". This respawn delay is in \nplace so that any nearby (allied) players have ample time, (should they \nbe involved in a fight, or otherwise), to resurrect the fallen player.\n\n-You (the developer) can customize where your players will respawn, \nregardless of the area they are in. Multiple areas can result in one \nrespawn location, or each area can have it's own.\n\n-A \"fail-safe\" is built in to this system, just in case you make an error \nin the \"respawn_init\" script, (or the script where all of your area & respawn \nwaypoint tags go).

I fixed a couple of bugs, updated the scripts for version 1.69, and made some minor changes that I consider improvements, although opinions may differ on that. While I was at it, I expanded the customization options for builders. See the change log for a more detailed list of changes.\n\nA secondary purpose of this submission is to make some auxiliary files available to players and builders. First up are the two guides I wrote (one for players and one for builders). These are written for this version of the rope scripts, but are somewhat applicable to the CEP version of these scripts -- enough to give people the basic idea, even though some of the details (especially about customizations) will be off if used as a reference for the CEP version.\n\nThe other file I wanted to make more readily available is an override that provides the C.R.A.P. animations. This did not go into CEP for some reason, even though the scripts that reference the animations did go into CEP. For the most part, not having these animations does not hurt, other than PCs shifting into a horse-riding pose at one point (for both CEP's and my versions of these scripts). On the other hand, dropping the C.R.A.P. version of a_ba_non_combat.mdl in a player's override will let that player see the intended animations (which do add to the experience). My source for this file is C.R.A.P. for 1.68 and CEP 2.\n\n\nWhat do I need?\n\nPlayers will want to download Rope_Animations.zip and decompress it into their override directory. They might also want to read the player guide.\n\nThe animation override might conflict with other overrides. It might be ineffective in modules with custom hak paks. If you're convinced it's causing problems, remove it. It does work for me, though.\n\nBuilders will want to download either RopeScripts_TK_erf.zip or RopeScripts_TK_hak.zip (or both). The former gets decompressed into your erf directory, and the latter into hak. They might also want to read the builder guide and the change log. The \"erf\" version can be imported into any module (even one that does not use CEP, but you'd be missing the item and placeable blueprints in that case), but it will be completely ineffective if the module is associated with the cep2_crp_s hak pak. Unfortunately, associating with this hak is the simplest way to get the required item and placeable blueprints. If your module uses that hak pak, you need the \"hak\" version. My thinking is that a server admin would use the nwhak.exe utility to merge this hak into either cep2_crp_s.hak or cep2_custom.hak. (It is technically possible to use my hak directly, but that adds the requirement that your players get this hak.) Someone who is building a single-player module and needs the hak version might want to merge my hak into a module-specific hak that gets downloaded with the module.\n(Yes, scripts in haks can be such a pain to update, but what are you going to do? CEP made their decision about this, and attempts to convince them that it is not the best idea have been met with baseless attacks from the CEP clique.)\n\n\nRequirements:\n\nThese scripts require version 1.69 because they have horse support. They do not themselves require HotU, but the .erf is flagged as needing that because that was easier for me (and can be changed upon request). CEP 2.2+ is useful in that it provides item and placeable blueprints, but it is technically not required for these scripts to function.\n\n\n11/19 -- bug fix: Closed a loophole that could allow an encumbered PC to climb if an equipped weapon has a strength bonus.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3671":{"Title":"Harper Scout Espionage Tool","Author":"Greven134","Submitted":20091110,"Updated":20100816,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"HOTU-1.69","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Other","Description":"Harper Scout Espionage Tool: Magical Bug V3\n\nWith this set of scripts, Harper Scouts at level 5 are able to place magical bug on objects.

It keeps anyone from leaving or trying to escape. My script will allow you to create a Rover to defend the village of your choice. Here is how the system works: it comes with one Rover creature and one script. All you need do is just import the Rover .erf file, and set up an area near the outskirts of any town, city, or vilage wherever you want to keep PCs from leaving the area. The Rover creature is under Module Specific; place Rover wherever you want Rover to show up and on that exact spot make a waypoint and name it Rover_Retreat. This will allow Rover to return to that spot after dealing with any pesky PCs. Lastly, make a waypoint at the road or entrance back to the town, city, or village from this outskirts area. Label the waypoint VillageBorder and save the module. Let it build if you wish. Whenever Rover encounters a PC passing through the outskirts, it will attempt to send the PC back to that waypoint. It only needs to touch you for this to happen, so watch out for Rover when you see it! Contact with Rover will also knock you asleep for 10 seconds, even if you are normally immune to mind-affecting spells or to sleep (as it is with elves). See the demo mod, \nincluded with the .erf, for exactly how this system should be set up. Rover is only a level 1 creature, but is designed to be able to take down any PC of any level... so you cannot really underestimate it based on its' level. Also, Rover is set as plot so it cannot be killed, either. All in all, it is the perfect warden for any place that you may want to keep a PC \"Prisoner\" in. - As they say in the Village... Be seeing you!\n\nNote: Make certain that Rover's retreat point is far away from the VillageBorder waypoint.\n\nContains a rover.erf file and a Rover demo mod so you can try the system and see how it works.

The first one should be placed in the module, and the second one is created when the mold is \"spotted\" by a player. To make this work, a trigger must be placed covering a large area in which the player can spot the mold (this trigger can be omitted to make an unspottable mold). A second trigger is placed directly over the mold to cause the spores to trigger when the mold is disturbed.\n\nNotes:\nIn my module I use a custom skill, Wilderness Lore, to check if a player can spot the mold, though by default this is turned off. If you have your own similar custom skill, you can set the variable \"MODULE_SWITCH_WILDERNESS_LORE\" on your module to the skill you want to use. You can use any skill for this, whether a custom one or Spot, Search (or Survival, if you were to reuse these scripts in NWN2).\n\nI also use a custom poison, but this requires a HakPak, so for ease of use I used Phase Spider Venom instead, which is very similar but slightly stronger.\n\n\nAs always, feel free to use/modify or generally do with this what you will, though of course credit is most appreciated if you do use it.\n\n\nP.S.

The first item is Kenshiro's outfit from the popular Anime and Manga series Hokuto no Ken \"Fist of the North Star\". The second is a glove that lets any monk character be able to practice Hokuto Shinken, a technique that makes their enemies explode and grants them other abilities as well, such as to kill, blind, and wound your opponents.\n\nInstructions: Simply put the script ondeath_hokuto on any enemy, and it will check to see if you are wearing the glove. If you are, then your monk will deliver a most awesome killing blow with a 50% chance of saying to the hapless opponent \"You're already dead\" just like Kenshiro. Naturally, this script goes in a creature's ondeath slot. Only a monk class can use the glove, so plan accordingly.\n\nIncluded is a demo module and an .erf file for importing this prefab set into your own module.

It is said that the average person only uses 30% of their body's strength, whereas those trained in Hokuto Shinken are taught to tap into the remaining 70% in order to perform their destructive techniques. It can kill, blind, and wound. Those who are found unworthy to practice Hokuto Shinken are often either killed or crippled, so that the secrets of this deadly art do not fall into the wrong hands.

This was because the PC's had naturally come along and destroyed them in search of treasure. Someone (Darryl Sandell) said that they had solved this problem on their PW. Whenever someone damaged a door they were polymorphed into a penguin. The routine that they used for this was also released in this thread (routine - sc_polydoor). This inspired me to come up with a whole host of other things that could be visited upon offending PC's. Unfortunately I had not learned enough scripting at this time to implement them. I did however add to the thread with this list.\n\nA few months after this decided to build a module based on this list which I called \"Basher's End\". In the course of doing this I taught myself how to code in nwn script and found that there were some things that you just couldn't do (do you know how to drop a dead shark on some PC's head?). Anyway to cut a long story short, the size of \"Bashers End\" grew to more than I could manage at the time and so I abandoned it. Rather than allowing all the thought and work that into I have decided to release the code, blueprints etc. for some of the doors that I created, which is what you have here.\n\nIn order for you to try these doors for yourself I have included a demo module.

I had expected the Vault to be chock-full of these, but most Vampire systems are for PCs, so I figured I'd upload my own.\n\nWhen killed, a Vampire will change into gaseous form and retreat to the nearest coffin, where it will gradually regenerate. After a given delay (defaults to 60 seconds), it will reappear at the coffin's location (obviously you can use standard NWN posts to make it return to its old location). If no coffin exists, the Vampire will simply disappear (so you can both simulate a Vampire retreating to a coffin in a different area, or allow players to destroy the coffin and thus defeat the vampire). If the coffin is destroyed with the Vampire inside, the Vampire will return to gaseous form and attempt to find another coffin.\n\nIf the player finds the coffin, with a Vampire inside, they can stake the Vampire (they need an item tagged \"VampireStake\" - a stake of holly, which is considered by some stories to be the only kind of stake which will work, is included, but you can of course make your own) or nail the coffin shut (either with iron nails, tagged \"IronNail\" - which are included - or, improvising, with Iron Spikes, the crafting material). Note that if staked, the coffin is left empty and so can be used by another Vampire. If nailed shut, the coffin is unusable, but if it is destroyed, the Vampire will escape.\n\nIf the Vampire is caught outside in the daytime, it will begin to burn, taking a -4 penalty to attacks, skills and saving throws for one round before dying completely. Vampires destroyed by sunlight will not return to gaseous form and will not regenerate - they will be destroyed completely. However, a Vampire who starts to burn will make for shade or the entrance to a building right away in an attempt to save him/herself from imminent death.\n\nYou can paint down triggers tagged Vampire_ShadowTrigger with at least one waypoint tagged WP_Vampire_ShadowTrigger inside them to denote areas of shade where a Vampire can stand, during the day, while being unaffected (if outside these areas, Vampires will run to the waypoints if they catch fire).\n\nThe system is quite flexible and can easily be changed by a number of variables.\nOn the module:\nMODULE_SWITCH_VAMPIRE_DISALLOW_SHADE - If TRUE, Vampires will not use shadow triggers. Of course, you could simply not paint any.\nMODULE_SWITCH_VAMPIRE_DISALLOW_DOOR_ESCAPE - If TRUE, Vampires will not run through doorways to escape the sunlight.\nMODULE_SWITCH_VAMPIRE_DISALLOW_NAILING - If TRUE, players cannot nail coffins shut.\nMODULE_SWITCH_VAMPIRE_DISALLOW_STAKING - If TRUE, players cannot kill Vampires with stakes. Of course, you could simply not put any stakes in.\n\nOn the vampire:\nCoffinTag - The tag of the coffin the Vampire will use. You need to set this on any custom Vampires. This allows you to have a Vampire use a unique coffin.\nCoffinRewardXP - The XP a player gets from nailing this Vampire inside a coffin or staking him/her.\nVampireLord - If TRUE, the Vampire is a Vampire Lord and suffers penalties from sunlight, but is not killed. Full support for the Vampire Lord's other features has not been added yet, however.\n\nOn doors:\nNoVampiresAllowed - If TRUE, Vampires cannot escape through this door when caught in the sun. This is because in most classical Vampire accounts, they cannot enter private property without permission. Thus, you can set this on homes in areas Vampires are likely to be, but not, say, ruins, caves or public places.\n\nNote:\nThe Vampire created from the coffin (after regenerating) is a new copy of the original with the same ResRef. Thus, any placed Vampires which differ from their templates will come back without those modifications. If you want a Vampire to drop items, I suggest you only set those items to droppable on a placed version, not on the template, because otherwise each time the Vampire regenerates and is killed, it will drop a new set of items.","Rating":9.92,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"3722":{"Title":"BlackJack para un Casino.

The timer resets and the whole thing repeats. If a patroller encounters a corpse (dead posted guard) he will shout an alarm and both guards will run for the exit to raise the alarm. The dead posted guard is created when you kill a guard on sentry duty, he will drop his sword, shield & helmet and leave a corpse that can be picked up and moved. Hide the body and the patrol won't raise an alarm, leave it to be found and they will. If the patrol does spot the body you still get the chance to kill them before they raise the alarm. When you kill both guards the timer resets and normal patrols resume. If you kill 2 (Configureable) patrols the alarm is automatically raised after a set time. (It would be wouldn't it?) When the alarm is raised 4 (Configureable) guards enter and run around the area until they are killed. When they are, the timer resets and when it fires more the initial quantity of guards and 2 extra guards appear and hunt for you. This will continue until you either escape or are overwhelmed. All killed guards will leave a corpse so the only way to stop it is to hide all the bodies. These are heavy and will probably over-burden you so it's best to hide the sentry and not alert the patrols at all. Patrols will attack you if you are out of the cells but ingnore you when they think you're safely locked up. All the system settings can be adjusted in the module load script. See the notes in it for guidance.\n\nAdded Non CEP version. Just cut and paste the placeables entry into your 2da hak and put the MDL into a hak.\n\nAdded disguise option:\n You can now take the sentry's equipment, equip it and stand in the sentry's place and fool the patrol. Works with associates and party members for PW use. Just get one of your party to dress as the sentry and the patrols won't miss him.

The template includes all the necessary interface instructions (like finding the item in question and setting the executed script return value), allowing the scripter to focus on what needs to be done.

Between the comments and the function names, I hope the details of using this are self-explanatory. For more of an overview, read on.\n\nThe design of this template breaks each event out into its own function, with relevant information (such as the item in question) passed as parameters.

I suppose that makes this something of a tutorial, presenting a reasonable way to implement tag-based items.\n\nThe primary intended audience for this are those who are have taken a step beyond the script generator, or at least are willing to take that step. (A \"step\" would include just being able to adapt a generated script to work as one of these functions -- some understanding of scripting principles is required, but not necessarily the ability to write a script from scratch.)\n\nSome more experienced scripters may find this a useful reference for tagbased design, such as what object is running each event and when exactly the OnSpellCastAt event fires within the spell hook.

Clandestine evil PCs were often outed before they could establish themselves, and paladins had a hard time of it too.\n\nAs a result, this version of the script no longer detects PCs under L6 unless they are clerics of evil deities. This allows low level evil PCs a little time to establish themselves, and well played evil to assuage a paladin's suspicions, while allowing a paladin to RP with low level PCs so long as they are not obviously evil. Clerics of evil deities are receiving divine power from an evil god, so they'll always be strong enough to detect. NPCs are detected at all levels and don't get the low level exemption.\n\nDetermination of which deities are evil is from the 2da below, which goes in the Override folder on the server.\n\nIn addition to this change, other changes are as follows:\n\n- Fixed incorrect calculation of evil power for PCs who were not pure clerics\n\n- Detects non-evil clerics of evil deities as evil regardless of their actual alignment. Note that NPC clerics are detected the same way, but must have the correct entry in their deity field.\n\n- Blackguard levels are treated as evil cleric levels\n\n- Only actual paladin levels count for being stunned by overwhelming evil \n\n- Items, Doors, and Placeable objects can have an EVILPOWER integer variable set on them, and will detect as evil if within range when evil is detected.\n\n1 - faint evil\n2-4 - moderate evil\n5-10 - strong evil\n11+ overpowering evil\n\nThis allows a specific area of a map to be set as evil, by dropping some invisible objects in it, naming them \"area\" and setting the EVILPOWER variable. Items on the ground will be detected, but not if in the possession of a creature or in a container.\n\n- Set a local variable on detected PC or NPC, so most of the script only runs against a particular PC once per reset, after that it just checks the variable and reports accordingly.\n\n- Added a definition for a new type of evil masking item that only needs to be in a PC's inventory (not equipped) to mask them. In Narfell, these items are extremely rare, and always have a plot attached, since they are made from the removed heart of a paladin.\n\nThe erf contains the code above, the Paladin Detect Evil Tool item (which shows up in Miscellaneous -> Kit in the toolset) plus three other include files. These may be required - I'm not completely certain how far this was modified from standard HCR before I got to it.\n\nThe forum thread referenced below was our player notification when the new script went in.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3744":{"Title":"Glowing Eyes tokens","Author":"Sethan","Submitted":20100518,"Updated":20100519,"Category":"Creature Related","Expansions":"NWN-1.69","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Combat","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"This script allows the use of custom tokens to drop on a PC or NPC to give them the 8 glowing eye effects.\n\n8 custom tokens are defined, one per eye color.

This is a simplified version of my Tag-based Template, with the events other than activation removed and the remaining code merged into the main() function. This should make the template less intimidating for beginning scripters who are only interested in handling the OnActivate event anyway.\n\nThe basic way to use this is to copy it to your script (named for the item's tag), then add your code where indicated (near the bottom of the script, but before the closing curly brace). Variables representing the item activated, the character activating the item, the object targeted, and the location targeted are defined at that point so you do not have to worry about how to find them.\n\nThe primary intended audience for this are those who are have taken a step beyond the script generator, or at least are willing to take that step. (A \"step\" would include just being able to copy the insides of a generated script into another script and deal with resolving variable names as needed.) An understanding of what variables are and how they are used would be useful, but the ability to write a script from scratch is not strictly necessary.\n\nIt occurred to me that my full-blown template might be intimidating to some and that the vast majority of tag-based items probably only handle activation, so I thought I would post this in case someone might find it helpful.\n\nNov 13, 2010 -- renamed the \"oTarget\" and \"lTarget\" variables for better compatibility with scripts originating with the Script Generator","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3752":{"Title":"Markshire's Nerfed Pulse Drown","Author":"Markshire","Submitted":20100624,"Updated":20110429,"Category":"Creature Related","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Combat","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Forums":"Link","Description":"Now on Facebook!\n\nThe ORIGINAL water elemental ability, PULSE DROWN works like this: \nElemental takes 50% of its hit points in damage.A radius of size large (5 meters) determines who is affected.

It will grant any builder full controll over whats done before and after it fires custom spellhook script. \n\n1) You can change, remove or add stuff in \"x2_inc_spellhook\" without recompiling all spellscripts. Like spellhooking spells cast by non-players.\n2) You can hook creature abilities and feats or un-hook some spell more easier than with default spellhook method.\n3) Its more efficient (Just guess, I have not clocked it.) since engine now will cache the spellhook stuff in \"x2_inc_spellhook\" library (fact). \n\nInstalation:\n1) Put content of override folder into your server's override. \n2) Then import spellhook.erf and allow rewrite default \"x2_inc_spellhook\" script.\n3) Build your module (need to only compile all scripts with new library you imported)\n4) Now do whatever you feel to do with spellhook. The new spellhook script is called \"ev_mod_spellhook\" including \"x2_inc_spellhook\".\n5) OPTIONAL: in override folder there is 2da called hook_all_spells.2da, if you want to hook all spells, creature abilities and feats as well, rename this 2da to spells.2da and its done.\n\nHow to choose to hook spell?\nOpen spells.2da, if you want to hook some spell/ability/feat, just change value in ImpactScript to \"ev_mod_spellhook\" without quotes ofc. Thats it.\nIf you want to remove spellhooking of spell, then replace \"ev_mod_spellhook\" with original script filename you can find in spells2 on the same row.\nThats it.\n\nDeep info:\nPackage contains all spell scripts recompiled with modified x2_inc_spellhook library where X2PreSpellCastCode() function just returns TRUE. The script \"ev_mod_spellhook\" now runs instead any spell and then make the spellhook stuff and then (if spellhook allowed it) make 2DA lookup for real spell script and execute it. See Code.\nThe modified \"x2_inc_spellhook\" library is distrubuted in ERF file in order you could build module with it, ensure that no spell you changed will run spellhook twice.","Rating":5.75,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"3760":{"Title":"ELC_Keks","Author":"Keks","Submitted":20100730,"Updated":20100923,"Category":"Rulesets","Expansions":"HOTU-1.69","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Combat","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"This system uses only base NWN resources without any internal or external databases. \nCustom Enforce Legal Characters (ELC).","Rating":9,"Awards":[]},"3761":{"Title":"Script to make more difficult to escape from monsters","Author":"Uther1978","Submitted":20100801,"Updated":20100825,"Category":"Creature AI","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Combat","Description":"I have noticed that when the PC escapes from enemies following a straight line, the enemies with melee weapon can't hit him, even if they are more fast.

Short short summary:\n\nGeneric open shop script based on the player's alignment, level and class.\n- Players must have at least one level in the class.\n- Players must be within the correct alignment for the class based shop they are trying to use. Meaning a non-lawful monk will not be able to shop at the monk store.\n- Uses appraise skill.\n\nMore detailed summary:\n- Class limit: The system is set up so that each shop keeper will ONLY sell to a player that has at least one level in a specific class. The shop keeper will ONLY sell to that class. The system is not set up to handle a single shop keeper selling to multiple classes. Note: This system is only set up to deal with the standard classes. There is no support for the prestige classes added in SoU and HotU.\n\n- Alignment limit: If the class has any alignment restrictions, any character not within those limits will not be able to shop there. For example, a non-lawful monk would not be able to shop at the monk store since monks must be of lawful alignment. This happens automatically based on the class; nothing needs to be set on the shop keeper. \n\n- Level limit: When a character of the correct class and alignment attempts to shop, the script will automatically open one of three level specific shops. This allows you to sell different items to different levels of characters. What you stock in those shops is up to you. All levels are used then computing the player's range, not just the levels of the specific class. The level ranges can be adjusted for ALL shops using this script. It is not configurable on a per shop keeper basis. The default ranges are listed below and can be changed in the function MythosGetShopTag. Make sure to recompile the script if you change the ranges!\nLevels 1 to 12\nLevels 13 to 24\nLevels 25+\n\nSystem Limits:\nThis script was designed for a very specific purpose on our server. So there are some limits worth mentioning.\n1. The NPC shop keeper can only host shops for ONE class. Meaning you can't have an NPC that sells to both fighters and barbarians.\n2. The script can only open three shops. This is easily fixed if you know how to script, simply add support for more MYTHOS_SHOP_TAG_#s.\n\nBuilder Suggestion:\nWith each NPC shop keeper hosting 3 different shops, we suggest that the NPC and shops be on a separate small map to cut down on lag as the map and shops load.\n\nDetailed instructions for use included and the scripts are well documented.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nFor a similar script that opens a single shop based on the flag set on the NPC shopkeeper, with the option to require an inventory item (such as a key or guild token), check out our �Generic Shop Script�.\nLink\n\nLink\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3771":{"Title":"Custom Script Templates","Author":"Genisys / Guile","Submitted":20100907,"Updated":20100907,"Category":"Tutorials","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Combat","Description":"This is a set of script templates I use, while some may be useful to you, if you like any of them, simply put them in the folder \"scripttemplates\" found in your \"nwn\" folder..

It fixes many of the bugs and exploits that plagued that system and adds several new functions. This is the basics of it: A simple, but effective, death script that creates a player corpse on the spot where the PC is killed, and turns the PC into a ghost upon respawning. The corpse is locked to prevent other PCs from being able to loot it while you seek the means to resurrect. While a ghost, the PC is friendly with all hostiles, but cannot unlock the corpse. Going to a healing fountain will fully restore the PC back to life and unlock the corpse. Hostiles will then become hostile once again. Now you can go back to where you died and recover your goods. Of course, other PCs can find and loot your corpse once it is unlocked as well, so be sure you get there before they do! ;) I used a Healing Fountain as the means to resurrect, but you *could* likewise use a healer who fires the same script, to make it more like in UO. Tested in single-player and multiplayer Nwn!\n\nThe OnClientEnter portion of the system ensures that anyone entering the module is no longer a ghost; this will prevent players from saving the game as a ghost, loading, and coming back with all of a ghost's effects still attatched to him/her. It will also make certain the player starts fully healed, cured, and with no status ailments; in effect, each play session is a clean start, whether you are starting over or loading from a saved game. This prevents any permanent deaths.\n\nA demo module is included, along with an .erf file containing the three scripts and the healing fountain placeable, so that you can import the entire system into your own modules. To install:\n\n1. Import the .erf into your module. The Healing Fountain and Player Corpse can be found under: Special / Custom1. Do not touch the Player Corpse; the scripts themselves deal with it.\n\n2. In the Toolset, click on Edit and go into your module's Module Properties. Click Events.\n\n3. Under OnPlayerDeath, use uo_undeath instead of the default script.\n\n4. Under OnPlayerRespawn, use uo_onrespawn instead of the default script.\n\n5. Under OnClientEnter, use wrap_onclientent instead of the default script. Click OK.\n\n6. Place the Healing Fountain anywhere that you want to use as a resurrection site. You can have as many of these as your module calls for, so place as many as will be needed. (Note: In the Demo, look for the Healing Fountain behind where the player starts, all the way at the edge of the map.)\n\n7.

The button itself can also be hidden using the standard CRAP hidden object technique.\n***This system does not require C.R.A.P. to function.***\n\nThe system was built on the CEP2.3+ CRAP and while it does not require any of the hak's for the scripting to basically work, the true functionality comes from the active CRAP scripts.\n\nIncluded in this package is a version of the CEP2.3+ CRAP demo module with this system loaded.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSystem includes:\n1 placeable - \"button\" resref \"button\"- located in the \"secret object\" directory\n1 waypoint template - \"Generic CRAP Button Waypoint\" resref \"gen_crap_wp\" in the waypoint directory\n1 conversation - \"gencrapconv\"\n4 scripts\ngencrap_conv - the OnUsed script for the placeable.\ngencrap_chk - checks state of the button during the conversation\ngencrap_press - script that runs when button is pressed.\ngencrap_depress - script that runs when the button is pressed again - destroys the object previously created.\nAdditional Script\ngenrunonce - Generic Run Once script. This is a general script that is not part of this system, but provides additional functionality.\n\n***This system does not require C.R.A.P. to function.***\n\nSample module\nCEP23CRAP with button demo.mod\nThis requires 169, CEP2.3+, the ctp generic doors hak, the custom \"crap_anim\" and the \"crap_scripts\" hak. The only major change to the regular scripts is an edited zep_module_on_load script which has a fix I needed for some of the CRAP files to work. The \"crap_scripts\" hak contains the system scripts that have been added back into the module and recompiled after adjusting the \"crp_inc_control\" master control file. Many of the important CRAP systems are turned on,including coins, gems, shattered items and the death system.\nThe demo is a modified version of the CRAP demo module that comes with the CEP. In the starting location, the PC will be directed by a description to explore a certain area. This will lead them to some of examples of this system working. The \"crap_anim\" hak has the working animations for the system.\n-----------------------\n12/5/2010\nAdded a little to the script to accomodate modifying Pit Edge targeting difficulty per the Improved CRAP rope climbing scripts by The Krit\nLink .\n\n10/2011\nv.1.2 upgrades and changes some fundemental ways these scripts work. Please read the documentation included with the erffile.\n\n4/2012\nv.1.3 Fixes a number of bugs, including working across areas, ladder creation and button setup.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3783":{"Title":"Dispel Self-cast Spells on Self.","Author":"ArgentumRegio","Submitted":20101126,"Updated":20101127,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"NWN-1.69","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Spell effects","Description":"Many casters have asked in the past \"Can I dispel my own invisibility spell in NWN?\" The answer had been 'no' but that was then, this is now.\n\nThis short system added to your module CHAT script will allow your PCs to remove any spell effect they placed on themselves at will, or even all of them at once.\n\n66.232.100.90 cep2.1 where we code magic\n\naldorhal.forumotion.com\n\nVisit or leave feedback!

It has already been stated by Chris Priestly that the old boards can disappear without notification.\"\n\nI thought it would be a good idea if I 'rescued' as much of the scripts on these old forums as I knew the location of. I have therefore gone through all 18 pages of the \"Endless List of HomeBrew Functions [post functions only, not for asking questions]\" thread, all pages in the even older \"Completed Scripts\" and 1 or 2 other locations that I had an address for and extracted the scripts from these pages. I have only included code that was actually posted on the old BioBoards and not anything that had a link to it away from the site. Even so this still equates to 360+ entries by 210 different authors. Each entry is credited to the original author and whatever relevant comment was made in thier board submission has been included as comments.\n\nI have also edited each submission in such a way that they now appear with the same programming style, which hopefully makes them more readable. Where there was more than one version of the same script, I have only included the latest version in the hope that it is more likely to be bug-free and fully working. In order to keep things managable, I have kept to the original pages for the 'Endless' scripts and the original topics for the rest. Finally, I have created seperate indexes for the 'Endless' scripts and the 'Complete' scripts. I haven't indexed the small number of other scripts as they are generally 1 to a page.\n\nA few things to note.\n\na. Some of these are (in computing terms) very old. In effect, they may have worked when written but updates to nwn may have rendered them either non-working or obsolete.\n\nb. Some of them are designed for single player, while others are for persistant worlds and yet others work with all types of game.\n\nc.

DESCRIPTION\nI've always wanted to see wizards using spell points in order to cast spell instead of the common \"spell slot\", but implementing a clean and user-friendly spell points system wasn't possible in nwn... until I discover MaxRock's nwnx_funcs (Link).\n\nSo here is my small spell points system using the nwnx_funcs plugin for nwnx.\n\nThe spells are still used as usual : all caster (except Bard and Sorcerer) still need to memorize spell in order to cast it, spells can still be countered...\nBut in order to cast a spell, the caster needs spell points.\nIn my implementation (and the demo module), the following caster classes use spells points (it can be configurate to limit the spell points system to less classes):\n- Bard\n- Cleric\n- Druid\n- Paladin\n- Ranger\n- Sorcerer\n- Wizard\n\nThe number of spell points a character can have depends of the caster class and the bonus point of the attribute linked to the caster class :\n- Bard : (8 + Charisma modifier) for each Bard level\n- Cleric : (10 + Wisdom modifier) for each Cleric level\n- Druid : (10 + Wisdom modifier) for each Druid level\n- Paladin : (6 + Wisdom modifier) for each Paladin level\n- Ranger : (6 + Wisdom modifier) for each Ranger level\n- Sorcerer : (12 + Charisma modifier) for each Sorcerer level\n- Wizard : (10 + Intelligence modifier) for each Wizard level\n\nThe cost of a spell depends of the spell level:\n- Spell level 0 : 1 spell point\n- Spell level 1 : 4 spell points\n- Spell level 2 : 8 spell points\n- Spell level 3 : 12 spell points\n- Spell level 4 : 16 spell points\n- Spell level 5 : 20 spell points\n- Spell level 6 : 24 spell points\n- Spell level 7 : 28 spell points\n- Spell level 8 : 32 spell points\n- Spell level 9 : 36 spell points\n\nAfter casting a spell, the caster memorizes back the spell (except for Bard and Sorcerer who get back 1 spell slot for the appropriate level), so he can cast the spell again (if he has enough spell points...).\nIt's only possible thanks to the nwnx_funcs.\n\n\n2. CONTENT\nThe zbl_spell.erf contains the spell point system script files and the nwnx_funcs script files. However it may be a good idea to get the last nwnx_funcs version as MaxRock is still working on it (and you may found useful functions).\nThe demo_module.zip contains a demo module where the spell point system is active. Don't forget to use nwnx and the nwnx_funcs plugin in order to run it!\nThe README.txt file contains all the steps in order to install the spell point system in your module.\n\nYou can modify the \"zbl_spell_inc\" script if you want to limit the spell points system to less caster classes, to modify the spell points gained per level or to change the spell cost.\n\nAs it's just a plain system, it may be not balanced ; feel free to give me any comment to adjust it.\n\n\n3.

A mage casts a spell, and the combat log shows the target's saving throws and relevant damage reduction/resistance/immunity. A warrior attacks and hits an opponent, and the combat log shows the target's saving throws and relevant damage reduction/resistance/immunity. (Saving throws? Yes. Think \"on-hit: stun\".) A trap goes off, and the log of the trap setter shows... nothing (unless the trap was fatal).\n\nThese scripts strive to change this situation. The functionality of traps is essentially unchanged, but some technical details have been modified so that the trap setter gets more feedback. Not complete feedback, as there are difficulties with the saving throw, but the trap setter does get to see the damage along with relevant reduction/resistance/immunity. And there is some saving throw feedback -- not the roll itself, but a success/failure message along with an estimate of the saving throw and the DC. (The estimate lacks any save modifiers of the \"vs. X\" variety; I acknowledge that in the message by using \"+ 6ish\" instead of \"+6\".) I think this conveys the most important information to be gained from the feedback without requiring a lot of work (both scripting and at execution time) that I could not be certain is accurate.\n\nThe observant might be wondering about my use of \"essentially unchanged\" above. The only change to trap functionality is a more consistent use of \"vs. X\" subtypes of saves within each trap type. Considering that probably few people know what these subtypes were and even fewer plan around them, I think it is fair to call this \"essentially unchanged\".\n\nOh wait, I said \"functionality\" -- is there something else? Well, I might have decided to spruce up the visual effects, particularly for the epic traps...\n\nWill this break anything? Probably not. Likely, this will only interact negatively with scripts whose purpose is to detect death/injury by trap. On the plus side, this can interact positively with scripts that should detect death/injury by trap. (The thing that got me to finally code this was playing Infinite Dungeons while taking a break from revising the Script Generator. ID keeps an internal score based on creatures killed, among other things. Well, this score keeping does not include kills by traps with the standard scripts, but does with this override.)\n\n\nHow to use:\n\nPlayers can decompress traps_w_feedback.7z into their override directory. This will affect your single-player games and any games you host.\n\nBuilders can decompress TrapFeedback_erf.7z into their erf directory, then import the decompressed file into a module. This is also how to see the source code for each of the trap scripts.\n\nFor the merely curious, the include file (which happens to do all the work) is in the code box.\n\n\nOverride contents:\nA bunch of nw_t1_*.ncs files and four x2_t1_*.ncs files.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3818":{"Title":"Expanded Trap Crafting","Author":"The Krit","Submitted":20110703,"Updated":20110703,"Category":"Conversation","Expansions":"HOTU-1.69","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Trade Skill and Item Creation","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"This expands the trap crafting dialog, allowing the crafting of acid blob and epic traps. There are two variants on this.\n\nVariants:\n\nThe first variant just adds the ability to craft all standard trap kits (\"Just give me the traps\"). It also supports a gold piece cost for epic traps, but by default this cost is 0. Acid blob traps are crafted with acid bombs. Epic traps require 35 components (since epic frost and epic sonic traps do five times the damage of their deadly counterparts, and deadly traps require 7 components). Crafting an epic trap is a DC 65 task (comparable to the set DC, as are the other craft DCs). These requirements can be changed in the #include script (x0_inc_skill).\n\nThe second variant goes a step further and adjusts the crafting procedure closer to my tastes (\"Give me the works\"). Like the first variant, the second adds the ability to craft acid blob traps from acid bombs, and epic traps from 35 components. It also changes when trap components are lost -- instead of 10% of all failures, it is equivalent to the chance of failing the skill check by 5 or more. (The skill roll is not actually used, but over numerous attempts, the number of times components are lost should be equal or close to the number of times the check failed by 5 or more.) This better approximates the D&D rule, and gives more value to investing in craft trap.\n\nIn addition, the second variant introduces a gold piece cost for all traps, defaulting to 1/6 the trap base price (but could be set to 0 if you want). The D&D rules say crafting costs 1/3 the base cost, and I figure the components can count for half of that. The end result is mostly symbolic for low-level traps (1gp for a minor spike; 4gp for minor frost, sonic, or acid splash), but becomes more significant for the tougher traps (640gp for a deadly fire trap), and could be considered downright expensive in the extreme case (4233gp for an epic electrical trap). This variant also supports an XP cost for each trap, but I left the cost at 0. (The XP cost must be payable without losing a level, and is never lost in a failed attempt.) Another supported feature is requiring a special component for each trap, but again this is not required in the default setup.\n\nFor the second variant, the crafting DC, gold cost, XP cost, and special component are defined in a new .2da file, tk_craft_trap.2da, which sits in your override directory (the host's override directory, in the case of multiplayer). Consequentially, these can be easily changed even when the package overall is used as an override. The number and types of regular components are defined in the #include script (x0_inc_skill) so are only accessible from the imported versions.\n\n\nPackaging:\n\nEach variant comes in three different packages. The one for most players is the override version. This gets decompressed into your override directory, where it will affect all single-player and hosted games, provided the module does not change the crafting conversation (which includes modifying weapon and armor appearances, in addition to trap crafting). CEP modules may very well change this conversation.\n\nFor module builders, there are two import versions -- one based on the standard crafting conversation, and one based on the CEP crafting conversation. Use whichever corresponds to what is currently used in your module. After decompressing the download, the .erf gets imported into your module, while the other files (if any) go into your override or module hak pak. (They function as server-side overrides.)\n\nIf you are already using a crafting conversation other than BioWare's or CEP's, you'll need to import one of my packages into a temporary module, rename the x0_skill_ctrap conversation, then import your module's version of that conversation, then replace the trap crafting branch in your conversation with the branch from the renamed conversation. Export the dialog, and import it back into your real module. A bunch of steps, but should be fairly straight-forward.\n\n\nOverride files:\n\nFor reference, the files that could be added to your override are the following.\n\ntk_craft_trap.2da -- information for the second variant\ntk_craft_trap.txt -- documentation for tk_craft_trap.2da\nx0_skctrap_act_*.ncs -- scripts for the conversation\nx0_skctrap_con_*.ncs -- scripts for the conversation\nx0_skill_ctrap.dlg -- the crafting conversation","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3819":{"Title":"AI: Jumping Creatures","Author":"The Magus","Submitted":20110710,"Updated":20110712,"Category":"Creature AI","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type - Combat","Forums":"Link","Description":"The purpose of this system is to enable certain creatures to leap obstructions in the tileset, such as chasms, or complicated wok meshes.

The default death behavior is based on HCR and Tom Banjo's death system. Custom death/dying behavior can be unique to a particular killer of the PC or to the area in which the PC dies. While working on a single player module, I found that in certain circumstances, I wanted to launch specially scripted cutscenes or otherwise highlight these dramatic moments - perhaps even spare the main character for story reasons. This system enabled me to do that. You can specify the custom death script to run, by setting a local string on a particular NPC or Area. Should that NPC kill or mortally wound the PC, then their custom death or dying script will run in place of the default behavior. See the scripts for more. \n\nThis ERF includes five scripts, and six placeables. For the placeables, see the templates titled \"Bleed 1\" etc... in the placeables palette under Custom : Battlefield.\n\nAdditional changes to these bleeding systems include:\nThe bleeding system's delay has been removed in single player games (unless a henchman is available to possibly save you). These scripts have a constant that enables you to establish whether this is a MULTIPLAYER game. And the scripts include a function which looks for the presence of henchmen.\n\nNote on custom placeables:\nThe bloodstain placeables \"Bleed 1\" \"Bleed 2\" etc... were created with art assets from Project Q. If you do not have Project Q, do not despair, the script system does not use these placeables right out of the box. If you do have Project Q or have added other custom bloodstain content to your module, you are encouraged use those resources. To take advantage of them, once you have the appearances of the bloodstains to your liking, search through the scripts for Project Q and follow the instructions there. Some code will need to be commented out, and one line in the death script subequently uncommented.\n\nCredit:\nthis system extends elements of the old hcr (as used in the old PW Vives) as well as tom banjo's death system.

Its going in new directions and will likely result in failure due to the lofty goals, but I am going for it!\n\nVersion Notes:\n1.1\n- This version changed the SpawnCreature function to return the creature object so that it operates in the same manner as CreateObject.\n- This version also corrected the bad files that were included in the previous version.\n\n1.0\n-A future version may have an array object so that a dynamic set of data for the creature can be stored and retrieved.\n\nInstructions:\n\n#include \"_inc_simplespawn\" in a script in which you create or destroy a creature. As long as the creatures spawned with this system use the default death script (which this system overrides), their death should be tracked.\n\nThe functions to use are SpawnCreature and DespawnCreature. They do as their names suggest. Whenever creating or destroying a creature, these functions should be used if you wish to track their data and spawn state. See the scripts for more information.\n\nAdvanced Scripters:\nTo integrate this system with another spawning system replace the CreateObject functions of that system with SpawnCreature from this one.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3822":{"Title":"D20 Modern Combat System Override","Author":"Quixsilver and Zunath","Submitted":20110724,"Updated":20110904,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Requires Both Expansions (SoU & HotU)","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Combat","Includes":"Custom","Description":"Video Demo: Link\n\nThis combat system override is intended to replace the traditional NWN combat for D20 modern.

Of course this is easy to understand from a builder's perspective as setting up scores or even hundreds of NPC's with individual conversations, even simple one liners, is a royal PITA. \n\nUrk's Random One Liners is a small, simple, easy to modify script set designed to allow large mods to be populated by NPCs that will speak random one liners when spoken to. \n\nUsing this script set scores, or even hundreds, of NPCs can be given a single conversation file scripted to allow each to offer a random one liners to players initiating conversations with them. Unlike similar scripts I've found on the web you can't just stand and speak to one person over and over to see all the speak strings. Once a speak string is set on an object it doesn't change. You can only get one (or optionally two) strings from each NPC and then you need to move on to another to see a different string. There is also an option that allows the conversations to reset after one game day.\n\nI have made extensive use of this script set in my Rel Mord campaign mod and it adds a lot of mood and flavor, especially when the party breaks up to buy supplies and the DM has to split his or her attentions. I have 6 separate conversations developed that provide a broad range of potential clues and conversations for wandering PCs. \n\nConversation 1 is for Commoners.\nConversation 2 is for Guards.\nConversation 3 is for Nobles.\nConversation 4 is for Refugees (specific to that module).\nConversation 5 is for visitors to the city.\nConversation 6 is for students at Rel Mord University.\n\nThis package contains a sample character with Urk's Random One Liner scripts attached. To use simply modify and rename the conversation scripts. Mind you you'll need to modify the scripts to get them to say anything INTERESTING. The default strings will leave the NPC saying stuff like \"ENTER ONE LINER #5a HERE\".\n\nIf you want the one liner to change each time the npc is spoken with simply delete the top conversation node (or remove the \"text appears when\" script in that node). Personally I've never found a good reason to do that, but if you want to it's easy enough to do.\n\nIf you want the one liner to reset every 48 minutes (1 day of game time) just uncomment lines 46 through 51 in script 1.\n\nBy default the spoken line is determined by a 1d10 roll. This can easily be modified to allow for any number of possible one liners including a bell curve probability. For large mods or PWs you should consider using 2d20, 3d20 or even 2d100 probabilities and you should definitely uncomment the conversation reset lines. This has the advantage of having low probability results for rare or exceptional rumors (clues leading to quest givers, evil temples, thieves guilds, etc) and high probabilities for mundane results that can be used to establish mood, setting elements like current events, local politics and public figures, or local history like recent conflicts or political changes.\n\nThis conversation can be added to any object. No outside script support is needed.\n\nDO NOT ENTER TEXT INTO THE CONVERSATION NODES. If they are not left completely blank the scripts won't function.\n\nThe first time a character speaks it will offer a unique one liner (called ONE LINER 1a, ONE LINER 2a, ONE LINER 3a etc). Each time after that it will speak a standard follow up line (called ONE LINER 1b, ONE LINER 2b, ONE LINER 3b etc.). The follow up line can be the same or different as the builder wishes. It's pretty easy to copy/paste the \"if then\" lines that set the string variables from script 1 to script 3. This is a handy shortcut even if you intend to change one liners after the first time the NPC SPeaks. \n\nThe standard scripts in this package are unmodified. You do not need to overwrite any scripts when importing the sample character or conversation file.\n\nSHORTCUT FOR SCRIPTERS:\nYou can always add a line to a creature's OnSpawn script that sets the variable \"ConvKey\" to a random number on OBJECT_SELF (the conversation owner) and reset the variable according to whatever interval you choose by modifying script 1 to change the ConvKey variable rather than simply resetting it to 0. I chose not to do this to maximize the versatility and ease of use of the script, but using this technique you can then delete the top conversation node and just use script #1.\n\nVotes and due credit are humbly requested, but not required. Having fun using these scripts is NOT optional.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3825":{"Title":"LWPT - the APS/NWNX Programmable Talker NPC by Lil","Author":"LiliaWaynn","Submitted":20110731,"Updated":20111012,"Category":"Database Related","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Other","Includes":"Custom","Description":"LWPT - the APS/NWNX Programmable Talker NPC by LiliaWaynn\n\nAn efficient APS/NWNX Programmable Talker NPC by LW (LWPT) for MySql * Optimized.

The bonus slots gained by ability increase from these feats are lost everytime player logs in game.

haha). the module will then read the spawn information at the next heartbeat and create that object at the coordinates you clicked.\n\nof course, feel free to contact me for help getting it set up if you need it.\n\nwow, that's a lot of text.\n\n\nupdate:\ni had to add a bit of code to the game module to handle cases where items were being placed inside terrain. by default, the system was putting them at 0 on the Z axis, so stuff was ending up in mountains and things. i got a tip from the bioware forums to first create an invisible creature, find his altitude, destroy him, and THEN create the item at that altitude. now items and placeables are created where they should be.\n\nupdate 2:\ni guess it's a fairly complicated system to try to set up yourself. i tried to explain it well, but who knows if i was making sense. check out my \"demo\" website, and don't hesitate to contact me here or email or whatever. i'd be happy to help you set this up for your own servers.\n\nupdate 3:\nanother update to fix some bugs. when i would save a custom set of spawns and then reload it later, if my list of spawns was too big, then it would cause the \"too many commands at once\" error and kill the script in the game. i fixed it by limiting the number to only 10 spawns per heartbeat. i think my game was handling 30, but i still went with 10 to be safe. i'm not sure if different hardware can handle more commands or not.\n\noh, and another problem i had is that my original type in my \"savedspawns\" table was a text, and i think that was too small. i made an enormous amount of spawns in one area, and i think it got cut off when i saved it. i changed that table field to a longtext. i'm sure that's big enough :D if you were using my original setup, you'll need to update your mysql table. i was actually able to mysqldump that table, drop it, recreate it, and then restore my backup and successfully saved all my data.","Rating":10,"Awards":[]},"3839":{"Title":"Nightshade's Explosive Barrels","Author":"Nightshade","Submitted":20111207,"Updated":20111207,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Format":"Code Only","Type":"Type -

Destroy as many items as you wish. Their base values (in gold pieces) are added up then divided by X to get the number of charges that can be produced. By default, X is 1000. If the electrifier can produce more charges than the target item can accept, the excess is lost (unless the item was already fully charged).\n\nThe import version is for module builders, while the override can be used in single-player or by multiplayer hosts. In addition to the script, I've included a replacement Golden Chalice (x0_it_mthnmisc14) that is limited to 3 charges and a replacement Ring of Nine Lives (x0_it_mring012) that is limited to 9 charges and that costs 6 times normal per charge.

To that end, I set out to create the system presented to you in this package.\n\nWhat exactly does it do?\n\nThis script is designed to be flexible, easy-to-use, and to use the least amount of resources possible. The .erf comes with everything you need (two scripts, one placeable) to begin making your stashes. It will allow you to:\n\n* Give the player an XP bonus for finding the stash\n* Use a search or spot check as the requirement for discovering it (NOTE: You can check for one or for both. However, setting both a search and spot dc will not require to the player to pass both to find the stash, only one)\n* Send the player a message to their chat window upon finding the stash\n* Choose a name for the stash (I.E. Hole, or Compartment)\n* Spawn xd6 gold or a specific amount of gold into the stash\n* Spawn specific items into the stash\n\nNEW in v1.3\n* Spawn items into the stash using the loot tables that shipped with the game!\n\nSo there you have it! What're you waiting for? Download it and give it a spin :)\n\n-NineCoronas\n\nversion 1.3:\n* Removed some redundant variables\n* Added a 'default mode', no longer have to set \"StashType\" as it will automatically spawn the stash that comes with this package\n* Implemented the ability to use the random loot tables that come with the game","Rating":9,"Awards":[]},"3864":{"Title":"Javelin (Throwable Spear)","Author":"Jonathan Lee","Submitted":20120704,"Updated":20120723,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"HOTU-1.59","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Combat","Forums":"Link","Description":"Throwable Javelin!\n\nRequires:\n- x2_inc_switches (from HotU)\n- Tag-based scripting enabled\n\nUse the \"On Use\" unique property radial menu option in game to throw the javelin (otherwise doubles as a standard spear).","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3865":{"Title":"LOCK CAMERA VIEW","Author":"Gumu","Submitted":20120723,"Updated":20130327,"Category":"Scripting routines","Expansions":"Works on all versions","Format":"Module Only","Type":"Type - Manipulation","Description":"Third Person View:\n An easy change to your camera point of view:\n Appearance.2da\n Line 6 Human /Set Height default 2 to 1 or 1.5 Dwarf/Halfling\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n//LOCK CAMERA VIEW v1.69(On Conversation)\n //Good for TopView or SideScroller MOD's\n//Stops camera scrolling/movement\n//Camera Distance/Angle or also Direction\n//Get your cam in your favorite position\n//and start a conversation\n//firing this script TO LOCK CAM !!!\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n void main()\n {object oPlayer = GetPCSpeaker();\n if (!GetIsPC(oPlayer)) return;\n//LockCameraDirection(oPlayer);\n LockCameraDistance(oPlayer);\n LockCameraPitch(oPlayer);\n int bLocked=TRUE;\n StoreCameraFacing();}\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n//This script has to be recalled\n//after area transitions to relock cam !!!\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nConsole: ##\n unlockcamera=0 \"old nwn camera style\"\n unlockcamera=1 \"Free wheeling\"","Rating":"N/A","Votes":0,"Awards":[]},"3866":{"Title":"Keyring Mapcase (demo)","Author":"Carcerian/ffbj","Submitted":20120819,"Updated":20121016,"Category":"Inventory Item","Expansions":"HOTU-1.69","Format":"Module and Code","Type":"Type - Item Storage","Includes":"BioWare Standard","Description":"I updated Carcerian's keyring with a key removal function and added a Mapcase item for storing maps based on his original script.\n\nIn essense a 20 to 1 reduction in the space maps take up (it could be higher if you want) and additional functionality, such as showing the area you are in, if you have a map, even if it's in your mapcase.\nI added a bigbag or bigbox for placeable movement at the last minute.\nThe ottoman and the mirror can be captured.\nAnd I suppose saving the best for last, is the void item.

My version puts this spell in the enchantment school as it is a magical enchantment compelling a targeted dagger or kukri to spring into the air and attack the caster's enemies in the same manner as a dancing sword. The animated knife can be dispelled, and takes up one of the caster's henchmen slots.\n(2) Trigger: Alt Footsteps Forum\nCreatures entering the trigger have their footstep sounds altered to conform to a material specified by the trigger. The default condition of the trigger is to make an area of the floor sound like carpet when walked across, but any material is possible. How exactly the footstep sounds of the creature are altered depend upon the creature's default footstep. A dragon, human, or bird for example will each respond appropriately.\n(3) Area: Play Song List Forum\nThis enables a builder to set up a songlist that will play for players in an area. The songs on the list play in sequence. The only songs set up in this release are the wyvern crown of cormyr tracks. In Arnheim I have done this for all custom music I added as well.\n(4) AOE Gargoyle v3 (2012 oct 13) Forum\nThis is a more efficient method of spawning gargoyles from placeables as it uses an AOE's OnEnter event rather than a placeable's heartbeat. The standard system uses the script NW_O2_GARGOYLE in a statue's heartbeat. This system applies an AOE by script to a placeable with an enter event which will spawn the gargoyle creature.\n\n__________\nChange Log\n\n2012 oct 11 - AOE Gargoyle v2\n- added a second ERF for builders who are currently using standard gargoyles in their module and wish to replace them with this system.

This summoning strips the player off the chain. A summoned horse will automatically be assigned to the player who summoned it, preventing someone else from assigning it to themselves.\nThe horse can be fed by its owner or any other non-hostile player, which replenishes its health just like in case of feeding a familiar or animal companion. Horse's owner also can choose to unsummon the horse via conversation. When the horse is unsummoned, a corresponding chain is given to its owner so that they can summon the horse again.\n\n\nKnown bug:\n-Pegasus has no wings when mounted - this is an issue with CEP models and not specifically this system.

I figured other people might find it useful so I thought I'd share it. You should be able to easily integrate the health percentage half into any module (regardless if you built it) - can easily install it in any module in a few minutes at most - while the massive health pools part takes slightly more work, mainly if you want healing to work properly with it.\n\nInstallation is literally this for the health percentages:\n\n1. Download file from vault\n2. Open module in toolset\n3. Import erf with the script\n4. Copy/paste one line of code into the OnSpawn script\n5. Copy/paste a six line block of code into the OnPerception script\n\nDone!\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIntroduction:\n\nUpdateHP is a system with two primary features - the ability to display the health percentage of creatures and to allow effective hit points far beyond what the toolset can provide by default (toolset limit is roughly 13,000 whereas this system can support a little over two billion if somehow needed) without actually appearing to do anything special. These two features are independent - you can use either or both of them as you desire. The system can also be used to defend against the default Devastating Critical - see \"Immortality\" under Miscellaneous Information (though using the entire script for just that purpose is somewhat overkill). The system is extremely easy to set up and configure in general, though if you use MassiveHP there are some special details you should know (regarding interaction with other scripts/effects, primarily healing and extreme burst damage).\n\nIn general, the system works by starting the script once the creature perceives an enemy or PC. It then checks the creature every second (the frequency can be adjusted as per your needs). If the creature's hit points have changed (taken damage or been healed) and the health percentage has changed, it updates the creature's health percentage. If MassiveHP is enabled and the creature's hit points have changed, it updates the creature's effective hit points. If hit points have not changed, it simply checks again in a second. The checking speeds up to every half second if the creature is using MassiveHP and is below 3000 raw hit points.\n\nIf there are no PCs in the with the creature, the script shuts down and starts back up once the creature perceives another enemy or PC. This prevents the script from using resources when it does not need to be running (it does not start until needed and stops when not needed).\n\nIf you use this system, I ask that you do not make major modifications to the script without asking me - I would prefer to be able to incorporate any significant improvements into the base system so everyone can take advantage of it (giving credit for the improvement, of course). This does not apply to the frequency at which the script runs, adjust that as you would like. There is also a function called \"Special\" which can be freely customized to suit your module if you need something special done every time the bulk of the script runs. And, of course, feel free to comment out either ShowHP or MassiveHP if you only care about one of the features. Thank you.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nVideo below is slightly out of date - the general concept is the same but the script is called in the OnPerception instead of OnSpawn and the script shuts down if no PCs are in the creature's area. See change log for v1 to v2.\n\nVideo demonstration: Link\n\nBioware forum thread: Link\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n- Thanks to FunkySwerve for information regarding speed of different functions and some general ideas on improving performance for creatures not in combat\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nChange Log:\n\nv3 to v4\n- Fixed bug in advanced option introduced in v3 that would call the script on any creature in the area, even those who weren't meant to have the script run on them (potentially henchmen, summons, etc). No impact if you weren't using the advanced option\n\nv2 to v3\n- Chunk of code provided in script header to place in OnEnter script for areas to avoid having an incorrect health percentage for a few seconds if a player attacks a regenerating creature and retreats (leaving the area entirely) without killing it and returns before the monster despawns (player would see an incorrect health percent for a few seconds upon returning before the script started running again)\n\nv1 to v2\n- Called with OnPerception when an enemy or PC approaches to avoid using resources until needed\n- Shuts down if all PCs leave the creature's area and starts back up when approached again\n- Calls itself every second by default once triggered (compared to previous 0.5 seconds), speeding up to 0.5 seconds if the creature is using MassiveHP and below 3000 raw hit points","Rating":9.5,"Votes":0,"Awards":[]}}
