Many of you probably never heard of Lord Badmagic, but he was a modeler from Oblivion, an Elder Scrolls series. When Badmagic came to the forums long ago and announced he was starting on NWN2 people were excited. After releasing one masterpiece, he announced he was going back to Oblivion. It was a sad time for me, as I enjoyed what he left behind and wanted more.\n\nAlas, Badmagic placed his files on a unreliable file-sharing site. Mega-Upload or something similar. I was one of the few people who actually kept the files, because I knew they would not keep for long. So now I'm sharing them to you all on the reliable NWNVault site; however that's not all I'm doing. I'm including several new files, along with the original untouched versions. The new files feature some lighter lipstick and eye shadow, to make it more noticeable on darker skin tones. Not only that, but I'm including some additional setups not in the original, such as red lipstick and black eye shadow, or tribal with red lipstick.\n\nI admit I'm not the best at retexturing, so you may not like the new ones I including, which is the reason I included the original unedited ones. Feel free to comment and I hope you enjoy, but please do not ask me to create any retextures for other faces. I'm not able of doing that, but feel free to use these to make your own.\n\nInstallation information is included in the zip file. \n\nTo Recap:\n\nThis includes the original work from Badmagic. These are a retexture of Human female head 04. They include a version with Dark Red Lipstick and Dark red Eyeshadow and a version with purplish-black lipstick, tattoo and purplish-black eyeshadow.\n\nMy updated versions which include:\n\nVersion with Light red lipstick and same eyeshadow.\n\nVersion with Lighter, more blackish lipstick with red eyeshadow.\n\nVersion with Light Red Lipstick, Tattoo and Black Eyeshadow.\n\nVersion with Light Red Lipstick and Black Eyeshadow.\n\n.\n\nRemember, if you don't like my retextures ( and I definitely wouldn't blame you if you didn't ), feel free to use the originals!","Rating":8.76,"Votes":26,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"14":{"Name":"Tepers Grass Dirt  Terrain Texture","Author":"Teper's or aadatepe","Submitted":20070105,"Updated":20070106,"Category":"Terrain","TextureFormat":"Obsidian Standard","Description":"Hi everybody, found this nice texture on the internet.
