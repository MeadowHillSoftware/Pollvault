wizard\nlevel 5 arcane archer\nand level 8 shadowdancer\n\nFirst i wanted to make a sneaking archer but only assassins and shadowdancers got the ability to hide when spectated so i choose shadowdancer ( cause of some skills i liked more )\n\nThe one class mage is because arcane archer needs arcane spells so i had to choose between sorcerer and wizard , but wizard has level 1 spell ( dont know english name , the one that boosts ur attack by 20 for 9 seconds ... ) and this makes my 8 attacks per round ( with haste ) hitting everytime \nbut even without this skill the attacks are 35/30/25/20 +1 haste + the first three ones are doubled cause of acrane archer skill\nthis makes 35/35/30/30/25/25/20/15(the haste one dont know if its 15 or 35 or whatever ... )\n\ntha char is skilled on longbow and makes\n1-8+10 +1 +5(magic arrows) damage .\n\nThe average damage on mobs is 23\n\ncrit. = 19-20 x3 and bow has massive crits. so crits do over 70 dmg ...\n\nThe char is skilled on traps and sneaking \n\nU can hide even if the enemy has already seen u allowing u to go on max range , shoot for examble 8 times ( one round ) and then after 6 secs u can hide again and the mob wont see u ^^\nand the game goes on ...\n\nThis even works on red dragons !!\n\nand cause ur drow u have 31 magic resistance !\n\nThe other way of fighting with this char is by traps , listen , u can also set up traps if ur sneaking that means u go near ur opponent , place some traps u can workship by urself or collect , and then show urself and when the enemy moves all the traps are gonna blow him up ^^\n\nThe char is already leveled up to 20 , has played through the campain and a complete inventory full of traps , weapons and arrows \n\nThis is my favorit char , when u like this one i will post

good ( tested vs 5 horned devils at once and he owned them all ^^ )\n\nand while parrying he can use his duelist ability flourish ( a bonus attack with normal damage +2w6 )\n\nhe can use flourish unlimited times a day with a cooldown of 12 secs ...\n\nHis damage is at\n1-6 + 13 + 4 + 1 \nthats an average of 21 \nAnd cause of his Weapon mastery he makes\ncrits at 17-20 x3 , dealing over 70 dmg

Unfortunately, I forgot to save the original when I did a clean reinstall of NWN2 and MotB. So, I had to rebuild her to play the expansion. Players who are more interested in the most optimal build will probably think this is the most ridiculous character ever, but I made her more with my specific role-play qualities in mind. So if you are more of the role-play oriented type, you may like her better.\n\nI was having trouble finding a character that I thought meshed well with the story of the OC. This was my concept in creating Soleil Aurore: She is a cleric of Lathander because I fancied that she had been enlightened by Brother Merring as she grew up in West Harbor. However, even though she is a pure cleric, she is more of a nature girl being as she is a Wood Elf and grew up in a swamp. She is an archer due to the influence of her �father.� As such, I gave her the domains Animal and Sun. So she has a brown bear animal companion, and I tried to fill her spell book with �sun� related spells. She is actually more like a ranger with feats focused around archery and tracking.

Now, you can play as Elric in Nwn2, complete with the soul-devouring black sword known as Stormbringer. I have based all of his stats off of two main sources: the D20 Dragon Lords of Melnibone sourcebook, and the listing for Elric from the Melnibonean Mythos section of the first edition of the old Deities and Demigods sourcebook. Within the limitations of Nwn2, the result is as accurate as depiction of Elric as is possible for the game.\n\nIncluded with Elric are Stormbringer, the Ring of Kings, and some gold. Elric's armor, is designed after the armor depicted in various comics and paintings of him.

Since Elric was an outcast amongst his own people, and the Half-Drow are always seen as outcasts, this choice just makes sense.\n\nI chose Cyric to be Elric's patron deity in Nwn2 for the following reason -\n1.

But let me explain the set of events that led up to his creation. \n\nI seem to have the insane tendency to create heavy armoured heroes that just jump into combat and hack at everything that moves until he or shes the last one standing, everything else dead, or incapacitated. This is all fine and dandy, but eventually as most people probably have noticed it gets old and rather boring. So I decided to attempt a multi versatile hero that can take on ten enemies at once as well as he can skulk down an alleyway or set ambushes and such like. This was very appealing for me at the time, having always used sword orientated characters. With a multi versatile character I could enjoy the game in many different ways that couldn�t before. .e.g. Crack some heads with Khelgar or go on stealth missions with Neeshka. \n\nWhat I conceived of was a jack of all trades character. A combination of a cheesy swashbuckler and the calm and collected rogue, I used a combination of different classes to achieve what I wished, Ranger, Arcane archer, rogue, Wizard. As you can guess, doing this limits the number of levels you can advance in each class, to a balanced 5, this in turn limits the number of feats available. Hence I was forced to �cheat� a bit by giving my hero feats that would not be available other wise. I used various hero creators to fashion him. Vordans hero creator was very useful. \n\nThe character that emerged was quite a bit of a surprise. An impulsive, head strong, I idealistic, Intelligent and a �sell sword� is what emerged. Usually my characters would be lawful, but in this case he turned out to be quite Chaotic, following his own code and doing what he thought to be right, regardless of the consequences, which usually involved quite a bit of resultant fighting or brawling. \n\n(Bear in mind this is my perception of the character and not a �split� personality ;] )\n\nTo complete my characters persona I thought about what voice set he should possess, I thought about the swashbuckler voices, but decided it was to, �swashbucklery�. Then I remembered the old nwn games character Valen (my characters name sake), I believed his voice set to be perfect. It suited the character too.\n\nI also borrowed some ideas from V for Vendetta; I thought the character of V was brilliant! \n\n(this character is overpowering, it was created to have fun, having challenging fights wasn�t really and issue when I created him)\n\nThe specs of my character\n\nName: Valen Oken-Shield \nGender: Male\nAge: --\nRace: Half-Elf\nLevel: 20 (can be re-adjusted using a character creator)\n\nFavoured weapons:\n\nScimitar and Knife\nDual Knifes\nDual Scimitars\nHeavy Bow\n\nClasses\n\nRanger: level 6\nArcane Archer: Level 5\nWizard: level 4\nRogue: level 5\n\n(Even although he doesn�t have the fighter class, he still has fighter Feats)\n\nAnyway it�s the first character that I�ve created that talks his own mind instead of me just using �him� as a puppet, which is quite cool.\n\n(I might even think about using his character in some fan fiction)\n\n(the pictures were taken within Vordans hero creator)\n\n~ Valandil\n\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"85":{"Name":"Stratigo","Author":"Stratigo","Submitted":20080203,"Updated":20080204,"Category":"Level 15-20","Challenge Rating":"NA","Alignment":"NA","Size":"NA","Gender":"NA","Scripts Included":"Yes","Class1":"NA / NA","Class2":"NA / NA","Class3":"NA / NA","Level1":"NA","Level2":"NA","Level3":"NA","Race":"NA","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"my guy","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"87":{"Name":"Rith Kalent","Author":"PoC","Submitted":20080210,"Updated":20080211,"Category":"Level 15-20","Challenge Rating":"NA","Alignment":"Chaotic Evil","Size":"Medium","Gender":"Female","Scripts Included":"No","Class1":"Fighter / 20","Class2":"NA / 03","Class3":"NA / 07","Level1":"20","Level2":"03","Level3":"07","Race":"Drow","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"This is one Drow you do NOT want to meet.\n\nThis Drow is A Fighter(20)/Blackguard(3)/Weapon Master(7) scythe specialist.\n\nSTR: 22\nDEX: 14\nCON: 10\nINT: 14\nWIS: 10\nCHA: 22\n\nskill points: I only put the bare minimum for the PrCs and put the rest where I wanted to.\n\nFeats: All the weapon focus/specilization, improved crit, Divine Might, Epic Divine Might,Great Str +4, and the prereqs for the PrCs.\n\nThoughts and comments would be very welcomed.\n\nPoC","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"88":{"Name":"Valain Orcsplitter - A Persistent Companion","Author":"powerboy","Submitted":20080229,"Updated":20080229,"Category":"Level 1-4","Challenge Rating":"NA","Alignment":"Chaotic Good","Size":"Small","Gender":"Male","Scripts Included":"Yes","Class1":"Fighter / 01","Class2":"NA / NA","Class3":"NA / NA","Level1":"01","Level2":"NA","Level3":"NA","Race":"Dwarf","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"This a a Persistent Companion that I made based on the FRW Persistent Companion system here on the vault.

Throughout the very formative ages of the Universe, through the Shadow Epoch, and through the war of the Days of Thunder, Rayna was the unseen counsel of Lord Ao, the Overgod and all his actions. Upon Lord Ao's declaration as The Hidden One, Rayna decided to travel through the realms within mortal shells, relishing the intricacies of laws that she helped incorporate into this world. With the ever present watchful eye of lord Ao, Rayna has traveled as a mortal among mortals, unbeknownst to any existing deities. Each end of her mortal shell was but a launch of another era. Through her Eons of travel, she experienced life, death, the weavings of mana and divinity, even a trip through the Maws of Kezef the Chaos Hound.\n\nIn all forms of existence, Rayna's unassuming appearance belies her amazing (mortal) abilities, such as the manipulation of legendary divine and arcane energies at her will, and physical prowess rivaling that of avatars of lesser deities. As her innate grace and charm was the basis for Ao's creation of all humanoid beauty, countless mortals from the lowest of heroes to the most powerful of gods have been attracted to the allure of Rayna's splendor. At will, Rayna can take to the shadows, and once she even crept by the scrutiny of Mask, the Lord of Shadows and Master of All Theives, without detection.\n\nRayna usually avoids fighting with lesser beings. If needed, Rayna refrains from using any weapons, and rather uses her magic and prowess in martial arts to carry the day. Rayna even eschews all armor and magical clothing, preferring to blend into the population with innocuous clothing of the peasantry.\n\nRayna, as the foremost witness and consort to lord Ao, the Overgod, continues her travels for now and ever.\n\n-----\nThis character was devised as a creative exercise to find the most powerful character possible within NWN2 without using any equipment, and without depending on pre-edited values that become nullified after you save the character or rest even once within the game. What this means is that the character can be saved or rested without any trouble. \n\nEver since I first uploaded this character several weeks ago, the character has gone through several renditions. First, she was devised as a hellfire warlock, as level 30 hellfire blast would give 60d6 shots. Unfortunately, it cannot go through the high AC of the other characters. So, second, she was devised as a character that's focused in unarmed strike, a monk/sacred fist/duelist. As I was working on this variation, I discovered that I could incorporate cleric levels to counter both shadow simulacrum and heal himself to full multiple times. So the final version, Rayna the Eternal, is a monk/cleric hybrid, with sacred fist and duelist levels. You can see the comments section to see the thought process I went through as I made this character. \n\n\nCharacter basics:\n1 Monk/10 Cleric/3 Sacred Fist/16 Duelist\nRock Gnome\nAlignment: True Neutral\nStarting Package: Assassin\nBackground: Devout\n\nRayna�s race is gnome, because what�s funnier than a tiny female gnome with no equipment and only simple clothes destroying huge demons armed with �swords that could cleave even the soul� (Balor)?\n\n\nRayna is designed as a character that should be played completely without any weapons. She instead has been given 50 in every stats, 100 in every skill, and every beneficial feat. In an effort to decrease the file size and bugginess, I went through the effort to go through every single feat available in the game and specifically only gave the feats that would confer an advantage to the character.\n\nRayna has absolutely NO armor, shield, or weapon proficiencies! (not even simple!)\n\nRayna has been given 1 Monk/10 Cleric/3 Sacred Fist/16 Duelist. The Duelist Levels are to take maximum advantage of one of the two feats to give AC bonus according to level, Canny Defense (1737). The cleric levels give access to word of faith and Greater Restoration. Finally, the single level of monk is required to take advantage of the monk lawful/magic/adamantine fists and flurry of blow feats. Sacred fist improves the cleric levels, improves monk fast movement and unarmed damage, and gives full BaB bonus. \n\nWhen fully buffed, Rayna has 123 AC, 75 AB, 1507/1298 HP and all saves at 118. With Flurry of blows and haste activated, she hits 9 times each round.\n\nSome other highlights include:\n1. Several contingency plans: the panic button Frenzy which prevents death for 23 rounds per cast up to 9x/day, greater restoration 6x/day, ethereal jaunt, invisibility etc\n2. Song of requiem for up to 100 sonic damage per enemy in an area + healing to every ally in the area 24x a day, cannot be saved/prevented/evaded\n5. Immunity to nearly every condition (immunity to every condition when buffed)\n6. Spell resistance 66\n7. Epic Divine Might, Epic Divine Shield 35x/day\n8. Class Specific Combat Feats such as Shadow Daze, Insidious Attack, Impromptu Sneak Attack, as well as epic combat feats such as expose weakness, Last Stand\n9. Class specific combat modes such as Dwarven Defender Defensive Stance, Hellfire Shield\n10. 50% self concealment\n11. All available energy immunity 100/-(acid, cold, electrical, fire, sonic)\n12. Damage resistance that adds up to 50+/x\n13. Haste 10x/day at level 30 class level\n14. All useful feat-like and cleric buffs\n15. Unlimited quickened, silenced, stilled 100+damage eldritch blast touch atacks\n16. Unarmed no equipment damage averaging 100 per hit\n17. Hide in Plain Sight\n18. Immune to criticals\n19. Base movespeed changed to DM speed\n20. And many others...\n\nHer clothes have been modified so that her hands are not covered with any gloves, and it is visually evident that she is not wearing any equipment other than a utility belt.\n\nHer scale has been changed to 0.75 to emphasize the tininess, and the irony with which something so small can defeat the mightiest of demons and sorcerers.\n\nShe has been given a pair of white wings and a tail that sync perfectly with her fluid combat movements.\n\nShe has been given Kaelyn's voiceset, as her tone and her vocal manner is the one that I find the most attractive as a female voice.\n\nI have organized the quickcast bars in the following manner to optimize your playing experience:\n\nThe big, two-rowed horizontal bar:\nOffensive capacity spells--permanent buffs\n(comparatively) long term buffs--short term buffs\n\nThe small horizontal bar:\nCombat spells and direct attack abilities\n\nTwo vertical bars:\nEscape spells and healing spells\n\nFurther, the spells have been organized according to their duration such that they could be maximally utilized, if you go from outside to in.\n\n\nThe character files come in several flavors.\nArayna the eternal is the full level 30 character with every effective feat.\n\nBrayna of the fists is a level 30 character with adjusted history feats for use in the Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir campaigns.\n\nCrayna the eternal is a level 20 character with adjusted history feats for use in the original campaign.\n\n\nEach character comes with a �bag of everything� that contains the best possible item of each category that can be found in game, such that you can equip your cohorts, if you wish. It also has a set of \"Rayna's Subtle Blessings,\" charms that confer immortality to whoever that holds it. But once again, the bags of everything are only there as an option, and I recommend that you play this character without any items equipped.\n\nHave fun.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: To clarify, this character is NOT intended to be an \"Uber.\" The character has absolutely no weapon, armor, or shield proficiencies. It is definitely intended to be used within the context of normal \"epic\" adventuring. And I believe that, as long as the strict rp-ing rule of no equipment is followed, she will be fine in most epic-level modules.\n\nAnd unlike any \"uber\" character currently seen in the site, this character can be saved and rested with no trouble.\n\n\n\nNOTE!!!! READ THIS!!!!\nThe character works fine without any mods. However...\nFor the best experience with the specially organized UI, you need Charlie's UI interface that can be found here in NWNvault. Otherwise, under normal nwn UI, the hotbar won't make much sense, although the character will still definitely work.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------\nChangelog\n05/02/09\nBUGFIX: Flurry of Blows do not work on any character with 0 monk levels.\nI have removed the feats and have re-uploaded the entire set.\n\n05/03/09\nBUGFIX: Removed several more useless feats in further efforts to decrease the filesize.\n\nAlso: Added an \"alternative visual style\" set that further emphasizes the no-equipment style of the character (basically, the headband/belt/gloves have been removed, and the default clothes have been changed into the bikini-style skimpy swimsuit)\nThis set also removes the buggy tail and wings.\nThe original set will be kept uploaded for the people who want to use the visual look.\n\n05/04/09\nCompletely revamped into a more unarmed combat oriented character. Definitely much more powerful than the first rendition.\n\n05/04/09\nAArrgghh. I can't make up my mind whether or not to keep the circlet on the character. It definitely looks nice, but I wonder if it detracts from the character's proposed \"unarmored, no equipment\" style. For the time being I have kept it in.\nI have also changed the starting package of the characters into \"assassin.\" This makes the character even more unique, as the character sheet will list her as an assassin :)\n\n05/08/09\nAnother complete revamp! Incorporated a combined total of 13 cleric spellcasting levels to give access to word of faith and greater restoration. \n\n05/14/09\nA small update that gives Spell Resistance 61.\n\n05/15/09\nChanged the background to \"Devout\" to take advantage of the +1 will saving throws. \n\n05/16/09\nChanged the base movespeed to fastest in the game. \n\n05/17/09\nAdded an alternative build that focuses on survival through etherealness, and using shadow simulacrum/song of requiem to deal damage.\nThe build uses reduce person to become virtually unclickable... But really has no way to deal damage other than shadow simulacrum. This is the \"ultimate unarmed survival\" build. \n\n05/17/09\nPruned some more feats, edited the character level history to show that all stats, skills, and feats were maxed at character creation.\n\n05/22/09\nAdded Rescue combat mode, which gives an additional damage resistance 5/-, as well as an additional feat that gives a total spell resistance of 66!\nAlso, removed a few useless feats.\n\n05/23/09\nAdded death ward, to guard against the MotB specific history feat Spiritual Evisceration. (It deals negative energy, and death ward grants immunity to negative energy.)\nAlso improved the hotbar organization. \n\n05/29/09\nI realize that the hellfire warlock seems to be (more popular than others) so I want to make a comment...\n\n\nThe biggest thing about the hellfire warlock is that it is a ranged touch attack, i.e. it is affected by AC. The character gets absolutely ridiculous touch attack AC, due to the various AC given by feats. Even though it is a touch attack and not affected by shield/armor/natural AC, the AC level possible far outstrips any AB level possible. So... I unfortunately don't see a way that the hellfire warlock may be the most powerful.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"103":{"Name":"Abraxas, the God Hunter","Author":"Orgolove","Submitted":20090531,"Updated":20090603,"Category":"Level 15-20","Challenge Rating":"110","Alignment":"Neutral","Size":"Medium","Gender":"Male","Scripts Included":"Yes","Class1":"Warlock / 30","Class2":"NA / NA","Class3":"NA / NA","Level1":"30","Level2":"NA","Level3":"NA","Race":"Other","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"On the first day of creation, the Supreme Being bestowed upon the roaring storm of primal matter a sense of order, thereby creating sentient centers with portions of the Creator's power. Each being oversaw a crystal sphere as their eminent domain, and countless such spheres populated across the now pristine edges of the cosmos. And so the multiverse came to being, each god with a name and a symbol of their realms, among them Ao and the Abeir-Toril, Titans and the Great Dark of Azeroth, the Cetra and Gaia, and the myriad others that have since occupied the multiverse. And the creator saw that it was good, and laid down his tools for a reprieve.\nIn his place, the Creator infused a portion of his will, a sentience and comprehension of all origination, as an equal, an impartial judge of all his first creations. For the Overgods themselves would not be content with merely a crystal sphere of void; even the most impassive lord may redefine his territory with his own mandates. The Creator, above all, wills for a continued existence of the totality of his creation, and in his absence, a contingency was established to maintain this overarching purpose of the multiverse. \nAnd thus, Abraxas, the God Hunter, the judge of all Cosmos, was born as the embodiment of the decree, the will above all Overgods across the macrocosm. With this final genesis, the Creator laid to rest, as a sea of endless calm after the infinite eons of god-creation. \nAbraxas, as the prime council over the actions of all Overgods, has ascended across the endless ages of the multiverse, to ensure the preservation of the Creator's work. Only after his visit would the Overgods know of it and gain relief, for Abraxas, as the final administrator of the Creator's Judgment, holds the ultimate authority to terminate an Overgod. \nSome Overgods, after guiding their worlds astray, would annihilate their own creations to escape Abraxas' inevitable attention - and yet, with but a breath, the terrible sundering of their very existence, were made certain by the will of the Creator. \nAbraxas carries the understanding of a multiverse so vast as to be immeasurable - incomprehensible even to the greatest godly minds. The very fury of cosmos, the power behind the ultimate tools of creation, lies in her hands. As Abraxas is the universe, an extension of the Creator, an apparent \"death\" is but a simple matter of returning to his body. Although he appears most often as an eccentric, but otherwise normal, floating skull, in his mind are the witnessing of the rise and fall of countless gods, the birth and extinction of entire worlds. He carries the chaos of the cosmos with every strike, and any being judged for destruction faces the true face of death, an end to both the being and the world that dared contain it. \nThe God Hunter has now set his focus on Ao, as he has watched over countless such deviant Overgods before. Ao was one of the Creator's most promising Overgods, but his hand in the \"spellplague\" of Abeir-Toril, and the complete eradication of all that once supported the continued existence of Ao's domain, has been judged as the ultimate betrayal of the Creator's purpose. \nThe moment Abraxas begins his judgement, the fate of Ao, the \"Overgod\" has been sealed. Indeed, the very essence of Ao, as a being, has crossed the precipice of oblivion. As the God Hunter heralds the end of this world, Ao shall stare blindly into the bottomless abyss of devastation until the very end. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen I first saw the giant skull model, I knew that I had to make a character that uses the model. Who DOESN'T want to play a disembodied skull that head butts, head smashes, and has a magical breath weapon at will?\n\nAppearance and cosmetics:\nAbraxas' \"eye-gems\" are smoked grey, as that was the closest I could get to giving a \"Transparent gem\" look. Abraxas' fangs are green, to evoke the look of jade. Abraxas' \"skull\" was given a slight golden tinge, because a completely white color just seemed too bland. \nHe was given Okku's voiceset, as his is the most FERAL and WILD - matching the image I have for this character. \n\nJUST IMAGINE:\nA giant floating skull that's as large as your height, shouting \"I shall rend you limb from limb!\" and breathing fire from its mouth! \n\n\nCharacter Statistics/Summary:\nAbraxas is an Epic Hellfire Warlock that takes advantage of the 2d6/level progression of Hellfire Blast to the maximum, meaning he shoots the regular 14d6 eldritch blast+ epic 10d6 eldritch blast + 60d6 hellfire blast + eldritch master, for a total of 126d6 per blast, all quickened, stilled, and silenced. The hellfire blasts, at will, are shot out of Abraxas' mouth, much like a dragon's breath weapon - except it does not allow a saving throw, and is a ranged touch attack. The \"Breath Weapon\" deals on average 450 magical damage per shot. \nFurther, Abraxas has all relevant class/race specific buffs at his disposal, allowing him to reach 103 AC, 121 AB, 1448/1291 health, all saves at 100 or more, and 7 attacks per round that deal nearly as much damage as his breath weapon (but subject to full AC, rather than just touch AC). \nAbraxas' character background was set to Bully, to take advantage of the increased saving throw. As an animal creature, Abraxas cannot be turned or be made a favored enemy, and most hostile spells simply pass through him (66 spell resistance). Further, spells specifically designed for animals, such as Nature's Avatar and Magic Fang, can be cast directly on the character. \nDue to his innate connection with the forces of chaos in the universe, each physical attack has an innate chance to dispel all magic and knockdown the enemy, equivalent to automatic casts of Greater Spell Breach and Forceful Hand at 40th caster levels. \nAs a disembodied skull, Abraxas does not need to speak invocations or wave his hands to cast his spells - he has perfect still/silent/quicken metamagic feats for all his buffs and breath. \nDue to his floating nature, most movement impairments/hindrances do not bother him - In fact, he can move at the fastest possible speed within the game. \nAs a manifestation of the forces of Creation, Abraxas has nigh complete immunity to most types of damage. Nothing can be hidden from his eyes, as his piercing gaze understands the most fundamental laws that formulate the fabric of universe. \nThe gems that are apparent on Abraxas' surface serve as conduits to the power of Universe, allowing infinite empowerments above all mortal powers. \n\nThe Hotbar has been organized for your playing pleasure. Note that this organization will only work if you have Charlie's UI mode installed - if not, the character will still work, but the hotbar may not make much sense.\n\nThe giant horizontal bar:\nMajor hostile attacks----- Nigh Permanent buffs\nTemporary Buffs, in the order of Longest Duration --- Shortest Duration\n\nThe Small Horizontal bar:\nPrimary modes of attack/Feats used as a part of an attack\n\nThe vertical bars:\nEscape/Healing Spells\n\nNotable is Frenzy, which prevents death even from lethal damage for 20 rounds a shot, 20+ times a day. \n\nThis character builds on my previous model of \"most powerful character without equipment\" by utilizing the creature hide/claw system. By editing directly the hide and claw of the character, no equipment is needed to create the ultimate character, a character that could destroy Overgods as the herald of Creator. \n\nUnlike custom classes, the race/appearance of the character can be customized in any way you want without compromising the ability to join campaigns or other modules - Thus, this character can be used in any module or campaign without trouble. \n\nAAbraxas the God Hunter is the complete character, ready for use in other epic modules.\nBAbraxas the God Hunter is optimized for SoZ/MotB official Campaigns.\nCAbraxas the God Hunter is optimized for the Original Campaign. \n\n\nOnce again, this character has no proficiency other than creature weapon, and no armor/shield proficiencies. He is designed to be used \"as is,\" without any other equipment or armor. As long as this rule is upheld, he should provide an enjoyable experience. \n\n\nOh, and the story is sort of a jab at the new 4th edition DnD, which in my opinion completely eviscerates all that was good in Dungeons and Dragons and degenerates the entire system into something completely ridiculous. \n\nRegarding \"Uber\": Unlike other characters that are supposedly \"uber,\" this character can be rested, saved, and exported to other modules with no trouble. \n\nCHANGELOG\n06/03/09\nSome Fixes... most notably, I had not changed the race and background of BAbraxas the God Hunter and CAbraxas the God Hunter.

Her sparkling eyes and gossamer wings give her an otherworldly charm the belies her true nature, a champion of the Creator himself, charged with mediating the infinite multiversal chronoplanes across time and space in his stead. Since the very first creation of the multiverse, Divinus has policed the timeways, protecting them from interlopers, restoring them to their proper place, and maintaining the balance of time. Divinus constantly polices the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny, and often disguises her true form and hides herself in the form of a small sylph, entering humanoid societies to keep the time stream inviolate and ensure that the order of events would progress as the fates intended. Not that Divinus ever disliked her duties - she enjoys interacting with mortal societies for extended periods of time, actively involving herself with the communities she joined and lending a hand in order to maintain the safety of the present world at large. \n\nBy drawing upon the very threads of time itself, every blow of Divinus' power directly damages a target regardless of strength or immunity. Fondly called \"pocket god\" by her closest friends, Divinus has manipulated the threads of time to synchronize the experiences of multiple versions of herself into a single individual, and thus can heal and resurrect entire worlds with a single wave of her hand. \n\nIn all, Divinus forever keeps watch over occupied regions to watch the development of time and monitor how events impact the progress of fate. Her timeless duty as the final watcher of the chronoplanar multiverse is an eternal evidence of the Creator's power.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nI humbly submit to you Divinus Fatereaper, the mighty faerie. Envisioned as the solution to anything and everything, the ultimate killer that can destroy even the worst edited \"uber\" challenges brought on by either the DM or any other foolish challenger. \n\nAbsolutely no custom works required - you can download this character and play it in a freshly installed and patched NWN2, if you choose. \n\n\nBut before we go into that.\n\nDivinus is a female Faerie whose character level is at 30 yet can cast 9th level divine magic as both a 23rd level cleric as well as 24th level favored soul. \n\nAnd this took a lot of work: \n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nEvery single equipment used by Divinus is personalized with their own names and descriptions, and their own icons. A LOT of lore is packed into them. I hope you enjoy them.\n\n\n\n\nEach artifact carried by Divinus is a reflection of the power of the Creator, and greatly amplifies Divinus' spellcasting capabilities. Further, each artifact embodies a specific aspect of the chronoplane multiverse, and thus gives Divinus the stability of the very reality and time itself at her disposal. Each artifact listed below with 'Will of the Chronoplane' in its description has the following attributes:\nBonus Spell Slot of every spell level for Clerics and Favored Souls\nBonus Hit Points +50\nRegeneration +20\nWeight Reduction, -80%\n\n\nIn addition, each artifact bestows special powers upon the wearer, as listed below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, with the items:\n\n\nFatereaper's Helm\nThe Fatereaper's Legacy, a collective name given to a set of artifacts of otherworldly power collected by the fatereaper throughout her journies, combined provide near invincibility to all malicious forces that attempt to destroy the chronoplane. This circlet, in addition to providing an invisible field of force aound the wearer, improves all aspects of its wearer's presence in the world - magnetic leadership, unending stamina, masterly agility, boundless knowledge, physical power, and limitless willpower. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\n+20 AC Bonus (Deflection)\nSpell Immunity: Lesser Dispel\n+12 to all attributes\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Raiment\nThe Fatereaper's Legacy, a collective name given to a set of artifacts of otherworldly power collected by the fatereaper throughout her journies, combined provide near invincibility to all malicious forces that attempt to destroy the chronoplane. These shirt and pants not only gives an impenetrable, shimmering sphere of protection around the wearer but also causes any harm done, physical or magical, to be deflected into a condensed chronoplane of primal energies that completely diffuse the damage. This translates into complete immunity to almost any weapon, magical spell, or divine invocation attempted against its wearer. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\n+20 AC Bonus (Armor)\nSpell Immunity, Mordenkainen's Disjunction\n100% Immunity to Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Divine, Electrical, Fire, Magical, Negative, Piercing, Positive, Slashing, Sonic damage\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Treads\nThe Fatereaper's Legacy, a collective name given to a set of artifacts of otherworldly power collected by the fatereaper throughout her journies, combined provide near invincibility to all malicious forces that attempt to destroy the chronoplane. These pair of boots automatically guide its wearer out of any harms way, augmenting its wearer's reflexes and providing complete avoidance against any blows and other ill effects. Further, as a manifestation of a plane of speed that was home to a race of time travellers, these boots provide its wearer with a constant awareness of the fastest method to achieve any means necessary. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\n+20 AC Bonus (Dodge)\nSpell Immunity, Lesser Spell Breach\nHaste\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Clutch\nThe Fatereaper's Legacy, a collective name given to a set of artifacts of otherworldly power collected by the fatereaper throughout her journies, combined provide near invincibility to all malicious forces that attempt to destroy the chronoplane.

This cloak is actually a marvel of engineering crafted by master craftsmen from a world of technology, and serves as a mobile portal that can be opened at will to a mirror plane of the current reality. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\nSpell Immunity: Grease\nImproved Saving Throws: Universal +20\nAt Will: Etherealness (18), Unlimited Uses\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Seal\nThe Fatereaper's Legacy, a collective name given to a set of artifacts of otherworldly power collected by the fatereaper throughout her journies, combined provide near invincibility to all malicious forces that attempt to destroy the chronoplane. This ring contains within a mechanism to manipulate the fundamental constants that govern the physical and metaphysical aspects of the chronosphere. It detects any hostility and subverts the attempt from ever affecting its wearer. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\nSpell Immunity: Dispel Magic\nSpell Immunity to Spells: Level 9 or lower\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Insigna\nThe Fatereaper's Legacy, a collective name given to a set of artifacts of otherworldly power collected by the fatereaper throughout her journies, combined provide near invincibility to all malicious forces that attempt to destroy the chronoplane. This ring is embedded with a gem that embodies a regenerating portion of the primordial power that first created the multiverse. By merely touching any injury or illness with the gem, the universe itself wills the subject into complete stabilization and recovery. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\nSpell Immunity: Greater Dispel Magic\nFreedom of Movement\nAt Will: Greater Restoration (13), Unlimited Uses\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Sign\nThe Fatereaper's Legacy, a collective name given to a set of artifacts of otherworldly power collected by the fatereaper throughout her journies, combined provide near invincibility to all malicious forces that attempt to destroy the chronoplane. This necklace bestows upon its wearer a measure of the inevitability in the makings of the multiverse, optimizing the toughness and protection against multiple foes. Further, by allowing the wearer to gaze into fundamental laws that weave the chronoplanes, this artifact gives anything that feels the gaze of Divinus to be forcefully manifested into visible form. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\n+20 AC Bonus (Natural)\nSpell Immunity: Invisibility Purge\nTrue Seeing\nAt Will: Shield (5), Unlimited uses\n\n\n\n\n\nFatekeeper's Forge\nThe Fatereaper's Legacy, a collective name given to a set of artifacts of otherworldly power collected by the fatereaper throughout her journies, combined provide near invincibility to all malicious forces that attempt to destroy the chronoplane. This belt, once worn by an interplanar gladiator that sought and defeated champions of entire multiverses, provides the wearer a measure of the power that once sundered worlds, destroyed entire islands with a single blow. At will, the belt can enhance the wearer's attacks with supernatural proficiency, allowing strikes directly into the most volatile cores of the enemy. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\nSpell Immunity: Bigby's Forceful Hand\nSkill Bonus: Concentration, Heal, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Parry, Spellcraft, Spot, Taunt, Tumble +50\nAt Will: Divine Power (7), Unlimited Uses\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Journal\nEver since Divinus' first ascension intto the Fatereaper many beginnings of the universe ago, Divinus has kept meticulous notes of every quest she has ever undertaken. Protected with energy that could even survive the destruction of the entire multiverse and back, this journal is one of the few personal belongings that Divinus truly values, apart from her gem collection. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Command/Fatekeeper's Rule\nThis weapon, one of a pair of identical Kamas crafted by the very same craftsmen who created the Chronolauncher in a multiverse far advanced in technology than Abeir Toril, is embedded with impossibly advanced machinery that automatically adjusts the direction and guidance of its bearer to hit the target at its weakest point, with an accuracy that can distinguish differences down to the atomic level. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\nAttack Bonus +20\nMaterial: Metal (Adamantine)\nVampiric Regeneration +20\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Chronolauncher\nThis bow, an artifact of a multiverse far advanced in technology than Abeir Toril, is teeming with nanogears that automatically adjust for the wind, temperature, and the user's direction to enable a surgical strike into the heart of the enemy. \n\nWill of the Chronoplane\nAttack Bonus +20\nMighty +20\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Chronofragments, 65535 shots\n\nThese arrows, a gift from one of Divinus' comrades during the war of the stars, seemingly perfectly seeks its path into the target no matter where or how it is launched. With careful control, Divinus can use these arrows to precisely strike a target with minimal damage into the order of the timeplane. \n\nMaterial: Metal (Adamantine)\nVampiric Regeneration +20\nWeight Reduction: -80%\n\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Pillow\n\nAcquired during a mission into the parallel chronoplane within which the center of the multiverse nearly sundered upon itself, this pillow, actually a mass of primordial matter collected from the mission, is one of the few creature comforts indulged by Divinus.\n\nBonus Hitpoints +50\n\n\n\n\nFatereaper's Baubles of Divinity I-XX\n\nThis gem is a part of a set of thousands of such baubles. In it contains a condensed essence of the noble sacrifice and martyrdom of one of the countless heroes whom Divinus traveled with throughout her unending watch over the chronoplanes. Each gem is a record of joyful memories and boundless nostalgia Divinus, and through them, Divinus channels her greatest strength, the companionship of every champion of the multiverse.\n\nWill of the Chronoplane\n\n\n\n\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nOthers:\nThanks to her incorporeal, flying nature, she cannot be made a favored enemy, and she ignores most movement impairments/hindrances - she can fly at the fastest possible speed within the game.\n\nAmazingly, Atari has completed a full set of animations for the sylph model used by this character. What this means is that the character has unique casting, flying, and attacking animations, unlike most other non-player models within the game. \n\nHer voiceset was given as Chir Darkflame, a SoZ Cohort. Her voice sounds the most suitable for a \"sylph\" type character.\n\nThanks to Divinus' ability to synchronize herself with every version of her own being across the chronoplane multiverse, she has every possible class/race specific feats at her disposal, all representing the various lives her alternate selves have led. \n\nBy always having the weavings of time at her disposal, Divinus is both immune to nearly every type of damage and deception, and further, can deal damage that bypasses all immunities and resistances to strike where it hurts the most. \n\nFor more details, please look at the screenshots of the character stats. \n\n\nThe Hotbar has been organized for your playing pleasure. Note that this organization will only work if you have Charlie's UI mode installed - if not, the character will still work, but the hotbar may not make much sense.\n\nThe giant horizontal bar:\nHealing spells\nImportant buffs that do not overlap nor count towards the bonus limit in attack bonus, saving throw bonus, AC bonus, from long duration to small duration\n\nThe Small Horizontal bar:\nPrimary modes of attack, including the only way to deal damage (Divine power, Expose Weakness)\n\nThe vertical bars:\nEscape Spells \n\nAs before:\n\nUnlike custom classes, the race/appearance of the character can be customized in any way you want without compromising the ability to join campaigns or other modules - Thus, this character can be used in any module or campaign without trouble.\n\n\n\nADivinus Fatereaper is the complete character, ready for use in other epic modules.\nBDivinus Fatereaper is optimized for the Original Campaign. \nCDivinus Fatereaper is optimized for SoZ/MotB official Campaigns.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------- \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is the rationale for the character, and my claim that it is the most powerful possible character in neverwinter nights 2.\n\n\nThe Background: \n\n\nRegarding Physical Combat\n\nPremise 1\nAbility scores can only go up to 50. This means the ability modifier can only go up to +20.\nSkill levels can only go up to 100.\nEach \"bonus\" type to AC or AB is limited to 20. Further, There are many more types of AC bonuses than AB bonuses. \nAll combat is affected by concealment, and there are no permanent affects in NWN2 that allow one to ignore concealment.\n\nPremise 2\nWhen all AC and AB bonuses are maxed for any type of character, the AC bonus will always far outstrip the AB bonus, leading regular combat to be a simple dependence upon a roll of 20.\nWith the addition of 50% concealment, participating in regular combat becomes nothing but a luck based coin flip.\nFurther, physical combat requires a target to hit, and etherealness removes the ability to target. \nTherefore, conventional combat is futile. \n\n\n\nRegarding Magical Combat\n\nPremise 3\nThe maximum DC possible for any spell is less than 50.\nThe maximum Saving Throw bonus available to any character is 118.\nThe maximum Caster level available for any spell is 39. Spell penetration raises this to 45.\nThe maximum spell resistance possible is 66.\nThe maximum possible damage output, magic wise, is 60d6, given an extreme example of 30 levels of Hellfire Warlock. \n\nPremise 4\nAny and all spells that depend on reflex saves are rendered ineffective.\nAny and all spells that depend on spell resistance are rendered ineffective. \nThe few spells that have no save and do not depend on spell resistance can be defended specifically using item properties. \nTherefore, all magical combat efforts are futile. \n\n\n\nRegarding Stealth\n\nPremise 5\nThe maximum skill level of all skills is 100. This includes hide and Spot.\nTrue seeing is available as a permanent affect. \n\nPremise 6\nWith Keen senses that force 6 opposes spot and hide checks per round, any hiding creature is instantly spotted.\nTherefore, all non-ethereal stealth based combat is futile. \n\n\n\nRegarding damage and health\n\nPremise 7\nThe maximum health bonus possible for each item type is 50.\nThe maximum damage bonus possible for each item type is 40*12 damage types=360. \nBoth damage and health bonuses can be stacked onto \"charms\" which give bonuses when placed within the inventory, even without being equipped. \n\nPremise 8\nThe total damage bonus is far higher than the total health bonus possible through items. \nWith each additional charm in the inventory, the damage capacity is increased by an additional 310 damage. \nEach inventory slot gives 64 spaces, multiplied by 2=128 spaces possible, each giving 310 damage. This sums up to 39680 total damage possible with each shot. \nThis leads to the only consideration to be that of damage immunity. \n\n\nRegarding damage immunity\n\nPremise 9\nItems allow a 100% damage immunity to each damage type. \nOnly two sources of damage will go through 100% damage immunity: damage from Divine Might, and damage from Expose Weakness. \n\nPremise 10\nBoth of these sources use physical attacks, and thus physical attacks are the only sources of real damage to an enemy if they have 100% immunity to each energy damage as well as slashing, bludgeoning, piercing, divine, negative energy, positive energy, and magic type damage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus:\n\n\n\n\nRegarding damaging enemies\n\npremise 11\nIn a duel, given maximum optimization, the only way for physical attacks to hit is on a roll of 20. \n\nPremise 12\nThus, the focus becomes to cause the most number of possible rolls within each round. \n\n\nRegarding probability\n\nPremise 13\nGiven a certain probability of rolling a 20 (5%), the more times you roll, the more times you will get a roll of 20.\nEach time you attack, you get a roll of 20.\n\nPremise 14\nFlurry of blows and dual wielding, and base attack bonus, are the only ones that affect the number of attacks in a round.\nFlurry of blows and dual wielding stack only with Kamas, and only if you have at least one level of monk. Base attack bonus can be increased only if you cast divine power. \nIn terms of ranged combat, only manyshot, rapid shot and base attack bonus affects the number of attacks. \nDivine power can only be cast through divine caster levels, as item-cast divine power only lasts for 8 rounds, negating any additional chances of rolling due to the time loss taken to cast the spells. \n\n\nConclusion: \nPremise 15\nIn melee combat, the only way to defeat any optimized character is to use maximum divine might and expose weakness, then apply Flurry of blows with dual wielded kamas, plus divine power cast through high caster levels. \nIn ranged combat, the only way to defeat any optimized character is to use maximum divine might and manyshot, then rapid shot and one shot to negate arrow deflection abilities, added with divine power. \nIt is possible to \"double up\" on caster levels by using prestige classes - due to the fact that stormlord levels count for all types of divine caster level progression, having a 20th level cleric and 20th level favored soul spells per day all within one character is possible with appropriate setup. \n\nPremise 16\nThus, Divinus Fatereaper, with 1 level of monk to allow Flurry of Blows, and 9 Cleric/10 Favored Soul/10 Stormlord for maximum number of divine power castings and greater restoration possibilities, is the solution to everything. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding tactics:\n\n\nRegarding the targeting system of NWN\n\nPremise 17\nBeing Ethereal causes all targeted spells, abilities, and attacks to fail, even if visible. \nEthereal characters cannot be hit or targeted, but can be seen. Etherealness disappears once a hostile action is taken, or is dispelled.\n\nPremise 18\nBecoming ethereal, followed by automatically quickened greater restoration, will not cancel the etherealness and allow you to re-enter combat at your leisure. \n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the other feats included in the character that do not directly contribute to combat, as described above\n\nPremise 19\nNo matter the situation, there may be a DM Fiat that depends on any non-essential skill or spell, in an effort to affect the outcome of the match. Further, in any custom campaign or module, it is guaranteed that combat may not solve every problem.\n\nPremise 20\nInsomuch as to come on top of every possibility, maxing of non-combat aspect of the character is a prerequisite to declaring the character as \"the Solution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the use of temporary edited stats that are reset after resting or saving, and custom 2das\n\nPremise 21\nAs shown, there is no value on any temporal stats or health levels, given that if the battle goes on as anticipated, resting is inevitable. \n\nPremise 22\nIf we go to the argument of custom 2das, I could just as easily say that I can edit the game data files to make one weapon automatically hit an opponent, without a check, for unresistable damage equal to the target's full health. For the sake of accurately comparing the capabilities of any character, it is necessary to avoid this escalation. \n\n\n\n\nRegarding the character's use in non-epic modules\nPremise 23\nOther than the complete and utter immunity to everything, this character's damage output is no greater than those of regular, level 30-40 epic adventurers. Therefore, the character can easily be used with enjoyment in normal, non-uber modules as well as defeat anything in uber-level modules, due to her ability to deal damage that ignores any and all immunity/reduction. \n\n\n\nThe next time an obnoxious player claims that he is \"uber,\" you can convince them otherwise, and without relying on temporary edited values that are eliminated upon saving or resting. \n\n\n\nA WORD OF CAUTION:\nDo not memorize any more spells other than those listed within the spellbook. While it is possible to memorize more in-game, if you exceed the spellbook limit, the game crashes upon reloading or export/importing the character.\n\n\nCHANGELOG:\n---------------------------------------\n06/22/09\n\nAdded DDivinus the Fatereaper, a version of the character optimized for the Mysteries of Westgate expansion module. \n\n---------------------------------------","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"105":{"Name":"The Impossible Class semi-uber Character","Author":"Teppanyaki","Submitted":20090803,"Updated":20090808,"Category":"Level 15-20","Challenge Rating":"NA","Alignment":"Neutral","Size":"NA","Gender":"Male","Scripts Included":"Yes","Class1":"Wizard / 20","Class2":"Wizard / 29","Class3":"Warlock / 01","Level1":"20","Level2":"29","Level3":"01","Race":"Human","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This is an uber built for annihilating just about everything.

Small note Septimund has a lesser version of his starter items as well as his starter items that also demand the prestige class.

All NPCs should be dressable according to their race model for ease of use.\n\n1. Big and Beautiful NPCs with size diversity. (good for breaking up the boring \"every PC is tiny/thin\" monotony. Also good proof how to make thick/fat PCs via editing their size porportions to these ratios in their bics directly.\n\n2. Baby/Toddler pack\nAll races resized and babyish looking heads chosen for use as children in games.\n\nIF someone was very clever they could utilize one of these as a familiar then attach it to an item to be a summonable and interactive PC child.

Ever wonder what happened to that golem you made?","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]}}
