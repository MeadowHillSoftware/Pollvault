My ideas on this was an area where level 1-5 creatures could lurk while providing places where you could have early level characters go to complete quests. My idea on having the small farm was to have the farmer have the players kill the \"corn beetles\" that are eating his crops. This could be a mini-quest that could involve a reward of both experience and a small amount of gold. I am aware that the bridges don't work-if someone could help me figure out why I would appreciate it. \n\nIn one corner I have also placed a row of trees where a path could go into the forest.

I would have removed them, but I figured that people would utilize them or remake them.\n\nHere's what comes in the package:\n\n- Dragon's Lair area, 8x12. There are MANY special effects in here, and all the placeables are set to enviromental and are not able to be interacted with. The walkmesh has been optimized so that the dragon will not hang up on an edge or \"get stuck\".\n\n- 4 scripts. One is for the ondeath of the dragon, is not proven to work. What it was supposed to do is spawn two treasure chests and two \"light beam\" effects upon the death of the dragon. Also, as the dragon fell, it would deal 50 bludgeoning damage to all PCs within range. It should be well-commented enough for even the newest scripter to fix up (if it does not work correctly).\n\nThe other scripts were magic use limitations for PCs - 50% arcane failure. Merely a small point to make the area more challenging for high-level PCs.\n\n- 2 dragon blueprints. A small red dragon (CR 13) and a larger dragon. My plugins crapped out on me for the creature creation, so the abilities for the large dragon may not work properly.\n\n- 2 chest blueprints, resref of the chests to spawn when the dragon dies.\n\nAs far as the dragon's lair itself, it contains mounds of gold (a la Smaug's lair, I've always wondered why no one made a lair like it is supposed to be per fantasy lore), the surface is covered with black melted glass, and other details which either you will hate or love.\n\nAgain, I'd appreciate no ratings based on scripting or creatures, as these are not optimized, I merely left them in so that people could use them should they so wish.\n\nLet me know about the area, and how you enjoy/hate/despise the building.\n\nNote: The time is defaulted (or should) to nightfall, where I've set the environment up to specifications.\n\nThis area was given to a PW (The Frontier), so if you like this area, come see the frontier (especially the high-level zones) for more of my work.\n\nBased on the response, I may upload other areas I've created about 43 in total) based on requests.","Rating":8.08,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"71":{"Name":"Sammoths Keep","Author":"Sammoth666","Submitted":20061203,"Updated":20061207,"Category":"Exterior: Castles","Patch":"1.02","Description":"Big Keep I made but, in the process of adding more placeables etc. Its not final I have a bit more work to do.I planning on adding a bridge or walkpath over the lava on the sides to get to the back cave.This could be a Firegiant Keep also.

In �The Ancient Bloodline� the city is ruled by King Matheus XII (the greedy).\n\nThe city itself is placed upon a mountain that is going upwards towards the sea with only one way to approach it, making it almost impossible to lay siege to the city, with the docks still open.\n\nThe City is divided into six areas� the first is the crossroads at the base of the mountain.\nThe crossroads is where the farms are and a windmill and some of the old Megka ruins of the Hayrodians On the western side of the mountain there is a group of caves called the Mithieen caves . The smaller Mithieen caves are used as mines while the greater cave is a depleted mine and now harbor�s the lair of Vashner, the silver dragon.\n\nThe Second part of the city is the public area. Here you will find gardens and an arena where people from the realm can come and watch spectacular fights. At the second gates stands a barrack that also functions as a storage house and checkpoint for anyone who wants to get in the city. The public area is the lowest part of the city and for that reason is very vulnerable to arrows if an enemy would attack through this part of the city. These two area�s are the only ones that are accessible to none city inhabitants.\n\nThe Third part of the City is the lower district. Here live the common people and poor people, there is a small temple of Brorneo and Isa and a small market place. You will also find some shops here like Sealhar�s Blacksmith and Drak�s Tavern...\n\nWhen you enter the Lower district for the first time you will see a bridge on your right hand side and that�s where the fourth area is .\n\nThe fourth area is the training ground, it is a small mountain connected with a bridge to the main city mountain. Here you will find barracks and trainers who can teach you skill�s and let you train them. The place is famous for its extravagant tower of strength, where mages study the power of enhancing physical strength through magic and religion.\n\nThe Fifth area is on the left hand side , this is the Higher district. When you get through the reinforced gates you will see a field or grain with a statue of Isa and a stone tree of Weberkar in a square with marble stones. The field and tree are holy places where people pray to those god�s and on the edge of the mountain stands a temple of Broreo.\n\nThe Square is surrounded with luxurious houses and at the end of the square at the top of the mountain stands the castle.\n\nThe Sixth is the Harbor district; this part of the city has direct access to the castle.\nIf you are in the high district of the city you are able to access the docks by a path that runs down the mountain on the opposite side of the crossroads and public area. Here you will find a sailors bar where captains and their crew rest and sleep and also bargain about their cargo and trade. Some of the lower district female inhabitants have a working permit there but it has nothing to do with sailing or trading but more with the sailors themselves..\n\n\n\nAttack/defend options\n\nAlthough the city is heavily defended from the front the back is very vulnerable because of the docks. The only two things that defend the docks is the dragon lair Mithieen cave opening on the sea side, and the plateau behind the lower districts temple.\n\nIf you encounter an attack from the front catapults and the trebuchet fire on the crossroads and the bridge to the training ground provides a great spot to pepper the enemy with arrows. If they manage to get in the public area spearmen and swordsmen can hold the enemy back on the steep hill going to the lower district, while bowmen can shoot from the higher district towers and walls making it almost impossible to get through, even getting to the hill would be a death trap.\n\nIf they manage t break through to the lower district the towers and reinforced gate provides the best defense, the enemy would have to get a battering-ram up the hill in the public area while under constant fire.\n\n\n\nHistory:\nIn the beginning of the Third era the Katran people where attacked by the Hayrodian people of Megka who�s reason for this war is still unknown. After the Hayrodians turned Homkatran into a pile of rubble the Katran people and survivor�s retreated to a small village still left untouched in the woods under the protection of the Ferlinain, the village was Folldeck.\n\nFrom there they assembled their last army in the hopes they could attack the centre of Hayrodian power, the city of Megka .\n\nAfter the long march General Matheus saw a small temple with priests at the base of the city. After sending spies to investigate, it appeared they where bringing a statue in resembling one of the Katran. Matheus thought it was a way of putting a spell on the Katran and he and a few soldiers stormed the temple and killed the monks inside who never knew what hit them .\n\nHe ordered his finest soldiers to put on the cloaks and enter the city when the others finished building their ladders.\nThe next day he send the decoy monks in the city with the troops with ladders following them in order to fool the Hayrodians. When they opened the gates for the monks to get in the city the others dropped their ladders, when the monks threw off their cloaks when they were in the city they killed the gate keepers and the rest of the troops poured into the city killing everything and everyone in their path. The Hayrodians where taken completely by surprise and where not wearing their almost impenetrable armor during battle making them easy pray for the Katran�s army.\n\nAfter the Katran victory over the Hayrodians they destroyed every trace of this race from the city apart from the temple which is still today a memorial of this victory and how the Katran trick delivered them the most stunning victory the world had ever seen against all odds.\n\nWhen they rebuilt the city they took great care in making an almost impenetrable city as it is today\nThey called it City of Hayr because they feel the city is the center of the known world.

Not many doors are in but besides that, the building process of this area is complete. Feel free to add any NPC's or edit the area, all I ask is a little credit for the area. :)\n\n There's a lot to see in this area. From the starting gate you move down a coble road to a small farm. This would be one farm of many outside of this area, along the outskirts. The owner just happen to be lucky (or rich) enough to get a spot close to town. Down the road a bit more from the farm is the inn. Following the bend of the road next to the inn, you enter the city. Right away you'll find the small park to the right, up the stairs (my personal favorite spot in the area :D). Next to the park is a church-style building with the first main dock. Then there's the main street of the city. There's a nice fountain upon a few raised curbs, but more importantly, there's the merchants. They're to the left of the street, homes and living courters on the right. At the end of the street, you can see a small storage area with a lonely bench. Then finishes the area with the second main dock.\n\n This area took me a few days and I'm content with it. There's a lot of small details I wish I could have gotten into the screen shots, but I think you'll just have to walk around in it personally and keep an eye out for anything small. I've been trying out a lot of player-made mods and found that a lot of the areas are kinda.. iffy. I mainly build to try to make the game \"pretty\". I love putting way too much detail into things people will probably never notice. Like the light house on the lonely island that's out of range for most people to see with their distance settings. o.o;\n\n Please let me know of any mistakes or problems. I made most of this area while talking with my boyfriend over an IM, so there maybe a few. :D\n\n PS: If anyone cares much, I'll be updating and adding the same area, but filled with a lot more lore.

This is the city that the Paizo Publishing campaign of Shackled City takes place. \nSo far I have completed a walkable section of the North area of the city. The other areas are to follow while I'm soliciting feedback on this one to see what I can take and apply to building of the other areas.\n\nFeel free to download this area and use it if you want to populate it for your own needs. As is customary, I would at least appreciate being credited for it though. I have one favor, if/when anyone uses this area (and the upcoming adjacent areas) and adds quests, etc to it, I would love to see what you've done with it. I intend to make interiors and NPCs (especially the important ones to the campaign), and would love to see or collaborate with others on what can and has been added.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Cauldron: The city is built in a circle. It is built within the caldera of a long-dead volcano. Cauldron is placed in tropical mountainous region overlooking vast rain forests. The city is a cosmopolitan place of about 5,000 population, ruled by wealthy nobles. Each street is a concentric ring around the center which is a bright blue lake. The streets closest to the lake and the docks are are where the poorest and destitute people live. As one travels outward, each subsequent concentric street becomes more and more lavish...and more lit (the docks and side streets can get awfully dark and dangerous at night). The nobles and estates dwell on the outer ring - then a wall surrounds the city. As the city is inside a volcano, imagine the city sitting in the shape of a bowl - so each thoroughfare outwards is not only bigger but higher - the nobles literally look down on the rest of the city. When visiting the docks you're literally looking up at the city.\n\nThe city has cobblestone streets made from dark volcanic rock and is built on the reddish earth of the dead volcano.\n\n\n\nI divided the city up into four quadrants - each the shape of a wedge of watermelon. I have only completed the North. Eventually there will be transitions available on each street at each end that will then take you to the adjacent quadrant. Theoretcially you can eventually walk in a circle around the whole city.\n\nCurrently there are no interiors done, no NPCs, scripting, encounters or conversations. The doors are currently unlocked, but dont lead anywhere, so ultimately I am posting this for people to peruse and just walk through it.\n\nThis is only the second area I have ever built; the first one was just a small outdoor field for practice. I am doing this for two reasons: 1) I would like feedback to see if I'm on the right track towards accomplishing something great. 2) I would like to make it great - with the intention of hopefully attracting the attention of persons who can script etc so that I could team up with them and make the city as a backdrop for a number of quests (as I have no scripting knowledge whatsoever but really want to learn and really want to use this city for quests).\n\nThose interested in learning more about the Pen and Paper version of Shackled City - as it pertains to my campaign that I'm running (as my campaign is set in a homebrew world and so my version of Cauldron does have slight differences than the actual released product) can use the following link to my message board that I maintain for my players' use.\n\nLink\n\n\nRobert\n","Rating":9,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"228":{"Name":"Just Add Encounters - Bridges","Author":"SGK73","Submitted":20070913,"Updated":20070921,"Category":"Exterior: Other","Patch":"1.06","Description":"Areas using the RWS Bridge Pack.\nI will add more files here as I make areas for the other bridges in the pack.","Rating":9.42,"Votes":5,"Awards":["Community Contribution Award Nominee 2008"]},"229":{"Name":"Forest-Ecologies","Author":"Elminster_falcon","Submitted":20070921,"Updated":20070921,"Category":"Exterior: Forests","Forum Thread":"Link","Patch":"1.07","Description":"Good you have my following work here: Forest Ecologies.

It represents a part of Chondalwood and in specific the region near a druid grove. Chondalwood was selected because it was the place where Silvanus appeared during the Time of Troubles.\n\n With the help of a friend, some lore was created to facilitate the existance of the druid grove, the Guardian and the Heart of Silvanus. Hopefully, there aren't any major inconsistencies with the general FR lore and the Time of Troubles. Not sure how good this attempt is, but it is what i had in mind when deciding to create such an area.\n\n Regarding performance, i apologise in advance for the heavy use of trees and vegetation, as it may cause problems. It is my belief that environmental shadows should be turned on for this area, as they heavily impact the feeling of the forest (as well as fps unfortunately).\n\n Some parts of the ground may seem a bit jaggy but i doubt they can be improved more, taking into consideration the variety of heights for the area and the absence of mesh refinement abilities from the toolset. \n\n And an issue with the creatures: some of them (such as deers) have been placed outside the occlusion grid (buildable area) on decorative purposes. While they do show up in the toolset, they are not visible ingame. Perhaps it is a nwn2 engine issue, since placeables, npcs and creatures that can battle the player are displayed (ingame). The problem seems to be with creatures with a decorative purpose. \n\n Two versions are availiable, one with haks and one without any haks.

Roughly translated from the Italian, Malebolge means \"evil ditches\". Malebolge is a large, funnel-shaped cavern, itself divided into ten concentric circular trenches or ditches. Each trench is called a bolgia (Italian for \"pouch\" or \"ditch\"). Long causeway bridges run from the outer circumference of Malebolge to its center, pictured as spokes on a wheel. At the center of Malebolge is the ninth and final circle of hell, Cocytus.\n\nIn Dante�s version of hell, categories of sin are punished in different circles, with the depth of the circle (and placement within that circle) symbolic of the amount of punishment to be inflicted. Sinners placed in the upper circles of hell are given relatively minor punishments, while sinners in the depths of hell endure far greater torments. As the eighth of nine circles, Malebolge is one of the worst places in hell to be. In it, sinners guilty of \"ordinary\" fraud are punished. (That is, fraud that is committed without particularly malicious intent. Malicious or \"compound\" fraud � fraud that goes against bond of love, blood or honor � are punished in the ninth circle.) Sinners of this category include counterfeiters, hypocrites, sorcerers and simonists.\n\nDante and his guide, Virgil, make their way into Malebolge by riding on the back of the monster Geryon, the personification of fraud, who flies them down through the yawning chasm that separates the eighth circle from the seventh circle, where the violent are punished. Dante and Virgil plan on crossing Malebolge by way of the system of bridges, but find their path disturbed by many broken ledges and collapsed bridges that were destroyed during the Harrowing of Hell. They must then cross some of the bolgias on foot and even rely on demons to guide them. Eventually they make it to the inner ledge, where the Titan Antaeus lowers them down to Cocytus. -Wikipedia.\n*******************************\nCity of Dis\n*******************************\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"252":{"Name":"Just Add Encounters - Tourney Field","Author":"SGK73","Submitted":20071116,"Updated":20071117,"Category":"Exterior: Other","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Coconutshells not included...","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":["Community Contribution Award Nominee 2008"]},"253":{"Name":"Just Add Encounters - Deepsnow Areas","Author":"SGK73","Submitted":20071121,"Updated":20090707,"Category":"Exterior: Winter","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Winter areas where the walkmesh differs from the terrain mesh, creating the illusion of a deep snowcover.\n\nThe tools for extracting and packing the .trx files can be found here: Link\n\nI have included a script to slow movement in selected areas however I have not drawn any in the area.

Serpent's Hold is the training ground for nearly all the realm of Britannia's knights.\nSerpent's Hold is, mostly... a single, compound structure, with an internal castle to house the Lord and Captains, the instructors, meetings halls, and the mess hall. Outside of that, but still within the keep's walls, are the barracks, the smithy, the stables, and the training grounds. Serpent's Hold is less a city more than it is a great stronghold. Although the keep has been there for some time... very few newer buildings have sprung up around it.\nSerpent's Hold stands, as a building symbolizing the principle of Courage, and it's mighty walls strengthen the courage of it's fighters, and allies, while putting fear into the hearts of the enemies of the keep. The Order of the Silver Serpent has total command over the fortress, and adventurers of every kind are welcome to test their martial skills in a sparring match.\nThe fighters of Serpent's Hold are the best in all of Britannia, and will oft train many recruits in their ways of fighting and war. Also, the very best weapons and armours are produced at Serpent's Hold. Serpent's Hold is also known to house the Eternal Flame of Courage and the Bell of Courage, two items of highly symbolical value. As long as Serpent's Hold stands strong, Britannia will yet defend itself from every kind of threat. This variant of Serpent's Hold is from Ultima Online.\n\nNote: It was necessary to take several liberties in order to create a more realistic and convincing 3D version of UO's Serpent's Hold for Nwn2. I made the terrain more mountainous, and I also emphasised the tropical climate of southern Britannia. I lastly added some unique touches, like fountains, statues, an orchard, etc. to present more diversity as well. What you'll find, is an interesting prefab useful for those working on Ultima projects, or any module that needs a good island castle. Feel free to use as desired and change anything you like. Just do not forget to mention me, if you end up using this in your mod, or world. ;)\n\nContains a module so you can explore Serpent's Hold at your leisure, and an .erf for importing it into your own module.

Add your own stories, use parts of it. It is meant to be for a large multiplayer module. \nHopefully, it will be the start someone needs to create some buzz in the NWN2 world with their module.\n\n\n*Updated high-res photos with desc. at bottom as of now\n\n**More pictures of what I have done can be found here: Link\n\n***Much of that site is outdated and the areas that you download here may be a little more finished - either way it will be a good resource to see exactly what is in these files.\n\nThis was started to be a sequel to the Path of Ascension. As time went on, I realized my ultimate goal would not be achievable by myself. The idea to throw this module up on the vault has been in my head for many months now, and after joining various teams, trying to modify it, etc... I just never found anyone with the work ethic to help to finish it.\n\n This was made to be a level 10-20 hack/slash persistent world. It even Beta tested for quite a while but I couldn't get the scripters I needed for the final result I desired. Also, after having my second child time is not something I have much of anymore. \n\nIn this mod you will find many unique creatures and 37 unique areas (I have added an additional 6 below here). In my opinion they are all very well-done. Transitions have all been placed, many triggers and creatures have been placed, convo scripts, stores, you name it it is here. Hopefully, this is exactly what someone has been looking for. You can modify it how you want, rip it apart, it's all fine with me.(Yes you can even change the name) \n\nAs of now I have the low, medium, rare, unique treasure system in place with a lot of unique items - again this is all set for something that I was trying to balance, but it all can be easily changed. Yes, this module was nearly complete, but I just don't have the time to finish it. After at least 300 hours into this thing I just realized I needed a change.\n\nHere's an additional challenge for people. If you modify it and make it work, and want to make this into a top-notch multiplayer module, I will join your team to help finish it. \nI think Ideally I would move the levels back to 3-20 and start from there. Creatures would have to be rebalanced, but there is a lot to build on.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have been able to use my work. I'd love to see feedback on it all. \n\nPS Not every area there has pictures to the right, but I've covered most of the bases and you can find every area at the link above. \n\n\n***Updated to include map overlay of the 37 areas in the EW_POHA_BETA file\n","Rating":9.54,"Votes":27,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"291":{"Name":"New Orc City","Author":"Roland","Submitted":20080224,"Updated":20080225,"Category":"Exterior: Castles","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"This is an area that contains a castle keep that will be held by an Orc Tribe in one of my modules.

Toolset isn't very friendly with rather large areas, but the game plays just fine. \n\n-----------\n\nThis area is modeled after the information given by the Unapproachable East handbook, combined with a few extra touches from myself. The Surague Escarpment is one of many areas that you�ll be able to visit in Thayvian Nights: a module I have been working on for the past few months. The area takes into consideration that Thay is a relatively dry land, so the western border is relatively bare of grass and trees.\n\nA few things that I�ve added was the natural hot springs that form along the base of the Surague, where a dormant volcano has remained relatively inactive over the past few years. This concept was borrowed from the Yellowstone National Park and Old Faithful. \n\nThe screenshots to your right only feature a few sample spots of interests, but there are plenty more to be had in this area. The area is fairly large, so it would be impossible to capture every scene of interest.\n\n----------------------------------------- \nSurague Escarpment \n----------------------------------------- \n\nAt the eastern edge of Thay, amid the foothills of the Sunrise Mountains, rises the third of Thay�s major cliffs - the Surague Escarpment. The Surague forms a shelf atop the First Escarpment, averaging about 6,000ft (183m) in elevation. Numerous streams spill down from the heights of the Sunrise Mountains, creating a tangled maze of gorges and canyonlands in this corner of the country. (Unapproachable East, p150).\n\nThe Sunrise Mountains, which many consider to mark the eastern end of Faerun, run all the way from the center of Rashemen to just past the south-eastern border of Thay. It forms the entirety of Thay's eastern border, towering just below 15,000ft above sea level. The mountains are teeming with dangerous animals and hostile humanoids. From time to time, scouts from the goblin and kobold tribes living here forage into Thay.\n\nEvery now again, the tharchions of Thay send an expedition into the peaks of the mountains for those sturdy and adventurous enough to take on the task. The Sunrise Mountains are said to be virtually impassable on foot, but those who know their way about the mountain can scale the cliffsides or find another path that other inhabitants of the mountains have made. Old Raumviran towers and strongholds lie buried beneath the snow of the high slopes, as well as ancient well-like fortresses of some even older people forgotten by time. Rumors have it of a hidden passage leading through the mountains into the Endless Wastes beyond, but no such cavern has been found to this date. The caverns beneath the Sunrise Mountains are filled with horrible creatures, including nagas, chimeras, and things unspeakably worse.\n\n----------------------------------------- \nArea Statistics \n-----------------------------------------\nORL = Over-Recommended Limit\nArea Size: 24x32\nAmount of space useable: Roughly 50-60% without further modifications.\nTime Taken to Complete Area: 7 days\nArea Entrance�s/Exits: A path leading to the Rauthammar Plateau at the south-west corner; 3 cavern entrances towards the eastern side; a farmhouse to the north; and a path leading to the Sunrise Mountains area (not included) towards the central east region.\nLayout Design: Linear (one exterior entrance and exit each). \nTrees Used: AspenC, Boxwood, Frond Shrub C, London Plane, Spruce, Umbrella Thorn (6 - +1 ORL).\nSeeds: 176718, 874459, 497721, 481259, 486299 (5 - +1 ORL)\nTextures: \nDirt_13 (main dirt � base texture), \nRocky_05 (main pathway), \nCliff_08 (For rocky cliffsides), \nGrass_14 (main grass texture), \nDirt_15 (muddier texture � compliment to Dirt_13), \nMud_01 (used as the base for the waterfalls and to give the mountain a dirtier look), \nSnow_01 (Escarpment peaks), \nSnow_03 (Texture blender for the snow � also used to make the textures appear greyer from the cold)\n\nPS: Escarpment is a precipitous cliff.","Rating":9.8,"Votes":12,"Awards":[]},"312":{"Name":"Forgotten Ziggurat","Author":"Wyrin","Submitted":20080322,"Updated":20080322,"Category":"Obsidian Area Contest","Forum Thread":"Link","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"This is an area I've had in mind for a long time, but isn't going to be needed until chapter 4 of my current series Dark Avenger, but I thought it was a nice idea to throw into the contest and make available to others.\n\nThe forgotten Ziggurat once stood in a lush jungle, that over the years has given way to swamp.

Climbing the ridge to the plateau in the centre of a highlands gives a vista of a grassland marked with rocky outcroppings. The West is dominated by a mountain peak with a failing mine, which overlooks the potential dangers lurking in a set of ruins in the valley. Heading to the East, a dirt track descends into a gully, which passes through to a lush forested area. Here a mountain stream cascades into a cool lake surrounding a sacred grove. To the north lies an eerie moor, which during the day seems benign, but at night takes upon a more sinister aura.

I have reduced the entering characters to .3 scale .. the current, crude-but-functional script changes the scale and slows down the character to keep the movement speed relative to the PC's size.\n\nThanks to this scaling, I have been able to deliver you a complete island to explore. An area that takes a long time to walk from one end to the other. An area big enough to get lost in.\n\nThis scaling does have a couple of effects that may initially be unsettling.\n\nThe camera settings are designed for normal sized (1,1,1) characters.. thus, when zooming in the camera goes over your scaled-down avatar. When using the NWN1-style strategy mode it is best to keep the zoom a bit back from your character. It also works fairly well to use the Chase Camera and lower the view to watch your PC run.\n\nThere is a script to slow you down in the swamp. It has a SpellID of 1001.. and the scaled-speed has an ID# of 1000.. I have no idea if these conflict with anything.. not my forte.. and in interest of completing this for the NWN2 Area Contest I haven't researched this. If any issues arrise from this I will update!\n\nThe Area is based on the descriptions in Robert Louis Stevenson's book, \"Treasure Island.\" He was inspired by the area around Monterey California and thus mentions an island with a good deal of pine trees. However, he also sets Treasure Island at a location that is fiting of palm trees and tropical plants.\n\nWhile such areas exist, I found that many I talked with thought the two tree-types didn't coexist. I assure those critical of this mix to research what troubles them.\n\nIn addition to recreating Treasure Island as described in the book, I also wanted to use only what was given to me in the NWN2 toolset. I built this with NWN2 1.11 .. This left me a bit lacking in shrubbery. (Oh how the kights who say, \"Nih!\" would be disappointed!) .. I rotated and scaled the two tropical shrubs I found in the toolset (Shrub-small.. Shrub-medium) to create my clumps of greenery.\n\nThere may be other shrubs that would work. I had already used the Holly bushes in the swamp and thought the same plant up in the hills would be inappropriate. There may also be other placeables that I missed.

It was here that arcane and divine magic were at their pinnacle.

Requires minor tweaking before it is functional.\n\nThis is my second attempt at building an area using the NWN2 toolset. My aim was to create a small settlement, to the purpose of learning the processes of terraforming, texturing surfaces, and working with the placeables. \n\nMy approach to areabuilding is that an area should be an expression of something bigger. Similar to how a construction site tells of engineering, and how a modern office building tells of capitalism, each area in gamedesign should tell of something. \n\nFor the setting, I decided to focus on the concept of a medieval knight's residence. In the feudal age, knights were vassals of more powerful landlords. The knight would serve the landlord in war and administration and in exchange, the knight received an amount of land and serfs to live from. He would need to keep horses, provide armour and weaponry as well as surround himself with a number of warriors to protect his belongings. \n\nI began the area with the idea of a large mansion. I took inspiration from the Briton hillforts of the classical era. I placed the mansion on an artificial hill, and surrounded it with a number of apple trees to hint at luxury. I fenced the hill and began to work on the homes of the knight's servants. He would only keep his most trusted and important servants close to him, such as his warriors and horsehandlers. Placing housing for 6 families, I worked on a path and again fenced it off. Next I kept a stroke of lands free as pasture for the knight's horses. A hillfort wouldn't be a hillfort without fortification, and I painstakingly constructed a palisade and ditch. I realised the pasture would also make an excellent military camp in times of trouble, and thus I added an encampment next. The watchtowers came after that, and I figured it would be nice to have something to actually look-out at. I placed some trees and elevation and by applying an old theatre trick, crafted the optical illusion of distance by scaling the trees smaller the more distant they were. \n\nThe area is not yet finished and not suitable for actual play. It has no sounds, no NPC's and no gameplay content. It is simply my second attempt at worldbuilding using the NWN2 toolset.\n\nSome of the lessons I learned:\n- Applying different shades of the same texture might look good in the toolset, but it does not come out properly in-game. \n- Settle the area dimensions early in the creation process. Having to change it later will create allot of work since the elevations have to be adjusted. This is difficult and I haven't been able to make the landscape look good after making an area bigger.\n- NWN2 is not made for looking into the distance, but rather top-down in the style of Baldur's Gate. I have to take this into account what making my compositions of placables, building, etc.. \n- The proportions of the placeables are scaled too small and are almost fairytale-like. Interior-design won't match the exterior proportions of the houses. This makes my drive for authenticity difficult, and will require creative solutions and tedious efforts to get it right. For this module, I used BTH's housing pack and 'clipped' the houses into each other to make bigger houses. \n\nSome of my design principles, mostly explained with some example questions I come up with while building:\n- Authenticity, not sensationalism. Areas should be believable at first, beautiful at second. \n- Region and geography determines terrain. All non-human(oid) elements from 'nature's perspective'. IE: what natural processes have affected the area and terrain?\n- Function and purpose determines engineering. All human(oid)-elements such as constructions and roads are there as effect or side-effect from human(oid) activity. IE: What was this activity? What was the purpose? Why is a home placed the way it is? Why was it build in that style of architecture? What has happened to the building since it was made?\n- Enhance the gameplay experience. Players will witness the area as they travel through it to quest, battle, etc. An area should accommodate player movement and activities. IE: between which points will players travel most? Should this be clustered as much as possible?\n- The landscape is a gamefeature. Exploration and sightseeing shpud be accomodated.\n- The context of the gameplay narrative. The area should hint at the storyline and plot the players are going through. IE: if there is a war, should there be signs of siege or preparation? \n- The day of play. There should be signs of daily activity, according to the time and period a players travels the area. IE: if it's winter on a farm, are all farming implements stored away? \n- Computer performance. The complexity of the area should not be a hindrance to the player. (Note that with this area, I disregarded performance.)\n\nI might continue with the area in the future. At the moment, I just wanted to share it so that I can 'proof' myself to any people or projects looking for builders. \n\nIf anyone can actually make use of this area, feel free to do so. And please let me know how it works out for you!\n\n\nNote: I combined the following resources into the module's hakpak (part of the .rar files):\n\nBTH House Placeables\nRWS Bridge Pack\n BTH Rural Defence Pack\n\nA big thanks goes to their creators!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"366":{"Name":"Forest Labyrinth","Author":"Fhulhi","Submitted":20080701,"Updated":20080701,"Category":"Exterior: Other","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"You find yourself walking through a forest shrouded with dense fog.

The keep has an inner courtyard, a fully walkable roof, and another small, middle level that would be good for something like a shrine. Please note that there are no interior areas created for the keep at this time. Instead, the three doors in the courtyard are currently linked to the upper levels of the keep so that you can walk around on the roof. I have also included a custom load screen for this area. There are some locations on the roof where the walkmesh is a bit quirky, but it's the best that I could get after many attempts.\n\nThe area around the keep consists of grassy plains, lightly forested areas, a deeply forested area, a coastal beach area, and a couple of streams that lead into the sea. There is also a vineyard behind the abbey, although only a portion of it is inside the walkable terrain. There are several walking paths that were implemented in such a way to provide convenient transition points from different kinds of terrain. I went a bit light on the placeables associated with the keep, figuring that they would be pretty specific to each person�s own intentions. I have intentionally dismissed the idea of cutting out individual trees from the walkable terrain because this can be irksome to those who play with tree fading enabled.\n\nFeel free to inform me of any serious gaffes in the area (trees floating off the ground, places where the camera swings inside the keep, etc.) and I�ll do my best to make them right. With an area of this size and scope, there are bound to be some spots that can be touched up and improved upon, but hopefully the majority of the terrain is usable as it is.\n\nAcknowledgment when using this prefab is much appreciated!\n\nInstallation and Use:\n=====================\nThis area has the following dependencies:\n\nBCKII Generic hak - Link\nBCKII Gothic hak - Link\n\nI have packaged this area into three parts: 1) A module demo 2) A hak file 3) An ERF file. The module and the ERF are compressed using the freely available 7zip archiver.\n\nDemo Module: A fully baked version of the area with the custom loadscreen and a little scripting to turn outside lights on and off at appropriate times.\n\nHAK pak: This contains the 2da changes and MDB files used by the community content as well as my own custom loadscreen and placed effects.\n\nERF file: This contains the exported ERF file for the area.\n\nTo try the demo:\n1. Download the module and place it in your ../My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/modules directory.\n2. Download the hak dependencies noted above as well as the empathyabbey.hak file down below and place it in your ../My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/hak directory.\n3. Start a new game -> new module and select \"Empath Abbey\". Any character will do, there are no encounters.\n\nFor builders:\nI don�t need to tell you, you know the drill. You can either download the HAK and associate it with your module and import the ERF file if you don�t already have your own 2da changes, or you can merge my changes in with yours. I tried to be sensible in my 2da assignments. Hopefully they don�t collide too badly with yours.\n\nAcknowledgments:\n================\nNytir�s BCKII is a brilliant piece of work that made this possible. If you enjoy this area, be sure to go and give him a big ole, high vote. He did such a great job with it.\n\nSGK�s collision helpers for their indispensable value in preventing the camera from swinging inside the keep and completely killing immersion. Without the collision helpers, you would experience some really ugly moments with the camera passing through the walls of the keep, so please remember SGK with a nice vote if you make use of this area.

The maps are roughly half rolling area with 1-4 eroded and terraced hills. Nearly all the walkmeshs require little to no touching up. The area transitions work but need attention. The areas are not designed to fit together but are connected for convenience.\n\nYATT imports your L3DT Height and Alpha maps into the toolset. The YATT website explains what pixel sizes your L3DT maps must be in order for YATT to succeed. You will have to resize your L3DT maps accordingly either on export from L3DT or in an image viewer/editor such as Irfanview(it's free last I checked).\n\nWhen you resize your map, you will also have to translate the max and min altitude of the L3DT height map if you have not already accounted for this in L3DT via the horizontal scale in the Design Map dialog.\n\nOtherwise, your map will be stretched or squashed when you import it into the toolset. It is possible you may like this effect.\n\nYou can find the max altitude in L3DT by right clicking and choosing Operations->Heightfield-->Change vert. scale. Note, I messed up and set the wrong min height on all these maps. The result is that for each map, half of it is below sea level.\n\nThe smaller the L3DT tile count, the faster L3DT operates, but the smaller the resolution. I find that this is not a problem as cluttered terrain is a pain to maneuver through, and with the right settings, L3DT will crumple and roll the terrain so the eye is not bored, and leave the terrain usable.\n\nThe Design Map is the first map that L3DT makes. It is a grid and rough layout for the whole project. You can control a number of parameters in each grid. You can place mountains, plateaus, and seas. Change climate, erosion, terracing, lake formation, peaks, ridges, rolling, height on a grid by grid basis by clicking on each grid or brushing them on. You can also make changes on the entire map as a whole.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have tweaked the Design Map before I released my maps. I could have placed some mountains, plateaus, or seas to highlight the no-walk areas better.\n\n","Rating":9.54,"Votes":27,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"407":{"Name":"NWN2 OC and MotB Lighting Presets","Author":"Jaesun999","Submitted":20081013,"Updated":20081014,"Category":"Day-Night cycles","Forum Thread":"Link","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"NWN2 OC and MotB Lighting Presets\n\nThis collection of lighting presets are the exported Environmental Settings from 140 areas in the Original Campaign and Mask of the Betrayer areas.

Throughout the years it has been an independant hold, overrun and occupied by Orcish hordes, and, briefly, served as the seat of government for Gondegal the Usurper King. \n\nArabel today is a booming, prosperous center of growth. Both newcomers and young Cormyreans are settling in the lands all around it, making Arabel, as the only practical place where they can hire services, ever richer and busier. It's a city of opportunity that is still lacking many of the sophistications of Suzail but not consumers' appetites for them. \n\nOften referred to as the Caravan City or Overland City of Cormyr, Arabel is dominated by land transport. It is a city of trading costers, warehouses, caravan companies, wagon makers, horse- and bullock-traders and merchant investors. All these are ably governed by ex-adventuress Myrmeen Lhal, the king's lord of Arabel.\n\n\nThis is my take on Arabel, using the maps provided in the Shadowdale supplement, but it can be used as a generic city in any context. I wanted to have a city which could be explored in one area, rather than separae areas for each of the districts. As such it's large, but can be cropped down using TerraCoppa as required.\n\nAmbient placeables (barrels, crates etc) have been left out for now so this can be used for whatever purpose.\n\nI've added some small areas to accompany the city\nKabarr's crystals - a store selling magical crystals and gems\nThe Pride of Arabel (unfinished) - the basis for a high class inn\nCitadel - the Purple Dragon's base in the city, including rooftops access with views over the city","Rating":9.58,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"430":{"Name":"Candelkeep","Author":"Sebastien_Raymond","Submitted":20081229,"Updated":20090422,"Category":"Exterior: Castles","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Here it his: Candelkeep. \n\nAll exterior areas have been reproduced, as well as all the shops, temples and all places of interest like the library itself, like in the 1997 release. \n\nI respected as closely as possible the original design release by Bioware in 1997 and I even observed the precise location of objects in indoors areas.

Lower level has an open tunnel end to continue downwards using the caves or\nRWS Deep Chasms tilsets. No creatures are placed. There is a transition from level 0 to level 1 in place, and a\ncute \"scrap of paper\" note at the beginning to give a rough bearing on finding it. I designed this to be played in \"character\" camera mode. Play it and you'll see why :)\n\nBuilders Notes: \n\nExcept for periodic \"clutter\" in the hallway systems, I only \"defined\" 2 real areas on level 0 to allow you to\ntailor it to your design; the first is what I made to be a humanoid type lair area (I'm thinking Kobolds), and\nthe other an obvious spider lair.\n\nI have a light setting set to make this map set very dark, requiring use of light spells or a torch- there's a\ntorch placed at the entrance for testing purposes. The whole ambience of the place is designed around low light settings. I'm including a copy of the importable light settings I used for your inspection/use.\n\nAlso, given that I used RWS \"Deep Sewers\" tilset, I noted that using camera modes other than \"character\" allowed\nthe tops of moss and cobweb placeables to be seen when zooming out- to combat this I have placed a \"tileblock\" on\nlevel 0 (see screenshot) to show you how to further place additional tiles similar to this to complete the setup.\nI left the rest out because once they are in place, you cant see the corridors in the toolset either :) Setting\nup in this fashion also has an additional benefit- the player map and mini map are hidden from the player,\nrequiring a more cautious approach to exploration. Personally, I hate the map being shown to the player, hence\nall this.\n\nNOTE: You can remove these \"tileblock\" tiles via the toolset if you wish, I just wanted to show a system where you\ncan have more control over the environment. \n\nInstallation: Unpack the archive.\n\nsewers001.mod goes in your Neverwinternights 2\\modules folder.\nBlackDayNightStage.DayNightStage is an environment setting you can import into other mods.\nx_normal_vision.sef is an override you can use to disable low light vision for humans.

Its unholy taint is said to invade the dream scape of any who make camp to close to the blighted glade in which it resides. Tales have tantalized my mind with images of fiendish lizardfolk and ravenous Yuan-ti. Even rumors of demonic cults have cropped up in the gossip circles of the bordering swamp towns. Perhaps most outlandish of all is one farmers claim of a great shadow that swept across his field toward that forbidden demesne. Some speculated it was a dragon while others contrived more unbelievable and horrible ideas than that - hellish fiends or a rampant flying abomination born of mad wizardry to name but two.\n\nI myself made way towards the infamous caverns to uncover the truth of the mystery surrounding them. Neither adventure, nor the unholy are new to me. I have examined the ground where necromantic abominations have marched and fought bandits for life and goods; however, none of my experience had prepared me for the true vileness of the eldritch aura that permeated the humid air of that place. I must confess my fear far outweighed my curiosity and the alien howls and hisses and inhuman screams that came at night did little to encourage my naturally inquisitive mind. So I left that place, and I am better off for it I believe.

The prison itself - a towering keep of stone - stands above all other structures in the town. It dwarfs even the towering apartments that make up the bulk of the settlement. I crossed over the pristine waters of the river called Twin Lash and rounded past the cemetery on my way to my new home: The Sanctuary of Sacred Strife. As I hopped down from the wagon I gave myself a moment to take in the beauty of the temple before me. Four great domed spires topped with thick iron spikes crowned the stone structure and two statues stood on either side of the door as if they had been waiting for me. Each was a depiction of the Maiden of Pain and it felt as though their open and outstretched hands were an invitation for my entrance. \n\nI must admit a measure of uncertainty as well. I came here because the church I came from was liberal in its dealings of pain...too liberal for my philosophies. I hear tell that the Sanctuary of Sacred Strife has a more conservative view on Loviatar's dogma. I find myself hoping this was truth as I entered the ground level. The first floor was lavish compared to the small church I have traveled from. With marble floors, golden trim, and statues each depicting the three pains of Loviatar it was an impressive sight. \n\nA Painbringer - garbed in an iron spiked ceremonial breastplate - greeted me. I followed my sister to the room she called The Antechmaber and there I met Dagna the Truescar, leader of this temple - the largest temple to Loviatar on the north coast I am told. The Antechamber was lit only by candle light and I caught the quivering crying form of a half naked man chained to a table behind Mistress Dagna out the corner of my eye. His blessings of pain where not my business however and I did my best to keep my attention upon Lady Dagna as she welcomed me. As we left my eyes lingered on the expertly sculpted statues of bronze that were pressed against the stone walls of The Antechamber. For a moment I could have sworn there were small faces of agony worked into the surface of the statues, but perhaps the dim lighting was but playing tricks on my eyes.\n\nAfter the magnificent display of the ground level and the ornate statues of the dimly lit Antechamber I expected something even grander of the living quarters that resided on the top floor. As I was shown to my bed, however, I noted the rather plain nature of it all. Bare walls, a few rugs and candles were the only adornments. My bedroom I learned I would share with thirteen other sisters. The size of this place still impresses me. There is not much privacy save for the single trunk and bed that are my own, but I do not mind. I have no pains or anything else for that matter that I will hide from my sisters.

That is, you can see one area from another area.\n\nThe 11 areas are:\nFort Moultrie (FM): A fort built on the beach.\nLazaretto Marsh (LZ): A salt marsh with small islands and linked to an abandoned monastery turned goblin fort.\nWassau (WS): A city, complete with docks, drydock, town square, cathedral, and back alleys.\nRanzhuang (RZ): A small village for little people (gnomes and halflings), set amongst rice paddies.\nHarper's Ferry (HF): An improvised fort built upon a sand bar, complete with a pontoon bridge spanning the river.\nBayou Alesienne (BA): A cypress swamp\nOssabaw Woods (OS): a stretch of forest overlooking the path along the river.\nBeaufort (BF): A town overlooking the river.\nCape Jessamine (CJ): A plantation-style large farm.\nGwalior Hills (GH): A stretch of open, grassy hills.\nGwalior Rock (GR): An outcropping amongst the hills, topped with a menhir and attended by a nomadic encampment.\n\nThe areas are fairly bare, I've added basic sounds, but you will probably need to add in more placeables to customize each area to your particular tastes and needs. \n\nThese are ERF files, you will need to add them to your module by using the import function, under 'File' in the toolset.\n\nUpdates:\n12 September 2009 - Minor changes to Harper's Ferry, plus two new pics.\n\n20 February 2010 - Three new areas added, filling in the 'hole' in the center of the map:\n\nThe West Bank (WB) - Swampy wilderness area south of Cape Jessamine (CJ).\nChickamauga Gorge (CG) - 12x12 area sandwiched between Gwalior Rock (GR) and Harper's Ferry (HF). Filled with narrow defiles with thick cover, perfect for ambuscades.\nOcmulgee Caverns (OC) - A massive network of caverns deep below the Gwalior Hills (GH), complete with ancient ruins and modern shanties.\n\nSlight modifications have been made to all other areas as well. In addition to area transitions to the new areas, I've added lights to GR, CJ, BF, RZ, WS, and FM. I've also left terrain triggers in place in GR, GH, CJ, OS, RZ, OG, WB, LZ, and FM.\n\nAdditionally, now OC, BA, and OS now use scripted lights that add extra sun/moon lighting in spots.

It grows every year from the goods it exports namely the valuable ore and marble from its quarry and mines to the west. Small farms have begun to crop up around the town as its wealth reaches new heights with every year that passes. To the south past the farmlands are forests and to the east across the expanse of the river thicker woods still.\n\n****************************************\n\nI built this town sometime ago and wanted to expand upon it with some of the areas mentioned in the description, but I never found the time.

I built these over the course of a day. Most of the work has gone into the exterior area (32x32) and the interior areas (a cave which travels behind the waterfall and an interior to link two levels of the village) are relatively undeveloped - due to a crash I lost three of the area transitions and the entire village interior, but it is relatively simple to work out what should link to where. \n\nI was going to rebuild the interior which links the levels of the village but as I had already decided not to use this area in my campaign I thought it would be better to allows builders to develop the interior as they wish, so you will simply find an empty grid to connect the levels of the village. Alternatively you could forgo the interior and link the doors directly, depending on the level of realism you would like.\n\nThe exterior contains a small village with elven architecture, or as close as I could get. It has three cave entrances; two of which are for the waterfall passage and the last of which could be used as an exit from the valley or a dungeon entrance. There are various bridges to traverse and as far as I am aware the walkmeshes work as intended, but I have not done extensive testing. \n\nIt may look tree-heavy, but I have kept the numbers of trees to a minimum.

All are categorized by challenge rating and run from CR 1 to CR 22. The book also includes advice for DMs on constructing similar traps to the ones presented, including tutorials on basic logic puzzles.\n[edit]Description of sample traps\nAll of the Treasure, None of the Traps A series of already-sprung traps in a spiral corridor that automatically reactivate once the players reach the center.\nFire and Water A logic puzzle that connects the pulling of colored levers with musical tones to prevent the players from accidentally unleashing either lava or rushing water.\nCurse of Iron A magically-locked door that bears a riddle, the solution to which is the only sure means of entry.\nMedusa's Traveling Casino Not a trap per se, but a series of gambling games meant to part the PCs and their gold. (the segment is rated at CR 12, only as the potential combat NPCs equal that.)\n[edit]Publication history\n\nThe book was published as a paperback, perfect-bound edition by Wizards of the Coast in June 2002. It was authored by Daniel Kaufman, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Mike Selinker, and Skip Williams. Cover art was by Todd Lockwood, with interior art by David Day and Wayne Reynolds.\"\n\nAs an aid to the NWN2 community, and for general practice with programming, I have decided to start going through and re-creating these encounters for NWN2. All will be found here, as file uploads (a zip file containing whatever files are needed, more often than not in *.erf format). \n\nIf there is a certain one you want to see done, let me know in the comments.\n\n\nSo far:\n-A Familiar Situation (ECL 1)\n [Mostly dialog/placeable use to get a bunch of familiars back in their baskets]\n-Temple of Draxion (ECL 2)\n [Weak monsters well defended, a lot of fun placeable effects here, was testing out various code ideas. worth a look just for the scripts]\n-Curse of Iron (ECL 4)\n [A favorite of mine, and my first use of xml code...ever.]\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"631":{"Name":"Arena_001_24x24","Author":"Ugly_Duck","Submitted":20120816,"Updated":20120816,"Category":"Exterior: City","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Arena_001_24x24\n\n************************************\n*** Area Prefab: Arena_001_24x24 ***\n************************************\nDate: August 16th, 2012 (08-16-2012)\n\nMy latest area; a town with a large arena in the center.\n\nUse this however you see fit, but do give credit.\n\n\nTo check out the .erf file, simply start the toolset, import the Arena_001_24x24.erf file, place a start location, save it as whatever you want to call it.
