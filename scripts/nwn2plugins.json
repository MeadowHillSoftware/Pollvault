These are \n usually bound to a skeleton and this structure holds the weights\n as well as the vertices for a mesh. The mapping between the skeleton and\n the vertex bone index is unknown so it is currently being guessed.\n \n The Skeleton name is currently saved in User Defined sheet on the mesh.\n This name is required for exporting new meshes.\n \n Collision2 (COL2):\n These seem to be less detailed collision meshes. And do not tightly\n conform to the model. We dont really know the difference between COL2\n and COL3 at this time.\n Append _C2 to name to export meshes as COL2 collision meshes.\n \n Collision3 (COL3):\n These seem to be more detailed collision and conform more closely to \n the model. We dont really know the difference between COL2 and COL3\n at this time.\n Append _C3 to name to export meshes as COL3 collision meshes.\n \n Collision Spheres (COLS):\n These are the collision radii around specific bones in the skeleton.\n Prefix name with \"COLS??\" to add this sphere to the collision sphere.\n \n Walkmeshes (WALK):\n Walk meshes seem to control where you can walk and where you cannot.\n Some vertices have unusual values like -1,000,000 to indicate\n a link to other walk meshes or perhaps non-navigable terrain.\n In Max, you probably want to use Quad/Tri Patches to create these.\n \n Material IDS (Source: Jason Keeney of Obisidan)\n \n MTL DEC HEX Name \n ---- ---- ----- --------\n 1 0 0x0000 no walk \n 2 9 0x0009 dirt \n 3 17 0x0011 grass \n 4 33 0x0021 stone \n 5 65 0x0041 wood \n 6 129 0x0081 carpet \n 7 257 0x0101 metal \n 8 513 0x0201 swamp \n 9 1025 0x0401 mud \n 10 2049 0x0801 leaves \n 11 4097 0x1001 water\n 12 8193 0x2001 puddles \n \n\n I have remapped the material ids since max does not support values greater\n than 1000. For backward compatibility, if the name starts with \"0x\" then\n the old mechanism is used else I just use the values above.\n \n Append _W to name to export a meshes as a WALK mesh.\n \n Hook Points (HOOK):\n Hook points are used to attach doors and accessories to a RIGD mesh.\n Prefix name with \"hp_\" to export a hook point.\n \n Hair Points (HAIR):\n Hair points contain certain flags regarding behavior of the hair.\n Prefix name with \"*?_Hair\" where ? is F for female hair and M for male.\n\n You can set the HairFlag property on Node User Defined sheet. Set the value\n HairFlag=# where # is a number from 0 to 2.\n \n Hair Shortening flags are: Low(0), Short(1), Ponytail(2), None(3).\n \n Helm Points (HELM):\n Helm points contain certain flags regarding behavior of the helmets and hair.\n Prefix name with \"*_Helm\" to make a point a Helm Point.\n\n You can set the HairFlag property on Node User Defined sheet. Set the value\n HelmFlag=# where # is a number from 0 to 3.\n \n Helm Hiding flags are: None_Hidden(0), Hair_Hidden(1), Partial_Hair(2),\n Head_Hidden(3) and Head_Hidden_with_Beard(4).\n \n Terrain (TRRN):\n Terrain are used in conjunction with TRN files that are created by the \n Toolset editor. It holds the layout of the module areas.\n \n Bones (GR2 Skeleton):\n When SKIN meshes reference a GR2 skeleton the importer will automatically\n load the gr2 skeleton. The mapping is currently guesswork but works for \n most models.\n \n GR2BoneIndex is set in the User Defined Properties to represent the bone\n index in the GR2 this would not normally change and is just for information.\n \n MDBBoneIndex is set in the User Defined Properties to represent the bone\n index used in the MDB file. This is currently guesswork and is incomplete.\n The Exporter uses this value as the BoneIndex when exporting weights for \n SKIN meshes.\n \n ap_* bones are attachment points for things like weapons, shields, visual \n effects, etc. (LeAdderNoir)\n f_* bones are related to facial features for head-type meshes.\n\n\n Known Issues\n ------------\n None\n\n Change log\n ----------\n 2.3.0\n -----\n o All\n - Add Max 2010 support.\n - Improved Max x64 support\no Exporter\n - Programmatically disable vertex welding for skinned meshes (to avoid indexing bug)\n - Fix issues with skelfile vs skeleton when exporting skinned meshes\n\n 2.2.0\n -----\n o Importer\n - Expand search for gr2 files in lod-merged zip files\n\n 2.1.1\n -----\n o All\n - Recompile for Max 2009\n\n 2.0.1\n -----\n o Importer\n - Fix bug with Max properties which caused crashes in releases less than Max 9\n \n 2.0\n -----\n o Importer\n - Incorporate Expotron User Property Settings into import and export\n - Introduce Scale factor for importing meshes\n - Introduce Vertex Welding option on import\n - Optionally add Normal under Bump map\n \n o Exporter\n - Incorporate Expotron User Property Settings into import and export\n \n o Utility\n - Introduce new \"NWN2 MDB Utility\" which is similar to Expotron Utility\n for setting flags but will function with all versions of the tools.\n","Rating":9.9,"Votes":53,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"28":{"Name":"Align & Distribute","Author":"TAA","Submitted":20061023,"Updated":20061107,"Category":"Toolset","Forum Thread":"Link","SourceIncluded":"No","Patch":"1.00","Description":"This plugin offers basic Align and Distribute functions for placeables.\n\nIt relies on 2da and mdl files for calculating bounding boxes.

This editor will allow you to edit store instances (not blueprints yet). Just drag a store instance onto your map, select it, then launch the RDR Item Creation Wizard.\n\nRDR Store Editor BETA\n-- I'm still working on this, but it's solid enough to use. This is a quick store editor interface I had whipped up before some of the other more fleshed out inventory management plugins came out. This store interface is nice because it is fast and is easy to add and subtract items to. I modeled it after the NWN1 store editor interface.\nWith this editor, you can see the following data about your store items:\n-- Item name\n-- Buy and sell prices at this merchant\n-- Level restrictions (RDR and default)\n-- Quantity in the store (infinite or a limited number)\nAlso, this screen is integrated with the RDR Item Creation Wizard, allowing you to easily edit existing blueprints or create new items using my RDR Item Creation Wizard right from the store blueprint palette. \n-- There is also a quick preview tab you can use to get a fast glimpse of an items properties and stats as you peruse the blueprints in the palette. \n-- You can also launch the default toolset properties window for an item so you can edit any property on the fly.\n\nAll of these features lend to a fast store building experience and allow you to more easily balance the inventories of your store if you are buliding for a Persistent World.\nThis is a BETA versio in that I'm only about 90% done with it, and have a few more details to add. \n\nVersion 3.20\n\n-- Compatible with NWN2 1.04 FULL patch\n-- Fixed automatic filling in of ResRef and Tag when typing item name. Spaces and quote marks are omitted.\n-- Fixed exception when a non-item blueprint was selected then the plugin was launched.\n\nThis latest version IS compatible with the 1.04 BETA patch. \n \n\nVersion 3.1\n\n-- Plugin can now edit existing items. Simply select an item in the blueprint palette and launch the plugin. You cannot edit blueprints that come built-in with this plugin. Make a copy of it first then edit the copy instead.\n\n-- Armor editor now uses models put in your override directory. Tested with Aleanne's female clothing packs.\n\n-- Icon Selector greatly improved. Loads icons much faster and the interface is responsive as it loads icons. Displays more on the screen at a time now.\n\n-- You can now edit the appearance of items like clubs that didn't have editable appearances before.\n\n-- Some tweaks made to the RDR Item level restriction system were made. \n\n-- Numerous small bug fixes.\n\n\nVersion 3.0\n\n-- Item Properties Screen:\n -- Armor Type (for game rules) can now be chosen on this screen.\n -- Material type is now chosen from this interface.\n -- Gold cost is now displayed on this screen. All material and item properties are factored in. \n -- You can now adjust the Base Cost of an item by adding to the Additional Cost field. \n -- You can now see what the item will sell and buy for in stores with any buy/sell value you want.\n -- The level restriction for the built-in system is now displayed.\n -- The number of skill ranks required to ID the item is now displayed.\n\n-- Armor Appearance updated!\n -- The armor appearance editor has been COMPLETELY replaced and is much faster, efficient, and easy to use. \n -- Bugs fixed in the Item Export to Text feature.\n -- Localized string settings now use the same language the toolset is using. \n -- Condensed the DLL Files down. There are now only 2 DLL files you need.\n\nThis plugin allows for fast and easy creation of items. It functions very much like the NWN1 Item Creation wizard. It features a lot of item data being displayed during the creation process, the ability to export your item stats to a text file, a vastly-improved armor appearance editor, and an icon selector.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo install, extract the contents of this plugin to a directory.

In short, it tries to make it more... well, usable, in ways both small and large. Special thanks goes to...\n \n Electrocutor - for showing me how to use the Table layout, which in turn allowed me to fix a couple of long-standing appearance bugs. \n Thoronen - for the idea which brought this plugin into existence\n kivinen for the suggestion of providing useful context menus which were added in 1.04.02.\n Ovocean for most of the icons now in use, and for his invaluable help with the additional features which will be getting added soon :)\n Laban for the idea of ctrl+mousewheel for scaling placed instances, added in 1.11.01\n Hellcow for suggestion visual effect previews which were added in 1.11.02\n the people of #nwn2cr for listening to my aimless, endless rambles about this thing for the last week while I finished the Resource Manager component\n\n\nUsage and Features\n\n When in an area viewer, you can now use the following key combinations, without\nhaving to first switch over the terrain tab. \n \n Alt + Mousewheel: Increase or decrease the inner brush size\n Shift + Mousewheel : Increase or decrease the outer brush size\n Ctrl + Mousewheel\n \n If using pressure brushes, increase or decrease the amount of pressure\n If using water/flatten brushes, increase/decrease the height\n If using grass brush, increase/decrease density\n NEW: if an object is selected (in Select Object mode) that object will be scaled. \n \n \n \n Right-clicking in the area viewer while in select/paint terrain mode gives you a context menu with options relevant to the current brush.\n save current area/file/script/2da/dialog only, without saving the entire module. This is \n available through File -> Save Current View (Ctrl + Shift +S). This will save whatever \n tab is active in the toolset. This is also reduces the risk of errors and \n crashes while saving, since this means that every single blueprint in your module is not \n getting re-written to disk every time you want to save a minor change.\n To prevent possible confusion and the appearance of lost data, this only\n works when your module is saved in Directory Mode. \n All creature, placeable appearances, and now placed visual effects can be viewed by \n choosing the menu option, \"View -> Appearance Viewer\".\n A replacement for the standard variable editor is now available via \"View -> Variables\".\n It offers many advantages over the standard one including more intuitive interface, \n non-modal, and unlike the default variable editor it will not let you add values \n that render a module or area unopenable in the toolset. Once opened the variable editor \n will always reflect the variables on your currently selected instance or blueprint, \n assuming what you have selected supports variables. It does not yet allow editing \n variables of multiple objects at once.\n Current Area Statistics can be viewed by choosing View -> Area Statistics. This gives you \n total numbers of different object types in the current area, and attempts to give \n a VERY rough estimate of load time over a broadband connection. The formula for \n this is still being revised and will hopefully get more accurate over time. \n By enabling the UseSmallIcons option in Preferences (View -> Options -> Plugins -> USability Tools) \n one of the standard toolbars will have icons substituted for text. This saves a lot of \n \"screen real estate\" for those who need it. \n Ctrl+Shift+S to save only the current area, script, 2da, or conversation without having to save \n the entire module. \n Resource manager gives you full control to organize all of your scripts, areas\n and dialogs in the way that you want. Use subfolders, drag and drop organization, filter\n displayed resources, and many more options. This completely replaces the five separate tabs previously\n used for this, and adds considerably more functionality.\n You can now remove the text from the toolbars on the palette and area content lists, \n instead showing icons only. \n Auto reload the last loaded module on startup; the most recent four modules are also now \n available on the start menu. \n A 2da chooser which lets you open multiple 2das at once, and perform filtering/matching\n on the full 2da list to quickly find what you need.\n Area property copy tool, which allows you to selectively copy properties from one area to \n multiple other areas. \n\n","Rating":9.76,"Votes":60,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"47":{"Name":"RePlug","Author":"tani","Submitted":20070207,"Updated":20080919,"Category":"Toolset","SourceIncluded":"Yes","Patch":"1.13","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"unfortunately some developers stopped maintaining their plugins, rendering them useless after the next patch. even more unfortunately there are no sources either.\n\nso i took the liberty to recompile some of the plugins from the dll-files, thus updating the plugins to recent patches.\nthe RePlug package now contains:\n\n- NWN2Mapper (*)\n- TreeCutter\n- M4C Land & Tree Generator\n- WeatherChanger\n- Resizer / Resizer_NP\n- ConversationEditor (only plugin)\n- TempCleaner\n- HotKeyPlugin\n- Align&Distribute\n- AreaCameraASDW\n- ToolsetUIEnhancer\n- RDR Item Creation Wizard\n\ni also added the sources, so you can recompile the plugins yourself whenever you like.\n\n(*) NWN2Mapper\n... does not work well with MOTB addon. thankfully Sothis B took my recompiled code and fixed it. you can find the latest versions here: Link\n\n#######################\nlatest versions can now be found here:\nLink\n#######################\n\n","Rating":9.92,"Votes":69,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"48":{"Name":"BG GUI v2","Author":"Trevor Morris","Submitted":20070210,"Updated":20080523,"Category":"GUI","SourceIncluded":"NA","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"A re-skin of NWN2's GUI that makes it look like Baldur's Gate 2.

As time progressed, the Spawn system became quite useful for many things and it was deemed useful enough to have it separated and made into its own stand-alone plugin.\nThe Spawn Plugin will give you the ability to spawn creatures and placeable objects, anywhere in your world with various options for re-spawning, de-spawning, spawning during certain hours of the day, random spawn locations, and even to spawn from a random a selection of monsters or placeables.

How about zombies that only appear at dusk, throughout the night and disappear again at the break of dawn?
