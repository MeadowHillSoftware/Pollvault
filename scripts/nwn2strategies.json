{"1":{"Name":"Eldritch Knights","Author":"Ceilingcat","Submitted":20061211,"Updated":20061211,"Category":"Prestige Classes","Short Description":"I write guides on different aspects of Neverwinter Nights 2.  This is the second one, but the first I uploaded here (because I need to reformat the Wizard one)","Description":"Eldritch Knights are awesome. They combine the best thing in the game, casting spells, with the most fun thing in the game, stabbing people in the face. When most people think of an Eldritch Knight, they think of throwing a fireball and charging into battle. This is stupid, since direct damage spells suck and Eldritch Knights can�t fight worth a damn without buffs. This guide is about real Eldritch Knights with real ultimate power and how to play them.\n\nRaces\n\nThere are a couple good races for an Eldritch Knight. Those are Human and Dwarf for the Wizard Eldritch Knight, and Human and Human for the Sorcerer Eldritch Knight. If you�re willing to play one of the Bad-Touched races, Aasimars works for Sorcerers and Tieflings for Wizards. I don�t suggest playing an Aasimar though, since the Sorcerer Eldritch Knight is a Paladin and a person can only hold so many sticks up their ass.\n\nClasses\n\nThere are two kinds of Eldritch Knight-Wizards and Sorcerers. Bards cast arcane spells, but they�re totally awesome and don�t need levels in Eldritch Knight. Wizards take 2 levels of Fighter, 8 of Wizard, and 10 of Eldritch Knight and cast totally awesome 9th level spells like Disjunction. Some people might like to get more levels of fighter and less of Wizard, but they�re stupid because no amount of bonus feats compares to 9th level spells. I suggest being a Necromancer, because for some reason Blind Sight is Transmutation.\nSorcerers take 2 levels of Paladin, 8 of Sorcerer, and 10 of Eldritch Knight. They trade the bonus feats for Charisma to saves and a stick in their ass (this is an unlisted Paladin class feature). Because WotC hates Sorcerers, they don�t get 9th level spells. I�m not sure what they get in return, since spontaneous spellcasting doesn�t matter when you only cast a couple of each spell every day, but I�m sure it�s something. I�d say their higher Charisma lets them get laid more, but Paladins are prudes and don�t get laid. Some of these Eldritch Knights trade 2 levels of Sorcerer (and, by extension, their precious 8th level spells) for 2 more of Paladin to get +1 BAB and Turn Undead, which allows them to get Divine Power or Divine Shield. They can only get one, because Obsidian didn�t fix Bioware�s screw-up that prevents you from taking a Divine feat if you�re not taking a level in a divine class. I suggest Divine Shield, because your buffs should cover you on damage. You could also be a Blackguard, which is totally better because you get to wear cool armor and don�t have to be a Paladin. Sorcerer/Blackguard/ Eldritch Knights get the full benefit of their high Charisma scores which, contrary to popular belief, is not the huge bonus to saving throws but rather the ability to have good social skills despite eating babies and kicking puppies.\nA special note for Aasimars becoming Blackguards: You are an Outsider, and contact with yourself is hopefully going to be peaceful. This doesn�t matter in NWN 2, but in D&D that�s a requirement for the class to make peaceful contact with an evil Outsider.\nOh, and your familiar is a Beetle, because it gives you more HP and you�re a warrior. Standard familiar saving procedures apply.\n\nFeats and Skills\n\nThe most important thing to do with feats is to download the fix that allows you to take Practiced Spellcaster. Somehow, it also allows you to take Practiced Spellcaster in online games, which is totally awesome. Once you�ve done that, you take Luck of Heroes as your first level feat because it�s totally awesome. If you�re a Wizard, you took a level of Fighter at 1st level (I don�t know how that works either) and get a bonus feat like Power Attack or Combat Expertise or Knockdown. These are all feats you�re going to have sooner or later, so get whichever one you think is going to be most useful at low levels. If you�re a Sorcerer you took a level of Paladin and don�t get this awesomeness. You might be a Human though, in which case you get it anyway. Your 3rd level feat is Practiced Spellcaster because that�s when you take your first level in a spellcasting class. After that I don�t care as long as you get the right feats, which are Power Attack, Combat Expertise, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Extend Spell, and Persistent Spell. If you�re a Sorcerer you don�t get Persistent Spell because WotC hates you and you don�t get 9th level spells. You might want to get Weapon Focus, which you take in some two handed weapon like the Greatsword or Falchion. There�s no reason for you to ever use one handed weapons.\nThe only skills you care about are Concentration, Spellcraft, and Tumble. You probably have more than that, so go nuts and get Use Magic Device and maybe some other crazy things. Blackguards need 5 ranks in Hide for some reason. Why a heavily armored warrior of darkness needs to be able to hide I don�t know, but I don�t write the rules.\n\nSpells\n\nLevel 1: You take Mage Armor and Shield and you rock the house. If you�re a Wizard you take Enlarge Person and hit things really hard. Except for Mage Armor, you�ll be using these spells forever, so get used to it. Ray of Enfeeblement is an awesome debuff spell and you�ll be using it later. Magic Weapon is useful if you have the slots to spare, but you probably don�t so forget about it.\n\nLevel 2: You get Mirror Image and False Life and people can�t touch you. Then you get Heroism and make up for most of the BAB you lost. Death Armor is silly at this level but gets good later when it doesn�t run out before you finish casting it. Bull�s Strength, Cat�s Grace, and Bear�s Endurance rock the house and you use them a lot. Blind Sight and Darkness is a great combo that makes other people cry. Ghostly Visage is awesome at this level because most monsters don�t have magic weapons. If you�re a Wizard you scribe a scroll of Combust. This isn�t a really good spell, but it lets you set people on fire.\n\nLevel 3: Improved Mage Armor replaces Mage Armor. Note that it stacks with the base armor bonus of your armor (which is a Mithral Chain shirt hopefully made to reduce spell failure) but not the enhancement bonus. It gives +6 as of patch 1.03. Greater Magic Weapon is awesome and you love it and memorize it every day. Spiderskin gives you more AC, and you love AC. It also does some other stuff that�s useful and makes you look cool. Displacement is good for one level until you get Greater Invisibility. Haste will be useful once you can Extend it or are high enough level that it doesn�t go away in 10 seconds. You also want Keen Edge. Rage does something silly like give you someone else�s best class feature for a single spell. Level 3 spells are the ones you really won�t have enough of, which is why Wizards are best and scribe lots of scrolls.\n\nLevel 4: Even though Wizards don�t get these until level 10 and Sorcerers level 11, they still rock. It has silly things like Stoneskin and Greater Invisibility that make people not hurt you, Elemental Shield which kicks people in the nuts whenever they hit you, Wall of Fire and Black Tentacles that let you control the battlefield, and Enervation which never misses and makes people weaker.\n\nLevel 5: At this level you get things like Mind Blank (Lesser) and Spell Mantle (Lesser) and that�s it. You also get Interposing Hand which makes people miss and Firebrand which is the only damaging spell you ever use. You�ll probably use this level for Extended 4th level spells.\n\nLevel 6: At this level you can get Acid Fog and Forceful Hand to make people cry, Globe of Invulnerability Etherealness and Greater Stoneskin to make you unstoppable, and Transformation to turn you into a killing machine. You might also use Stone Body prior to using Transformation because it�s not like you�re going to be casting spells anyway. There�s also Greater Heroism which you cast before every fight, ever.\n\nLevel 7: This gives you Energy Immunity, which you use for Acid so you can stand in an Acid Fog and not get hurt. Later you use it for Fire and Incendiary Cloud, but that�s still 4 levels away. You also get Grasping Hand to make people stay away, Shadow Shield to protect you from the mean Necromancers, and Ethereal Jaunt to buff up while enemies look around going �WTF?�\n\nLevel 8: For protection you now have Protection from Spells and Iron Body if you ever want to risk it. You also get Incendiary Cloud which you stand in while immune to fire and make people take an extra 8d6 damage. Clenched Fist is used to make people cry while you stab them in the face. The only useful Divination spells are at this level, but you took Divination as your barred school and don�t care. Create Greater Undead gives you a friend who helps you stab people.\n\nLevel 9: Only Wizards get these spells because WotC hates Sorcerers. You can do fun things like Disjoin people who rely on buffs or Summon an Elemental to help you or use Crushing Hand to remove people from the fight and slowly kill them. You might sometimes use Shapechange, which is like Transformation on crack if you use the right form. If Energy Drain ever gets fixed it�s another awesome debuff, otherwise it sucks and you never take it.\n\nFighting People for Fun and Profit (Mostly Profit)\n\nClerics and Druids: These guys like to buff up to insane levels and hit you in the face. You don�t like being hit in the face, so you cast Greater Dispel Magic or Disjunction and laugh at them, followed by stabbing them. If they drop something crazy like a Save or Die you laugh because you�re a Wizard and are immune to it. Note that they�re better than you at fighting, but you can dispel them so you don�t care. They can dispel you too, but your spells are better. By a bit, anyway. You might win these matches if you�re smarter than your opponent.\n\nFighters, Barbarians, and Other Brutes: These guys probably fight better than you, but if you buff up you�re better. However, you should make good use of your battlefield control and debuff spells to make them suck before stabbing them in the face. As long as you�re smart you win.\n\nRogues and Assassins: These guys stab you in the back when you�re not looking, so you can�t prepare for a fight. But you can cast Ethereal Jaunt and then kill them. If you can�t cast Ethereal Jaunt you�re dead. Stone Body and friends makes you immune to Sneak Attack, so enjoy it. If you get lucky and don�t die before you can make yourself immune to them you�re good to go.\n\nBards: Bards are like you, but with worse spells and a better singing voice. You dispel their buffs and hit them in the face. Watch out for Curse Song since it screws you over. You might want to Enervate and Enfeeble them before engaging. I don�t know who�d win this fight.\n\nWizards and Sorcerers: These guys are like you but they cast spells better and go �squish� when you stab them. Therefore, you want to dispel their doom buffs and stab them in the face. Hopefully they don�t kill you before you can start spamming Knockdown. Don�t get your hopes up though.\n\nOther Eldritch Knights: The mirror match is tough. You Dispel them and debuff them, and hope you take down more of their buffs than they take off of yours. Don�t bother with battlefield control, since they�re not going to be meleeing you until you�re screwed over. If they�re not smart you win, but that�s standard in a mirror match.\n","Rating":6.81,"Votes":11,"Awards":[]},"2":{"Name":"Elurian's Tectonic Dragon","Author":"Elurian","Submitted":20061212,"Updated":20061212,"Category":"Prestige Classes","Forum Thread":"Link","Short Description":"The Tectonic Dragon (RDD/Blackguard Knockdown Build)","Description":"The Tectonic Dragon \n\nThe Tectonic Dragon is a heavy-duty melee build that capitalizes on what's arguably the most powerful melee feat in the game right now - Knockdown. \n\nIt can literally knockdown CR 20 dragons on a consistent basis (Reds go down about 20-30% of the time, blacks about 50%). It also builds around a very solid melee core, with the ability to reach high saving throw, AC, to-hit and damage marks thanks to the benefits of divine grace, shield and might. \n\nProgression is VERY sensitive here, as you not only have multiple pre-reqs for various PrCs, but you have feats dependent upon classes being taken at the right levels, and you have feats with stat pre-reqs that in turn are dependent upon a PrC. As a result, there's not much room for deviation.\n\nNE/CE Wood-elf\n\nStr 17 +5\nDex 14\nCon 10\nInt 12\nWis 8\nCha 16\n\n1 Brd - Luck of Heroes\n2 Ftr - Power Attack\n3 Ftr - Cleave, Knockdown\n4 Brd\n5 Ftr\n6 RDD (be sure you have 8 lore) WF: Scim\n7 RDD\n8 RDD\n9 RDD Power Crit: Scim\n10 Blck (5 ranks in Hide)\n11 Blck\n12 Blck (Divine Shield)\n13 RDD\n14 RDD\n15 Blck (Divine Might)\n16 RDD\n17 RDD\n18 RDD (Imp Knockdown)\n19 RDD\n20 Fighter (Imp Crit: Scim)\n\nIf you want more a little more DPS and less KD, you can ditch Imp KD for Imp Crit at 18 and take WS: Scim at 20.\n\nStrengths: RDD works very well with knockdown due to the strength bonuses. Knockdown is currently amazingly powerful, and this build puts you extremely close to the maximum available knockdown clout. High AC, high to-hit, high damage, moderate-high saving throws.\n\nWeaknesses: Irresistable spells, though the RDD does have a number of impressive immunities. Low movement speed - I wish I had room for Dash w/o sacrificing core clout. Saves are a little lower than I like, though still fairly impressive compared to most melee.\n\nhttp://nwn2forums.bioware.com/forums/myviewtopic.html?topic=523876&forum=109","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"3":{"Name":"Grim reaper build","Author":"Illuminaughty","Submitted":20061214,"Updated":20061214,"Category":"Prestige Classes","Short Description":"Reap and sow your way to fortune!","Description":"Now this is a little build I had fun making while I was still waiting for the game. Now, he's not really a pvp-build, and there are probably a lot of booring caster-shielders who would fare better than him. But who cares? This build is incredebly fun to play! At lvl 20 he does 200+ damage-crits regularily almost every round, even without magic items, and with superior cleave he's like a living, breathing area-attack! I'd play him just for the people screaming \"OMG HAX\" when they see the ridiculously high damage floating over their heads. Ahhh... Wonderful. So here it is, enjoy :D\n\nNon-lawful Human Str 18 +5 Dex 13 Con 14 Int 13 Wis 8 Cha 8 \n\n1 Ftr - Dodge, weapon proficiency (exotic), weapon focus (scythe), intimidate (4 points)\n2 Ftr - Mobility\n3 Ftr - Combat expertise\n4 Ftr - Spring attack\n5 Ftr - \n6 Ftr - Whirlwind attack, power attack\n7 WM - Weapon of choice (scythe)\n8 WM \n9 WM - Cleave\n10 WM \n11 WM \n12 WM - Great Cleave\n13 WM \n14 FB \n15 FB - Improved power attack\n16 FB \n17 FB \n18 FB - Power Critical (Scythe)\n19 Ftr \n20 Ftr - Weapon specialization (Scythe)\n\nNow the feats that really make this character is the increased multiplier/range of the weaponmaster, which when using a keen weapon (yes, it stacks) gives the scythe a critical of 17-20 x5 (!). Another one is the enhanced power attack on lvl 18, which will give the weapon an impressive +20 to damage (Which is crittable :D) for just -6 to attack (Though this penalty gets serious in pvp). Supreme cleave is also fun, which gives you two free attacks at your full attack bonus when you kill a foe. When fighting low-level mobs this shows as a cloud of \"Critical hit\", \"Great Cleave *hit*\" and \"250\" obscuring your view, as well as a choir of screams. Nothing beats that sight...\n\nAs for skills... I don't really care too much about them. But use magic device is alway handy for those boots of sun-soul and stuff. Craft (weapon) is a must for any server with a good crafting system (Though I have yet to see one). If you still have free skill points, you can never go wrong with spellcraft and tumble.\n\nWeaknesses include (very) high AC-opponents, low will saves in servers without immunity: mind spells, and opponents with crit-immunity (Though he is by no means hopeless against these, having a very high base-damage too). The fact that he gets true ultimate power in the late levels will probably discourage many. But I do think it is worth the wait :)\n\nSo that's my grim reaper! Hope you'll have as much fun with him (or her) as I did. Please ask me if you don't understand why I didn't choose a certain feat/race or whatever, and I'll do my best to answer.\n\nHappy reaping!","Rating":5.75,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"4":{"Name":"Morikal's Weaponmaster Faq (and a ftr/fb/wm build)","Author":"Morikal","Submitted":20061220,"Updated":20061221,"Category":"Prestige Classes","Short Description":"weaponmaster build & weapon choice","Description":"An overview of weaponmaster weapon choice, including single weapon or 2 weapon fighting styles.

Not only do you get a nice Animal Companion who has your back when you're spellcasting, but you also can turn into an animal and bite people's asses or claw their faces off.\n\nIf we think about this focus then we will probably always want to be in wild-shape form when walking about dangerous areas such that stealthed rogues or assassins don't catch you without being uber already. That means we want to have Natural Spellcasting, which lets the Druid cast spells while in wild-shape form.\n\nWe also notice that wild-shape form uses the BAB of the player, not the form, and the AC of the form, not the player. Also, the wild-shape form counts as \"unarmed attack\" so weapon feats must be of that type in order to be effective while wild-shaped.\n\nThus we can see that a level dip of Monk will be useful in getting both feats for unarmed attacks, flurry attack (for an extra attack at a penalty to hit), and a bonus to AC equivalent to the Wisdom score bonus. Since the Druid needs Wisdom anyway for bonus spell levels, and effectiveness of DC for spells, you will want to boost this up anyway!\n\nLevel 9 spells can be cast by a level 17 Druid, so all builds must have at least 17 levels of Druid in order to get these. They are powerful enough to be worthwhile, so missing out on them is a big deal! They include spells like Shapechange, where you can turn into a Horned Devil (awesome!) and still retain your face-punching skills from the level dip of Monk. Mass Cure Critical Wounds is also very nice for keeping your friends, summoned Elemental Swarm (another fine level 9 spell), and NPCs from dying from being punched in the face too many times. You can also take the recommended Extend metamagic feat so you can cast buffs that will end up slotting at level 9 with the metamagic applied.\n\nI recommend reading the following FAQ as well:\n\nLink\n\nThis will let you know some basic needed information about Druids, and has some basic guidelines about what wild-shape focused Druids should care about.\n\nThe final recommended build then is the 1 Monk / 1 Fighter / 18 Druid, and of the Human race. The additional two combat feats from the level of Fighter can aid the Druid in getting Power Attack and Cleave, which are totally awesome in clawing off the faces of everyone around you. Level 18 means that you will still get the last stat change for your Animal Companion, of which you should take the boar which has the best all-round stats (AC and HP). You will have to suffer it not looking quite as cool as the bear. QQ\n\nYes, you will miss out on the final wild-shape forms but the water elemental isn't that different between huge and elder forms and your level dips in Monk and Fighter will give you an edge that a straight 20 Druid will not have.\n\nWith the expansion pack coming out, there will be an additional 10 levels. I would recommend taking at least 6 more in Druid, to get all the final wild-shape forms, spell progression, an epic level feat (hopefully a wild-shape feat such as Dragon Wild-shape, RAWR!), and two more stat increases for your animal companion. Then you can add an additional level of Monk for Evasion, and 3 more level of Fighter for some additional combat feats. The reason for this is that additional levels of combat survivability are better than some junky extra wildshape per day (you aren't ever exiting it, so who cares!?).\n\nEnjoy!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"11":{"Name":"Grim Reaper","Author":"WhiteDaemon","Submitted":20100521,"Updated":20100523,"Category":"Clerics","Short Description":"Grim reaper, good melee and buffer with att spells","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Hey guys, took a look at some previous Reaper builds and decided id come up with one of my own.

This build comes into its own once you get to MoB and get the better scythes, then you will REALLY crank out the dmg.\n\nThere is a way of getting a good allignment reaper, switching the blackguard with a divine champion class, it is also a more effective build as u can get a few more extra feats. to do this, u have to be a bit sneaky with the deity, and spell proffessions. slect jergal as your deity, then choose the undeath and war spell paths. Undeath will give you extra turning (needed for doomguide) and war path will give you weapon focus of deity (scythe). when you come to choosing doomguide u will be forced to change to kelemvor and there you have it, same build, good reaper ^^\n\nSorry if this has been long winded, my first post as far as a build is concerned. Hope you like it, give me feedback on how you feel about it.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]}}
