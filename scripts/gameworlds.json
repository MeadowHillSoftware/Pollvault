If anyone would like to host this module feel free to email plzkthx@optonline.net]\n\n0 - THE UNDERDARK is a hugely expansive persistent world with an intricate, slowly developing plot, plenty of hack-and-slash, and several puzzles thrown in for good measure. \n\nThe concept of the module is to emulate the best parts of MMORPGs and minimize the worst parts. Areas are large, complex, and detailed to the fullest extent of the Neverwinter Nights (Aurora) engine, however they are not so large as to make traveling a repetitive inconvenience. Like in most online roleplaying games, party play is emphasized in order to promote a social gaming experience. Neverwinter Nights and Dungeons & Dragons are, afterall, all about playing and having a good time with other people. To this end, quests are difficult and monsters often fight in balanced, well-organized groups very similar to ones formed by players. Overcoming them will absolutely require teaming up with other players, fortunately, unlike most other servers, parties don't split the experience earned but rather receive an experience bonus that increases in proportion to the size of your group.\n\nOur rules philosophy is simple: don't do anything you wouldn't want the DMs to catch you doing. Use your common sense and things will go very smoothlya--after being active for 2 years we only ever had to discipline a player on one occasion.\n\nAs far as PvP goes, the server is in Party PvP mode. Evil characters are welcome and all players are free to attack one another outside of the confines of town. Of course, you can always TRY to assault someone in town, but I wouldn't recommend doing so within earshot of the guards. We simply ask that you have a reason for killing another player and only go after weaker individuals if they're really asking for it. Homicidal maniacs will be treated as such and may be maimed, killed, incarcerated, or any combination of the three.\n\nRoleplaying is certainly welcome in 0 - THE UNDERDARK, however it is not enforced. We believe that all players should play the game as they see fit. The DMs do occasionally award experience bonuses for particularly outstanding displays of roleplaying, though.\n\n\nSome more features of the module:\n-Over 160 areas\n-Subraces\n-Deity system\n-Custom XP system\n-Custom AI system\n-Player housing\n-Cinematic cutscenes\n-4 major cities to explore\n-Thousands of unique items\n-Thousands of custom scripts\n-Dozens of comprehensive quests and mission","Rating":9.64,"Votes":28,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"10":{"Title":"0 - Tales of the Mabinogion","Author":"Graftark","Submitted":20050324,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Hardcore Rules","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"ttp://nwn.graftark.co","Number Players":"20","Setting":"550-600 AD","Length":"???","Number DMs":"Just myself so far.","IPs":"PW Story","Language":"English","Scope":"Dependant on Module","Hack & Slash":"Light","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"Start at level 1","Magic Level":"Low","Schedule":"Up 24/7!","Treasure":"Moderate","Number Servers":"1","Experience Rewards":"Moderate","PVP":"Mixed","ApplicationReqs":"No Req's!","Vault Type":"Server","Connection":"Cable","RolePlay":"Light","Guild link":"Link","Death Type":"Minor Gold and XP Loss","Content Guide":"Mature","Description":"I created this gameworld to give folks a chance to play in the time of Arthur as according to the Mabinogion.

Don't expect to run to the same tree over and over to fight the same monster to get xp - doesn't happen, most of the monsters are random and don't just stand around waiting for you to kill them. Resting in a spot because it's always been safe before isn't a guarantee. Also most places are more dangerous at night. I built it because I had mu own vision of how a world should be and couldn't find one that suits me. Currently about 100+ areas and growing Above all I hope it is a place you can enjoy yourself.

We've been online and active for over 2 years, and during this time we've run hundreds of plots and quests, from large, world-changing story arcs, to smaller, everyday quests run for high and low levels alike. Over the years, Dragon Coast has welcomed in three eras, each taking place at a different point in history. The current era has been christened \"Erithorn's Might\", and takes place upon the fictional continent of Athus. Erithorn's Might was designed from scratch by a team of builders and writers over a period of nine months. Take a walk across the rooftops of the Red City; climb the snowy peaks of the Orchlan Mountains; visit the sorrowful remains of the ruined forest of Sorfela. There's no end of things to do, and over 650 areas to visit. We're a friendly community of around 250 active players, 13 DMs and 5 admins, so there's always someone to help out or just to roleplay with.

Main Text: The main goal of Elder is to create a long-standing world where characters feel like it is their home. We encourage liberal usage of the /dm channel and for players to engage their DM. Elder requires a hak and a password to use the server. Potential players are asked to post their desire to play on our forums or contact one of the administration via email or PMs. We hope you give us a look, we could always use some new friends around the table.","Rating":9.5,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"182":{"Title":"Elegidos","Author":"s�s","Submitted":20030102,"Updated":20030102,"Category":"Uses Stone of Recall / Town Portal","Number Players":"20-25","Length":"???","Number DMs":"1","Language":"Other","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Magic Level":"Moderate","Schedule":"Aproximadamente:  Laborables (18:30-)  Festivos (casi todo el d�a)","Treasure":"Moderate","Number Servers":"1","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","PVP":"Full PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"25xp por nivel hasta nivel 4  50xp por nivel y 10%gp desde nivel 4","Connection":"DSL","RolePlay":"Heavy","Guild link":"Link","Content Guide":"Mature","Description":"Mundo persistente en desarrollo.

We distributed the Legendary Level system to the community, but have since expanded it greatly, to include nearly every facet of the character from spells to abilities. No where else will you find the legendary system so integrated into the module. Learn what it is like to use level 60 bardsong, play a Pale Master who gains casterlevels and can become a lich, follow the path of the Dragon Disciple and transform into half-dragon fiend, or experiment with a shapestrong barbarian, able to transform into a giant and wield large weapons one-handed!\n\nLegendary Areas\nWith an increase in power a complementary increase in challenge can be found on Higher Ground. Extraplanar areas exist that will give even the most stalwart immortals pause as they are faced with insurmountable numbers of enemies bent on making every step into their domain a player's last. Players will work their way through the planes until they reach the culmination of their adventures, when they are called upon to venture forth into the Nine Hells of Baator, 30 areas swarming with the most deadly devils and fiends imaginable, to put an end to Asmodeus and his invasion of Toril.\n\nSubraces\nWe also feature a \"true\" subrace system, with stackable stat bonuses, feats, appearances, skills, immunities, and more, over 110 in total including large subraces! Play, a yuan ti, a gnoll, a half-ogre, or a pixie! We also feature secret, ultrarare, and beyond ultrarare subraces, such as the Illithid, Treant, or Half-Fiend! Dart in the shadows as a Skulk or tremble the ground with your steps as a Maelephant!\n\nQuasiclasses\nSince Higher Ground prefers not to require players to download additional content apart from CEP, scripting is used to provide diversity by benefiting players with atypical class combinations, creating more than half a dozen quasiclasses. Embrace your draconic bloodline and follow the path of the Sorcerer to become a Bloodfire Mage, wield a sickle with divine precision to effect the magical Weave, healing friend and harming foe, as a Lifethreader, or become an arcane abomination, incapable of being healed apart from your own enhanced regeneration, as the Accursed Pariah.\n\nLoot\nWe feature an incredibly diverse random loot system, with over 1600 hand-crafted items ranging in rarity from Common to Beyond Ultrarare, along with several thousand non-random loot drops. Item Level restrictions are in effect, but extend beyond the standard restrictions to level 50 and 60 items, requiring legendary levels to use. And if that isn't enough, we also feature several types of artifacts, able to grant permanent stat and ability changes. Make the Eye of Vecna your own!\n\nChallenge\nAll of the above wouldn't mean much if there weren't foes to match your terrible powers. Leveling is fast but not effortless, and the dangers only increase as you progress. Players must learn new tricks, advance their skills, and hone their character builds in order to prosper. To this end there is a character building resource available in the forums where players can contribute their builds, discuss build ideas, and even look up several posted builds that have been approved by the staff as successful for use with the starting subraces, a great resource for new players to the module.\n\nCommunity\nA world is nothing without its populous, and the denizens of Higher Ground are what provide for its continued survival. To that end there are several features geared toward community involvement and interaction. The forums are a cornerstone of the community, providing a place to discuss general topics or changes to the module, plan parties, trade items, or organize events. As a player resource there is the HGWiki, a player-edited database of information covering builds, items, areas, subraces, and more. In game there is a banking system, providing persistent storage and allowing for the transfer of items between characters without a third party, a player-run market with auction and buyout only areas, guild support, and a scrying device that allows players to quickly obtain information on their character or on what is happening in all the servers, as well as giving them the ability to communicate with other players/DMs personally across servers or send an announcement to all servers to organize a party.\n\nHigher Ground Enhanced\nSpecific to Higher Ground, HG Enhanced is a separate downloadable hak that is entirely optional. Choosing to download and install it will provide you with additional visual effects, enhanced descriptions highlighting module changes to specific spells and feats, and the ability to use any metamagic feat on any spell that you can cast in order to cast more low level spells by using higher level slots. Future plans for this development could include new visual effects, player and monster appearances, spells, feats, and even tilesets! The beauty of the system lies in its seamless fallback ability, making it not required in order to play on Higher Ground.\n\nSIMTools\nShort for Speech Integration and Management Tools, SIMTools provides a system rich with functionality, allowing players to speak in any one of 54 languages; those who don't speak the language see only gibberish, while speakers get the translated version. Players can create their own chat channels called meta-channels, there is an item renaming function, dice rolling functions, skill check functions, listing commands, and a bunch more, all via simple typed commands. \n\nOur Team\n========\nOur development team has built up over time, with many of our players becoming dms and/or developers, contributing their skills to improving HG.

Mountains will be up North, Shadows Call River going into a sea to the South & Desert to the Farther South. Underdark to the West & Forests to the East and other Types of cities going around. Faction HQ throughout. \n\n\n3. It should use what the NWN game has to offer, such as the now built in crafting system. \n\n\n4. All Classes should have a purpose, Thieves for example will be able to steal for good or bad but not have to give anything back. \n\n\n5. The less rules the better. But what would NOT be allowed is swearing, racial slurs or channel spamming Etc... And in general to not get personal. It is just a game.\n\n\n6. When you fall in battle you will go to a Nexus and be sent to your chosen place such as your Factions/Clans/Guilds HQ�s Hospital/whatever. One way to choose a place is to join a faction like the Mercenary�s Guild by completing a random quest that has to do with Mercenary�s. \n\n\n7. No boring Areas and many quests in each. \n\n\n8. Random encounters that still make sense, NPC that walk throughout many areas. \n\n\n9. No one should come up to you and say, �Hay dude, you can�t do that!� For Example, no stupid rules like a DM telling a thief to give back what he/she stole for any reason. Or told not to steal too much. And everything should be policed by the game it self, Like using guards and scripts. \n\n\n10. Experience and Rewards should be Moderate/not too low or high and should be gained by both Hack and slash and all and any other ways like completing quests and doing deeds.\n\n\n11. You should have many choices & consequences in the Game world to add to your ability to Role-Play.\n\n\nSo on and So forth, I hope you get the idea.\n\n\nI will keep posting an updated map of the world so far\n\n\nIf you want, give me some feed back on it, at my Forum listed below. You can register or not it is ok at this time either way.\n\n\nThanks. And look back for updates because they will come often. like once a week at least.\n\n\nGame Rules: For Example, no stupid rules like a thief having to give back what he/she stole for any reason.

More quests than you'll encounter on other persistent worlds:\nOver the past year and more we have had about 40 scheduled quests run month, not to mention the quests that are run by our GMs 'on the fly'. You can also request character development quests for your character where one of the Quest GMs will then develop an adventure for your character to take him/her in a direction you want to go.\n2. More content than on other persistent worlds: \n- 1400+ Beautiful, hand-tailored areas.\n- Over 1,700 custom-made creatures and clans that were made to inspire players to team up.\n- 1000�s of customized items.\n- Layonara specific Prestige Classes as well as allowing the majority of the original ones.\n- 20 subraces, using dynamic item properties. Including Dark Elves, Tieflings, Half-Giants, Orcs, Goblins, Forest Gnomes, Brownies, Sea Elves, Wemics and several more--not to mention more may be added in the future!\n- Layonara Custom Feats such as Eschew Materials which allow spell casters to ignore the need to carry spell components, Daylight adaptation for underdark subraces and more!\n- An immense Craftable Natural Resources (CNR) system consisting of Armor Crafting, Alchemy, Enchanting, Fishing, Food Crafting, Gem Crafting, Infusing, Musical Instrument Crafting, Poison Making, Scribing, Smelting, Tailoring, Tinkering, Weapon Crafting and Wood Crafting. Several of these were made by one of our Content Team members and were implemented first on Layonara! This CNR list is ever evolving to adapt to players needs and requests.\n- A fairly in depth spell component system that allows either the purchase or harvesting and crafting of components to cast spells.\n- A budding new Deity relationship system, e.g. if you cast a divine spell, it won�t work on characters that follow deities that are hostile to yours.\n- 400+ custom created icons for gem dusts, leathers, poison vials and other CNR items!\n- A fully customized death system. Rather than XP loss at death there are temporary stat penalties to increase the realism of the pain and stress dying causes the body.\n- Fully ride-able horses after a character reaches a certain level.\n- A unique farming system that allows tending to crops, orchards and livestock.\n- Many customized spells that fit with Layonara and its systems.\n- A 356-page campaign handbook rich in history, legends, city and race descriptions, maps and much more that is updated regularly.\n- Player owned houses that can be decorated to your liking.\n\nSo I can change the course of history?\n\nYES! Each character, regardless of his/her level, has a role that fits into the story of the world and even the smallest action can change history and shape things from peasants to gods and houses to continents. The players help to change the world on many levels.\n\nCan I also take my character to Epic levels?\n\nYes you can. We know that on Persistent Worlds many players play hundreds of hours a month, so we do allow advancement up to 40th level but getting there is not an easy task, it takes a long time and possibly a series of Character Development Quests. We currently have a couple Epic level characters as well as several players nearing the threshold. Lower level advancement is fairly quick up to 12th Level. Usually, a very active player can reach level 7 in under a week.\n\nHow do I start playing on Layonara?\n\nGo to our registration page at Link and register for a forum account, for free of course, you'll then get an email with how to start out.\n","Rating":9.9,"Votes":123,"Awards":["Hall of Fame","Reviewers Award"]},"327":{"Title":"Le Cormyr : Les L�gendes du Royaume  Forestier","Author":"Staff Cormyr","Submitted":20050117,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Uses Stone of Recall / Town Portal","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"ttp://www.cormyr.ne","Number Players":"60","Number DMs":"7","Language":"French","Scope":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Dependant on Module","Tricks & Traps":"Dependant on Module","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Moderate","Experience Rewards":"Moderate","PVP":"Party PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Connection":"DSL","RolePlay":"Dependant on Module","Guild link":"www.cormyr.net","Death Type":"Bioware Default","Content Guide":"Teen","Description":"Le cormyr : Les l�gendes du Royaume Forestier","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"328":{"Title":"Le nouveau monde","Author":"Tobrainc","Submitted":20041229,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Uses Stone of Recall / Town Portal","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"ttp://tobrainc.free.fr/foru","Number Players":"1-20","Number DMs":"1","IPs":"169.254.83.220:5121","Language":"English","Schedule":"G�n�ralement 15h/jours,","Number Servers":"1","PVP":"Full PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Perte croissante suivant le niveau","Connection":"DSL","Guild link":"Link","Death Type":"Gold and XP Loss","Hakpak":"Link","Description":"Nouveau continent bas� sur les royaumes oubi�s; Ax� sur la d�couverte et qu�tes a tiroir.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"329":{"Title":"Legacy of the Nine","Author":"tswanderer","Submitted":20040125,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Dramatic","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.61","Website":"ttp://www.deruberhanyok.com/modules.php?name=NWN_Te","Number Players":"1-16","Setting":"Forgotten Realms - Alternate Future","Length":"unlimited","Number DMs":"1 main DM, 2 Co-Dms.","IPs":"68.84.3.51:5124  68.84.3.51:5121","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","Schedule":"24/7","Treasure":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Number Servers":"3","Alignments":"No restrictions, but preferably Good or Neutrals","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","PVP":"Party PvP","ApplicationReqs":"Some common sense, logic, combat awareness, and common courtesy.","Vault Type":"Local","Death":"gold/xp loss, 1-4 random items on person are dropped on adventurer's corpse.","Connection":"Cable","House rules":"Please view the information page on website and the Journals within the module for House rules.","RolePlay":"Light","Guild link":"Link","Content Guide":"Mature","Hakpak":"Link","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"330":{"Title":"Legends of Cormyr","Author":"DM War","Submitted":20030508,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Classic PnP Conversion","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"ttp://www.legendsofcormyr.co","Number Players":"32","Setting":"Forgotten Realms - Kingdom of Cormyr","Length":"No cap, continuous play even for lvl 20","Number DMs":"6","IPs":"64.91.229.40:5123","Language":"English","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All classes","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Magic Level":"Moderate","Schedule":"24/7 persistent world","Treasure":"Moderate","Number Servers":"1","Alignments":"All alignments have a role to play","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Races":"All races PLUS many subraces, see website for details","PVP":"Full PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"When a player dies they lose 50 exp x level, plus 10% of their gold and are transported to a Fugue Plane where they can return to the game world via several portals.","Connection":"T1+","RolePlay":"Light","Guild link":"Link","Content Guide":"Everyone","Hakpak":"Link","Description":"This module takes place in the heart of the Kingdom of Cormyr in the Forgotten Realms.

To advance beyond 20th, you must gain Demi-God status, which involves a series of DM run quests designed just for your character.

As the world progresses and testing goes well, more features will be added to the alpha world. A hakpak is required to play in this world, feating new music tracks, tilesets, cloaks, skies, weapons, hills, and different sized creatures. The world currently has over 200 areas and two fully working towns with dozens of items, monsters, and dungeons. This is a PARTY PW, which means you require a party to play later on, so bring your friends.Sacrifice is meant to span most anyone's interests in a server. RP'ing is encouraged (and rewarded if done well enough), but if you're in a bad mood and don't feel like it but just want to go kill something.. whatever, fine. NPC spawns abound for those of you more inclined to power-leveling and killing, and a good deal of what goes on is dictated by the enthusiasm of the players.

From the start, the server wanted to make a bold attempt to rid NWN of it's munchkinism. A server built upon \"legal\" monsters, a world without cheesy immunity items and +20 weapons. But first and foremost, the purpose of the server is to tell an original story, but not forcing players to a singular gameplay advancement. Roleplaying is optional, however appreciated. Actiongamers should find enough action to be entertained as well as the story oriented people who can delve into the dephts of the main story or the side quests.\n\n\nQUICK STARTING STORY INFORMATION:\nSathmar is a realm where many powers struggle to gain powers, but ancient deities who once were almost lost are now trying to return to the Realm. Such things create additional consequences...\n\nThree Intermediate Powers are trying to reclaim their past glory, and you are becoming a peasant on their board. Or perhaps is it a queen or king? And there is something else. Some weird thing...\n\nWhen you jump into action, the first thing you see is a decaying and renewing place of eternal creation and destruction. You are in Limbo. But you are not destroyed and for some reason brought back into a temporal plane under the control of an Avatar. You have been brought back from the worst of fates for a reason. The different Avatars and servants are not neccessarily very helpful, but there is no doubt you are special in some way even though they might not give you the full story. The only thing you know for certain is that you have died, somehow left in the endless nowhere of unmaking and brought back into the world of the living. For what price, if any, you do not know.

This recently released version includes a total revision of the quest system; plus over 180 quests that have been added or updated. Shroud World is now a Questers paradise. Quests impact what merchants will sell to you, gives you access to special organizations, and opens up whole new quest story-lines based on which quests you have completed.\n\nIn addition to tons of new quests, the player's Fame will directly impact how the inhabitants of the world perceive them. Complete quests for a certain faction and they may offer to sell you unique and fantastic items; fail to aid someone and you may be considered an outsider and certain benefits become unavailable.\n\nHundreds of new items have been added including special augments that can be used to increase the power of your magic items; effectively allowing you to have some say in what benefits your equipment provides. A brand-new and totally custom Alchemy system allows the dedicated crafter to advance in two different lines of potion making (Divine and Arcane). These powerful potions offer some unique benefits like instant teleportation to far off places or the power to dramatically disable your opponent.\n\nWe are very excited to offer these new changes added to Shroud World, one of the oldest persistent worlds that has been enjoyed by thousands. Shroud World, a world built by players for players also offers, as always, the opportunity for players to cross-over and help continually develop the game world.\n\n\nShroud World would also like to Announce.....\n\n\n...the opening of Shroud World - Epic, a second SW server specifically designed to challenge characters levels 25-30+. The Epic server holds true to the desperate and dangerous feel of the original server but with a twist all its own that can only be termed as deadly for the unprepared. With over 200 areas and dozens of quests and adventures, the Epic server offers tons of new possibilities. If you are an old school Shroud World player that feels he or she has bested our world, its time for a rematch.\n\nAlso upcoming to the Shroud World - Epic server is the release of Fungus Pit, a level 20-25 adventure where you dare to challenge the fungus creatures in their lair of moss and mold. Fungus Pit includes 10 epic level quests, 16 oozing areas of putrid foes waiting to slime you, and of course, a final encounter with the Avatar of Krell. This new adventure has all the tricks and traits that have always made Shroud World the place to adventure for the stout of heart.\n\nAlso upcoming to the Epic Server is the Planar Rift adventure, a 10 area adventure into the extra-dimensional. In addition, we will soon be adding Amber Pendragon's Murder Mystery Adventure. For more information, visit us at the Ezboard Forum: 080.ezboard.com/bapex71990\n\nWe look forward to seeing you and hope you have as much fun with these new features as we had creating them\n","Rating":9.95,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"512":{"Title":"Faces of NWSigil","Author":"Grimrider","Submitted":20031215,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.67","Website":"ttp://nwsigil.tripod.co","Number Players":"1-20 players","Setting":"Planescape","Length":"Varies b/c of Multiplayer","Number DMs":"3","IPs":"62.248.153.171:5130","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"1-30","Magic Level":"High","Schedule":"24/7","Treasure":"Moderate","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Alignments":"All alignments welcome, but no psychopaths.","Experience Rewards":"Moderate","Races":"All.

It's a server focused on Roleplaying, and the DM's reward good roleplayers frequently. It's a large module with over 300 areas, but it's built in a way that ensures you will most likely meet with a few people instantly when you log on. PvP is allowed as long as there is a RP reason for it, for example just being evil is not enough. Levels range from 1-40, and levels over 25 will be a reward for excellent roleplaying and involvement in the world. The island of Thain lies west off the Sword Coast. We use a lot of Forgotten Realms references, but if your character is from another setting, we don't have a problem with it. So come join us roleplaying on an excellent module with an all new DM team, all new areas added, and CEP content just in! :)","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"555":{"Title":"Thain","Author":"BitRaiser and Handover Phist","Submitted":20041212,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://www.thain.org[/url","Number Players":"64","Setting":"Loosely based on Forgotten Realms","Number DMs":"10 spanning PST to GMT+1","IPs":"95.166.112.28","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All classes welcome.","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"Soft cap at level 20; Epic levels by DM reward only.","Magic Level":"Low","Schedule":"24/7","Alignments":"All alignments welcome.","Races":"Monstrous sub-races for Drow, Tiefling, Half-Demons, etc. require DM permission.","PVP":"Party PvP","ApplicationReqs":"No application required (except for monstrous sub-races).

Urath is a world where a community of heroes struggles against adversity. In the First Age of Urath, all was chaos, but there arose a force to counter it, the Word. As the Word fragmented, the power of the Word became Magic and the Gods were formed. The Gods used their might to create Urath, forming stone and earth, water and ice, fire and flame, mist and air. The last remnants of the Word were scattered. In the 4th age, the heroes hoped to unite the Lore of the Word by discovering myths and histories, ancient artifacts, and places. Instead, they got a second gods war that devestated the world. In 5th age, it is 3000 years later. The heroes are learning what has happened, and making there way in a world that has changed. The server is updated by the Dev team to reflect changes to the world made by the players daily. Events are held almost daily. Come and try us out!\nThis is an RP rich world. Character vs. Character conflict does exist, but only for In character reasons. You may opt out of it if you wish. There is a small hak linked below that is nessecary as well as CEP.

Not just \"three levels of goblins, undead, and demons with a boss at the lowest level who holds the big treasure\", our areas are designed with atmosphere, server messages that reveal \"flavor text\" like the old boxed text from early edition D&D modules, creative placement of traps and secret doors, and custom-made monsters.\nRoleplaying - Heavy. Players are encouraged to write a background for their PCs and submit it to a special forum, accessed only by DMs. This allows for you character's secrets to remain her own, but lets the DMs in on her true nature, goals, loves and hates. DMs use these backgrounds to plan \"milestone events\", small plots or encounters centered around your PC specifically when she passes a \"milestone\" in leveling - taking the first level in a PrC, becoming epic, becoming an epic PrC, etc. These should be major points in a character's development and the DMs do what they can to make them memorable.\nHack/slash - That depends on how you want to play. If you want to go all the way to level 40 by camping a single spawn, go ahead. If you want to gain your levels strictly through RP and never pick up a weapon, go ahead. Silver Spire is designed to uphold a \"play how you like\" atmosphere. We do not punish powerlevelers, we do not ignore RPers. If you are enjoying yourself and not preventing anyone else from having fun, you are welcome here.\nTreasure - Dependent on the efforts of the player. The milestone events are often concluded with a unique piece of custom gear developed specifically for your character. Also, there are NPCs located around the server that will alter the appearance of armor, shields, helms, and weapons so that you can completely customize your character's appearance. Found some +3 full plate, but you hate the gauntlets and want more spikes? Take it to the artisan and make it look however you like. Also, all the dyes in the game are available from another NPC, so your cleric of the Red Knight does not have to run around in bright purple armor anymore. (Unless he just likes purple.)\nExperience rewards - High. DMs frequently give out rewards for good RP or taking on challenges. A custom xp script runs so that every creature will always give a minimum of 1d4 xp. No more having to seek out the most remote and dangerous creatures just to get xp at high levels - everything's worth something.","Player Requirements":"Players must be 18 or older.","RolePlay":"Medium","Description":"Silver Spire is a splinter plane of the Forgotten Realms.

The known world, a single continent known as Tharbanm, has all but abandoned technological progress as magic had been harnessed and tempered to the whims of the races.\n\nThe beginning of recorded history is all but lost, as Torak the Lich has stolen away from the Great Library a great many tomes of knowledge. Whispers of rumor spread that this once black knight is trying to cover up some plan that may have been exposed by heroes of old. Humans fight amongst themselves over territory, Elves have become divided into two major factions, and other older races have made themselves more known throughout the land beyond their borders.\n\nA blend of unique script systems are the core of this world, thanks to our Resident Coder, GwynWynn. Highlights of our world:\n\n * MODIFIED CRAFTABLE NATURAL RESOURCES: Recipes have been added, replaces, and even removed to reflect the nature of our world. In the trade and barter societies, the players contribute much to the economy. Many aspects of the crafting system have been altered to make it more simple, but still challenging enough to make it fun and worthwhile.\n * ORDER OF THE HEALING HAND: Throughout the known history, the Order of the Healing Hand have dedicated themselves to helping others, regardless of race, gender, or alignment. They do no harm, and no harm is done to them. They have many field priestsess' who show when one has crossed the threshold of death. They do not do this for free, either -- they have to eat too. They'll take your gold (if you have more than 1000) and leave. If you have less than 1000 gold however, they will take your gold and some of your items chosen at random. If you are unlucky enough to have no gold and an empty inventory, they will strip you of your armor and anything else you are wearing, at random. If you have nothing of value, they will heal you for free, as they are required to heal everyone in need.\n * D100 SYSTEM: The original Pen and Paper game this is based on was built with a d100 system instead of the DnD d20. Many dice rolls have been reflected in our world to accomodate this.\n * PERSISTENT CHEST SYSTEM: We are using a modified version of the persistent chest system found on Markshire.","Rating":9.75,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"729":{"Title":"Sollice PW","Author":"Sollice Development Team","Submitted":20050528,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires Both Expansions (SoU & HotU)","Website":"ttp://www.sollice.ne","Number Players":"40","Setting":"A 3-island original world.

A true living place to experience.\n\nThis PW is a PnP 2nd Edition World made by a 10+ year vet of PnP DnD where the player was always the one that caused their own adventures, where it be a bar fight or a dragon take down. It was the players that found their own pleasures and so it is with this world. It has tried to stay true to the old adage of the PnP world \"The player makes his own mess and the DM plays along\". This is not to say that DMs do not get involved, that they do by helping to facilitate the mess the player may have or may not made and reward them accordingly.\n\nFirinn of Elisair is different in that it has an actually character creation module that is run independent of the main module. Once a character is made there, then they are sent to the main mod for game play. It is all a seamless process, but the reason for the separate module is for the new IGCC by the PC Consortium, that has been modified by us, to allows for more precise character creation, no more worrying about picking the right main class to get the subrace, our scripts will set you up correctly, through a simple conversation within the world. We even have head galleries to find exactly what it is that you are looking for.\n\nFirinn of Elisair contains the following \n1. Custom Races \n2. Custom Classes \n3. Custom Death and Respawn system \n4. CNR Crafting \n5. Over 430 area's to explore and re-explore (more being added all the time)\n6. Hundreds of unique items at your disposal \n7.

It is hard for some people who have real life knowledge about the Mod's setting of Icewind Dale. You may have read all of R.A. Salvatore's books on the subject, but your character has not, so your character, for the most part, does not know the NPC's or the lay of the land.\n\n2) This server is a Full PvP server. Try not to randomly kill off the newbies. While this is not forbidden, it is not really a nice thing to do. The way to tell a newbie's status is if you see that they are listed as being \"Effortless\". Killing other characters should be done from a role playing stand point. If you are killed by someone do not log off and log back in as your 40th level character to seek revenge. That is metagaming and it is tacky. If you attack a character that is much stronger than you and you get killed off, do not complain to a DM.\n\n3) No sexually explicit conversation is tolerated, in or out of character.\n\n4) No harassing other characters out of character. Any jibes or insults must strictly be done in character.\n\n5) All things happening on the server will stay on the server. Do not bring any conflict from the game to the real world.\n\n6) No exploitation of the mod. Any bugs or issues should be brought to the attention of the DM.\n\n7) Please do not ask to be made a DM of the server. DM�s may be added if the future at the owner�s discretion.\n\n8) Twinking is when a player has sufficient xp to level their character but chooses not to level them so that they may continue to collect more xp that would normally be rewarded to a lower leveled character. Doing this may result loss of gold or xp.\n\n9) Items lost due to timing out of the server and/or poor internet connections will not be replaced. While this may seem harsh, there is no way for us to know if a claim is legitimate or not. \n\n10) Please refrain from using character names from established characters in Forgotten Realms. We would all love to be Drizzt or Elminster, but to be fair to everyone else please use a more original name.\n\nMore guidelines may follow as time goes by. Any questions, comments, and complaints should be directed to the DM only. OOC Conflicts between players should be brought to the DM's attention.

There are no hardcore rules.","Connection":"T1+","House rules":"Link","RolePlay":"Medium","Description":"Soul Forge is one of the oldest and most popular persistent worlds on listed on Gamespy, having been active and blooming since June 2002.\nWe have a very experienced and friendly staff and player base combined with a vast continent waiting to be explored by you and your fellow friends and adventurers.\nSoul Forge is available 24/7, so whenever you feel the urge to play, we're here for you and you are very likely to find friendly players willing to chat with you or help you out in getting started.\n\nFor many of us, players and staff alike, Soul Forge is much like a second home and an alternate reality. Whether you wish to become a great and powerful adventurer, a wealthy capitalist, or just sit around the tavern telling your tales over a hearty ale, Soul Forge offers you all these opportunities plus countless more. Because at its heart, Soul Forge is a persistent world created for every gaming type, we welcome everyone and are happy to be home to both serious role-players and skilled power gamers.\n\nCurrently our world offers the gamer many things of which a few are listed below:\n\n- A unique setting with an ancient and ever growing story, written and experienced by both DMs and players. As there are few limits to the human mind, so is the storyline of Soul Forge you can participate in any day.\n\n- A reasonable and steadily increasing level and wealth progression. Soul Forge offers a reasonable pace of experience and gold/equipment where you cannot build your character to 40 in a day, but need weeks of playing. In addition, gold is not as abundant as on many other PWs but leads you to making decisions instead of buying everything.\n\n- A modified CNR tradeskill system. For those players who wish to progress as capitalists and businessmen, our tradeskill system allows you to make gold either selling your wares in game to PC's or NPC's. To allow for selling of wares to NPC's, we have developed item pricing that allows to make a steady living as a crafter without being the ultimate source of gold. To make crafting more attractive, experience is awarded at a reasonable level for reaching the higher stages of a craft.\n\n- Although equipment can be bought from shops and made via tradeskills, the best equipment is not shop bought but acquired from vanquishing the greater evils of the Soul Forge. In your travels, you may come across one or the other very rare items.\n\n- An attentive staff that listens to player suggestions. We are happy to listen to players suggestions as long as they presented in a non-abusive manner. We have, over time, implemented many player suggestions into Soul Forge. While we will not implement or change things we feel are not needed or benefit the player base as a whole, we will gladly take your suggestions into account and discuss them amongst us and other players.\n\n- Interesting and numerous magic items. You will find few to none standard BioWare created items on Soul Forge, as we have put a lot of our time into making magic items that are not overpowering, yet give the players access to useful and needed equipment. We have also created a custom ILR system that allows us to make epic items that players can work toward, and also items that attempt to make all classes enjoyable and useful to play. Whichever path you choose, you will have something to strive towards and work for.\n\n- Many different dungeons and terrains for combat. We offer challenging dungeons for every level and type that have well defined back stories and plots. Travel to lost elven cities, bandit lairs, the Underdark, and kingdoms on other planes. We also have epic dungeons for the truly powerful that take players to long forgotten ruins, ancient temples, vampire keeps, and into the bowel of the abyss itself.\n\n- A modified spell system that allows casters to be efficient past 20 and up until 40 by uncapping most spells and adjusting others.\n\n- Soul Forge offers many means of transport across the realm as perma haste is not an option here due to balance reasons. Thus we have implemented horses to carry you to your destination, wherever it may be and portal stones which bring you back to safe havens should things go bad or you just wish to regroup with your party. Further instruments of travel are available as well, such as coaches which link towns with each other and boats that take you from one island to the next.\n\n- Party play is greatly encouraged on Soul Forge as you will receive no experience penalty whatsoever for being in a party. While parties are only possible across certain level ranges for anti-powerlevelling reasons, they will enable you to travel with your group from 1 to 40 in a few weeks and convey a sense of accomplishment to you.\n\n- We want you to enjoy our PW as much as you can and for that we are constantly available and there to help you not only in game but also on our forums. Our players welcome those who are new and are likely to talk to you extensively and do what they can to get your started. Also, the server will reset every 4 hours to reduce any lag that should occur and area clean up scripts are in place to tidy up junk that has been dropped. Between server resets, messages will be sent out to all players to warn of the upcoming reset and a PvP minigame lasting at most 10 minutes will run for the so inclined. If you don�t wish to participate, you won�t have to as it is entirely optional.\n\n- All areas have been designed with great detail and care so you will find detail rich and picturesque places along your travels which drive you onwards in your adventures. To achieve this, several small sized haks had to be used which are even downloadable by modem users.","Rating":9.91,"Votes":25,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"744":{"Title":"Ansalon - The World of Krynn (AWOK) Dragonlance(r) on-line NWN Superworld","Author":"OverlordNZ","Submitted":20050704,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Capture The Flag","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"ttp://www.iwgn.net/nw","Number Players":"18","Setting":"Dragonlance World","Length":"Immense!

Those 5 dragons, each embodying one elemental aspect: fire, water, earth, air and ice recovered the weapons which, now that their wielders were slain hat gained evil un-life and sealed them away each for itself.\n\nCenturies past and the influence of the demons grew but there was still hope for a prophecy of old spoke of a group of heroes would arrive when the battle seemed lost, to gather the shattered pieces of the stone and reinstate it's power to return Kyralyos from his exile and drive away the evil once and for all.\n\nThe 'heroes' of this world are young, unexperienced adventurers who seek fame and fortune and thus booked a passage to an archipelago far away from their homes. They arrive at the port of 'Eressea Island', where they make their first step towards heroism. Here they also meet the first representants of the 'Brotherhood of the Serpent', an ancient order which is cooperating with the 5 guardian dragons to keep up the balance in the world and now as peace is at stake - seek for the foretold heroes to free the world from evil.\n\nThe brotherhood will watch the young adventurers become more and more experienced and at a certain point invite them to come to the 'Heroes Academy', a facility where they can outfit themselves and are given quests after quests until they are ready to face the evil intruders, gather the 5 pieces and return Kyralyos.\n\n//// WORLD DETAILS ////\n- Dedicated server at 68.146.103.39 (GameSpy>Action - Islands of Eccaira)\n- 350+ areas currently and growing\n- CEP 1.53 and nwn expansions required\n- There is a rest system in place (8 game hours between, careful how you unload your spells!)\n- Previously food was required for rest to occur, this has been removed\n- Magic items are common in this world, immunities are not\n- Item craft system in place so players also have the option to forge their own items with properties they choose\n- Hack and Slash is fairly high, though this is not a rapid XP/levelling server\n- Encounters scale based on party size and level\n- Many scripted quests throughout the mod, more are being added regularly\n- PVP is frowned upon except in the arena\n- Persistant Bank system (store loot and items)\n- Fishing system in place, buy a pole/bait and certains areas can be fished, various items lay below the waters \n- Subraces available\n- Online Forums at: http://p2.forumforfree.com/clantzi.html \n\n//// SUBRACES ////\n- Gold Dwarf \n- Duergar \n- Shield Dwarf \n- Drow \n- Moon Elf \n- Sun Elf \n- Wild Elf \n- Wood Elf \n- Swirfneblin \n- Rock Gnome \n- Ghostwise Halfling \n- Lightfoot Halfling \n- Strongheart Halfling \n- Aasimar \n- Air Genasi \n- Earth Genasi \n- Fire Genasi \n- Water Genasi \n- Tiefling \n- Fey (Pixie ) \n- Goblin \n- Kobold \n- Minotaurs \n- Ogres\n- ... and more! \n\nAll of these subraces alter the stats of your character, some are stronger, others have more dexterity and so on, of course sometimes stats are decreased as well.

However, we've found that often times we need to write down what should be common sense ideals followed by any repectful or mature player. However, most of what you'll find here are guidelines, suggestions, descriptions and clarifications to help make both your experience on Stormcall and the experience of others a more fun and enjoyable one. \n\n** SEE RULES POST **  www.stormcall.org ","Player Requirements":"Standard of Conduct\n\nStormcall is a server that is occupied by people from many countries, cultures, and back grounds. Each person�s personal experiences enrich the server itself (yes even those silly hockey loving Canadians). There is however one constant and that is a standard of conduct that each player is expected to uphold. \n\nStormcall expects its players to conduct themselves in a way that is appropriate to people of all ages. This is not a way of us dictating how your character acts or how you as a player act. These standards are a guide to help you better communicate with the DM staff and other players. \n\nA good attitude will get you farther than a bad one. Getting mad and popping off at someone NEVER gets you what you want. If you feel that you have suffered some injustice calmly plead your case to the offending DM/person. A carefully worded discussion will work wonders compared to a violent flame. When you abandon reason and begin a verbal assault on someone you show no desire to actually correct the situation. If we think you are just flaming you have lost the ability to communicate with us. \n\nSolve problems at the lowest level. If there is a problem between two players then those two players should strive to solve it on their own. If an agreement can not be reached then get with a DM. DO NOT post on the forums that so and so did you wrong and that you hate them. An open flame on the forums again will not get you very far. If the problem is with a DM or multiple DMs, send a private message on the forums or IRC. Open flames on the forums will not be tolerated. Flaming of that nature just shows that you are not willing to actually solve the problem. Expect open flames on ANYONE (DM or player) to be deleted quickly. \n\nReasonable conversation indicates a level of intelligence. If you can convey your disappointment in an intelligent way people respond well to you. If you bring nothing to an argument but irrational banter you will not reach your desired goal. Inform the offending party what they did and when they did it. Sometimes people never even knew that they were doing something to upset you. \n\nBottom line this is elementary stuff but it needs to be said. Treat people civil and you will be treated civil back. Flames get deleted and continual flaming gets you banned. Be smart and help to make Stormcall a welcome place for new people and veterans alike to enjoy. \n","RolePlay":"Heavy","Forums":"www.stormcall.org / www.thestormscall.com","Description":"Sporadic white clouds roll across the bright blue sky. How many years now had it been since the sky had torn? Red the color of blood ran like water across a black sky as the ground heaved and fell breaking apart. Infernal beasts walked the land leaving a path of destruction in their wake. But as quickly as it had begun a brilliant and blinding white light swept the earth and the ground leapt once more and finally settled where it now rests, still broken. Many have wondered if the land will ever be restored, some ask if it can be. The Gods have fallen silent since that day and truly how much can mere mortals accomplish without them. Will they ever return? An Emperor has ascended to the throne but the cobblestones still crawl with rumors of political intrigue and infighting. The North is naught more than a battle field as the war with the Orgog Hordes boils and simmers. Even the Emperor's own capital city stands not far from a fetid and stinking swamp which belches forth all manner of vile creatures.

Respect others in the game and that means everyone from the DMs to the people you really can't stand.\n\n\n\n\n2. Try not to shout unless you have something important to say.(Examples are 1. Your looking to sell something, 2. You are new and need a little assistance, 3. You wish to form a Party, 4. Or if you need DM assistance and no one is Answering the DM Channel.) Now All Shouts are to be one shout only and those who wish to reply must do so in a TELL and never in a shout.\n\n\n\n\n3. This server is for role players as well as hack 'n' slash so try to stay in character. And if you simply cannot get along with each other then just stay away from each other. I don't wan't a bunch of crap about such and such won't RP cause no one is forced to Role Play here. However if your not into Role Play then please respect the ones who are and Do Not Ruin their time by making things Difficult for them.\n\n\n\n\n4. You will not be booted out or banned from the game just for voicing your opinion about the mod, however you can be booted or banned if you slam people or anything that may be offensive to the masses and inappropriate. so use some better judgment.\n\n\n\n\n5. Player vs. Player - Simple rules if you wish to player vs. player you need to keep it in character and both parties must be agreed to the fight. if you Pk on a regular basis and its out of role play and you are doing it against the wishes of the other player then you will be warned and the next offense will get you banned permanently and your player characters will be deleted. so keep it straight or else.\n\n\n\n\n6. Spell Stacking is forbidden Example is Elemental Shield it is known that if you stack over a certain amount of Elemental Shield then you can crash the server and if it is evident that you are doing this you will be warned but if you continue to do so then you will get banned permenantly.\n\n\n\n\n7. Threats against the Server or anyone Playing in it. I have heard people get mad at DMs and start spouting that they will crash the server and that will get you a one way ticket to Bannedville. Also making threats againt other players will not be tolerated (now I am speaking of real life threats not saying your going to hunt their character down and kill them cause they accidently hit you with a spell) But this will also get you a one way ticket to Bannedville.\n\n\n\n\n8. Using Profanity - Ok here is the base of it all. Don't shout out cuss words, Dont speak them in public if your going to offend someone. Just try to have some taste and tact and don't offend anyone. If you do I will warn you once and then it will be boot city. I am an adult and I put a warning in the mod description that this is an adult server and many ideas and concepts that adults talk about are present and if a child cannot handle it then they should not come in. However try to have some sense about it and keep it all in Role Playing format, and respect others.\n\n\n\n\n9. Steeling/Pickpocket from other players is not alloud. \n\n\n\n\n10. Spel casting in town against other players and NPC's is not alloud. So don't do it, it gets you banned (Buffs are alloud)\n\n\n\n\n11. Using known and unknown bugs in the game is not alloud, please report bugs to the DM and don't use them for your one profet, you will get banned.\n\n\n\n\n12. Duping items is not alloud (item copy bug), it will get you banned or your account gets delete.\n\n\n\n\n13. Steeling drops from players who just killed a boss is not alloud, the person who killed the boss his name is been shout by the boss that person has the right of looking first at the drop and take whatever he wants, when he is done with the drop other players may have a look add it. Note ! if a player spawn in a monster and is not part of a party and a other player killed the monster the player who spawn the monster has the right of looking at the drop first, this is because players sometimes do nothing and only get the last stroke to get the right of the drop.\n\n\n\n\n14. The server is english based so please talk english, it is alloud to talk your one language in a party chat channel\n\n\n\n\n15. Dungeon Master's are not responsable for losing items after a reset or crash of the server, this sort of bad luck just happens to everybody now and then. So don't get hostile to DM's when you lose some items there is nothing that can be done about it, and there are enough drops in the game to get your items back.\n\n\n\n\n16. When you get yourself killed in-game please accept this, get someone to res you, but dont use the logout/login bug from neverwinter to avoid the consiquensies from the death script.\n\n\n\n\n17. To help yourself and other players there are some thinks you can do to reduce server lag as much as possible. (Examples are 1. Don't drop items on the floor in rogue encampment or other city's, please put them into the trashcan. 2. Try to kill the monsters that you spawn, don't run arround in the world spawning monsters without killing them. 3. Try to direct connect to the server. 4. Try to avoid login/logout to many times in a short period of time) we are not running a hard policy about this rule but it might get you into jail when you disregard the rule.\n\n\n\n\n18. Jumping others to waypoints to rush the game is not alloud. Jumping lower level toons by those more accomplished players from waypoint to waypoint to rush the game to Act X is not alloud. When someone can't find a waypoint and they ask for help and someone is given them the change to jump that is not a problem, but don't rush someone from Act I to X.  \n\n\n\n\n19. It is not forbidden to play with your high-end gear in lower Acts. Remember that it is nice to have [Epic], [Victory], [Uber] and [Hell] tagged items but for the best game experience try to play with the items that are tagged for that Act, it will give you the most balance and fun to play.\n\n\n\n\n20. Give new players a change to play the game in his full experience. So please don't give high-rank gear to new players, we can not always avoid that from happening but we don't encourage it. Items can be removed by a Dungeon Master when noticed.\n\n\n\n\n21. Try and have fun that's what were all here for.\n\n","Content Guide":"Everyone","RolePlay":"Light","Guild link":"Link","Forums":"Link","Description":"Since the Beginning of Time the forces of Order and Chaos have been engaged in an eternal stuggle to decide the fate of all Creation. That struggle has now come to the Mortal Realm...And neither Man, Demon, nor Angel will be left unscathed...\n\nDiablo, Lord of Terror, and youngest of the Three Prime Evils, awoke from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo took control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo gripped the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. \n\nUltimately, as even Khanduras' good King Leoric fell under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arose to challenge the darkness that had engulfed the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronted the Lord of Terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit could never be truly destroyed, the hero took the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will could contain the demon within. The hero could never have known that his selfless act would not only ensure Diablo's victory, but would irrevocably damn his soul for all time. \n\nAs Diablo II opens, the hero, after containing Diablo's spirit, has journeyed to the East, and has assumed Diablo's original appearance and power. He has gone to the East to raise an army to aid him in his conquest of the world. Diablo's plans become revealed as the game progresses; he desires to free his brothers, Baal (the Lord of Destruction) and Mephisto (the Lord of Hatred), to reinstate the Prime Evils, the triumvirate of evil. \n\nThis copy off blizzard Diablo II contains Act I to V but it goes on when Act V is finished and Baal is defeated.\n\nThe Worldstone is gone, shattered into a million pieces. With the Worldstone gone, the human world and the demon world are now easy to pass between. Dozens of gates have appeared allowing demonic hordes access to the world. Humanity has not even had time to recover form the escape of the prime evils, and isolated forces are being driven back. Walled cities provide humanity's last refuge. \n\nThe end of the Worldstone has also brought changes to demons and the demonic realms. They are now mortal, and with this knowledge, the demons are less eager to throw their lives away, as death means oblivion rather than inconvenient banishment. This new-found recalcitrance has given humanity respite from the assault. Humanity's control expands one again, and now the world is split into areas controlled by demons, and areas held by people.

Karameikos is a heavily forested land bounded by mountains to the north which form its natural border with the Republic of Darokin. To the west is the nation of Halflings called the Five Shires. To the north and east, across the vast Altan Tepes mountain range, is the mysterious desert nation, The Emirates of Ylaruam. To the east is the mighty Empire of Thyatis, from whence the ruler of Karameikos, Grand Duke Stephan Karameikos III, hails. To the south are the island lands of the Minrothad Guilds and the Kingdom of Ierendi.\n\nYou are recently arrived in the small mining town of Threshold, set within the northern wilds of Karameikos. \n\nAll but forgotten by Duke Stefan Karameikos, currently distracted by a bloody war in Thyatis, Threshold was reduced to rubble by the deathless forces of the lich Archak. Against all odds its people put aside their differences and overcame the undead wizard, yet could not destroy him forever. Under the guidance of the town council and the newly appointed Knight Commander of Threshold the people slowly rebuild their shattered homes, and the town looks set to prosper as never before. \n\nYet shadows gather all around this island of civilisation. Beneath the Black Woods Archak slowly regains his strength, biding his time for revenge. The grim armies of the Black Eagle Barony lie close by, always seeking to further the ambitions of the Duke's tyrannical cousin Ludvig von Hendriks. Dragons swoop from the skies, monstrous golems wander the wilds and a sinister force infests the very stones beneath the citizens' feet. The greatest threat to the town is none of these, however. Chaos and disorder stalk the streets, and heroic leaders must either bring the rag-tag assortment of adventurers together against their common foes or be lost amidst a tide of darkness.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nMystara: Mystara is the name of a world used in the original D&D boxed sets and also later adapated to AD&D 2nd Edition. It is the world in which this PW is set.\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Karameikos: The Duchy is officially ruled by Duke Stefan Karameikos who twenty or so years ago came over from a neighbouring land, the huge empire known as Thyatia, and conquerered it's indigineous population, the Traladarans. Karameikos still remains a wild, dangerous and largely unexplored land with baronies of the duchy being fairly independant and loosely scattered across it.\n\nPlayers may choose to start in the northern frontier town of Threshold, or as a raw recruit in the nefarious Black Eagle Baron's private army. From these bases, the world is open for hundreds of hours of exploration and high adventure.\n\nFurther details of the setting background are provided at the following:\nhttp://games.swiftdsl.com.au/showthread.php?t=1148\n","Length":"Huge world, with 300+ detailed areas to explore.

Prestige classes locked, but available later via in-game actions or DM award.","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"1-36 (levels 37-40 are reserved for Immortals)\n\nEpic Levels\n\nEpic Levels are locked, and level 21 must be unlocked only via a DM Quest (DMs will unlock using their Level Time Wand). In additional, any further Epic Levels (22, 23 etc.) will also only be achievable via successfully completing DM Quests, after spending at least 14 real-life days at their current level. These �Epic Quests� will generally provide a considerable challenge to the PC, but on successful completion (if success is met), enough XP will usually have been earned to immediately advance to the next level (such that level 30+ is more than just theoretically possible, and would not required the slaughter of 1,000,000+ goblins to achieve it). Wherever possible Epic quests will be carefully considered, challenging and tailored to your PC's storyline. As a result they may be delivered immediately or take quite a while, as there can be many interdependencies. (Including DM burnout!) Also it�s important that you actually have a story that can be progressed! If DMs feel your story is not sufficiently progressed you may need to do some preliminary work before receiving your quest. We really want epics to be EPIC!\n\nEpic Levels are defined as follows (with some examples to illustrate who might qualify at present for these classifications):\n\nLevels 21-22, 'Renowned': You are well known amongst those whose lives you have touched. In your hometown you are a local legend, and people view you as a pillar of the community. Either this, or they shudder at the mention of your name. Outside their walls few have heard of you, however. Examples include Tagnar, the upper echelon of the Arcane Alliance at their height, the Elite Black Eagle Forces (Master Assassins, Erebus Blackguards), Elite Ducal Forces (Knights of the Duchy, lesser Justicars).\n\nLevels 23-24, 'Famous/Infamous': Tales of your [mis]deeds are told throughout nearby lands. Few would know you to look on you, but the locals revere you and all you have done for them. Alternatively they shrink as you pass by, terrified of the horrible stories of your brutal nature. Examples include �The Six�, Justicar Dromilov.\n\nLevels 25-26, 'Hero/Arch-villain': You are feared or loved by all who have head your name, and feature prominently in the lore of Karameikos either as a force of righteousness or a power of evil. Examples include Baron Ludwig von Hendriks, Abraxus and Duke Stephan Karameikos.\n\nLevels 27-28, 'Legendary Hero/Legendary Villain': Your prowess and achievements are the stuff of legend, and your deeds shape the very evolution of the realms. Examples include Bargle, Mortimer and Grendel.\n\nLevels 29-36, 'Chosen': Fate has picked you as its champion, for good or for ill. Great deeds are done in your name, and you have brought change to the face of Mystara with your actions. Who knows what lies beyond? Examples are few, but might include Jherek and Archak.\n\nLevel 36+ 'Immortal': Examples include Alphaks, Cassanna, Halav, Hel, the Darq Lord.\n\nThe world's powerful NPCs will also be delevelled where necessary in accordance with these guidelines.\n\nIn each general Epic Class, there are a number of tiers, for instance, level 21 being minor renown and 22 being major renown.","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","Schedule":"Server runs 24/7, reset every 4 1/2 hours ","Treasure":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Number Servers":"One","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Alignments":"All alignments available and support through NPC reactions, scripting, and DM mediated shifts.

These pale skinned, white haired elves are called \"Shadow Elves\", and are a playable legacy with special restrictions and a different death and respawn system (reflecting the favour of their immortal). Most other elves are from Alfheim.","PVP":"Full PvP","ApplicationReqs":"No application required, but forum registration is strongly recommended (the forum is extremely active, with a total of 50,000+ posts in the last two years).","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Death and Respawn (see House rules for a full description of level-time restrictions)\n\nDying and respawning does not incur an XP penalty. You will never lose a level due to death. Instead, there is a physical impact (stats penalty) and recovery time (an increase in time till you can next level) effect of death. Item drops on death will remain unchanged.\n\nThe following table describes how many real-life days extra you will have to wait to achieve the next level, following a death. These wait times are cumulative across deaths (so if you died twice at level 5, you�d have an extra 2 days to wait until you were eligible to level up to 6, or an extra 3 days in total if you also respawned both time):\n\nLevel 1 = 0.5 days (Death) + 0 days (Respawn)\nLevel 2 = 0.5 days (Death) + 0 days (Respawn)\nLevel 3 = 0.5 days (Death) + 0.5 days (Respawn)\nLevel 4 = 1 day (Death) + 0.5 days (Respawn)\nLevel 5 = 1 day (Death) + 0.5 days (Respawn)\nLevel 6 = 1 day (Death) + 0.5 days (Respawn)\nLevel 7 = 1 day (Death) + 0.5 days (Respawn)\nLevel 8 = 1 day (Death) + 1 day (Respawn)\nLevel 9 = 1 day (Death) + 1 day (Respawn)\nLevel 10 = 2 days (Death) + 1 day (Respawn)\nLevel 11 = 2 days (Death) + 1 day (Respawn)\nLevel 12 = 2 days (Death) + 1 day (Respawn)\nLevel 13 = 2 days (Death) + 1 day (Respawn)\nLevel 14 = 2 days (Death) + 2 day (Respawn)\nLevel 15 = 2 days (Death) + 2 day (Respawn)\nLevel 16 = 3 days (Death) + 2 day (Respawn)\nLevel 17 = 3 days (Death) + 3 day (Respawn)\nLevel 18 = 3 days (Death) + 3 day (Respawn)\nLevel 19 = 4 days (Death) + 3 days (Respawn)\nLevel 20+ = 5 days (Death) + 4 days (Respawn)\n\nIn addition to the time-based penalty, your PC will be struck with a temporary penalty to some their abilitiy scores (e.g. STR, CON, INT etc.). The precise nature of the penalty will depend on your PCs class(es) but the magnitude of the reductions will be equal overall across the different classes. These ability score reductions cannot be removed by any means except time (i.e. rest and natural recovery, not dispel, greater restoration etc.). On further deaths, these penalties will accumulate, but will never result in any stat dropping to <3. These lingering after-effects of death will be gradually recovered over the next 1 and a half to 3 game months (= 1.5 to 3 real-life days). Having Raise Dead or Resurrection cast upon your PC will alleviate the above physical penalties somewhat (though not totally, with resurrection being better at reducing the ability score loss than raise dead), but will no affect on the leveling-time penalties, except that you will obviously not then have the respawn penalties applied.\n\nShadow Elves are the exception to the above death/respawn rules, taking no time- or stats-penalties on death (they instead burn up a Soul Crystal).","Connection":"100 Mbps","House rules":"Leveling rate\n\nHenceforth, there will be real-world time-limits (implemented via scripting) on the rate at which your PC can progress in level, as the following table explains:\n\nLevel 1 = 1 day (Cumulative = 1 day)\nLevel 2 = 2 days (Cumulative = 3 days)\nLevel 3 = 3 days (Cumulative = 6 days) = ~1 week\nLevel 4 = 4 days (Cumulative = 10 days)\nLevel 5 = 5 days (Cumulative = 15 days) = ~2 weeks\nLevel 6 = 5 days (Cumulative = 20 days)\nLevel 7 = 5 days (Cumulative = 25 days)\nLevel 8 = 5 days (Cumulative = 30 days) = ~1 month\nLevel 9 = 6 days (Cumulative = 36 days)\nLevel 10 = 6 days (Cumulative = 42 days)\nLevel 11 = 6 days (Cumulative = 48 days)\nLevel 12 = 7 days (Cumulative = 55 days)\nLevel 13 = 7 days (Cumulative = 62 days) = ~ 2 months\nLevel 14 = 7 days (Cumulative = 69 days)\nLevel 15 = 8 days (Cumulative = 77 days)\nLevel 16 = 8 days (Cumulative = 85 days)\nLevel 17 = 9 days (Cumulative = 94 days)\nLevel 18 = 9 days (Cumulative = 103 days)\nLevel 19 = 10 days (Cumulative = 113 days)\nLevel 20+ = 14 days (Cumulative = 127 days) = ~ 4 months\n\nNote: All of the real-life times discussed herein represent actual physical time passed, irrespective of how much or little time you spend in Mystara. For instance, one player could be on for 1 hour a day and another for 12 hours a day. Both would still be eligible to level up from level 4 to level 5 in 4 real-world days (96 hours).\n\nOf course, PCs must still also accumulate sufficient XP to progress through the levels � the above is an additional rather than alternative system of advancement. If a PC accumulates enough XP to be eligible to advance to the next level, yet has not spent sufficient time at their current level, they may continue to gain XP during this wait period up to a maximum of half-way to the the maximum of your current level. To avoid the annoying level up graphic masking your portrait once you have acquired your XP, you can go through the level up process. It will fail if you have not met the time requirement, but your current XP will be safely stored away, to be restored to the PC (up to a maximum of half-way to the maximum of your current level, as noted) when they have spent sufficient time at their current level. Let me illustrate using an example:\n\nExample 1: Ulrak the Bold achieves level 3 at 10pm on Monday 16th May. He will be eligible to level up to 4 in 3 real-life days hence, i.e. 10pm Thursday 19th May. However, by Wednesday 18th May he has achieved 10,000 XP, enough to level up to 4. He attempts to level up, and after completing the leveling up process (which he skips through rapidly, knowing the level will be immediately removed), he is set back to 6001 XP. Over the next day, he earns another 1200 XP, taking his running total to 7,201 XP and his actual XP count to 11,200 XP. At the appointed hour on the Thursday, he is able to level up to 4. He uses his level up widget (see below) to restore his XP, and levels up to 4. He will then qualify for level 5 when he has spent 4 days at level 4 and earned another 3,800 XP (which will take him to 15,000 XP).\n\nExample 2: If you were level 2, and gained 3,000 XP but had not spent sufficient time at level 2 to be eligible to level up, you'd be dropped back to level 2 at 1,001 XP, and then could gain a maximum of an additional 1,000 XP, to take your actual total to 4,000 XP. You'd get that extra 1,000 XP restored to you when you were eligible to level up (time-wise).\n\nWhat is this �level up widget�? It is a small item (looks like an eyeball and takes up one slot in your inventory) that you will acquire on entering the world after the update (once only � it is undroppable). Activation of this widget will tell you two pieces of information: (1) how much actual XP you have accumulated (e.g. Ulrak in the above example would have been told he actually had 11,200 XP rather than the 7,201 his character sheet had recorded); and (2) How long (in real life days) you have to wait until you are eligible to level up. In addition, if you are ready to level up, activating the widget will restore your stripped XP (so Ulrak would immediately jump from 7,201 XP to 11,200 XP, and he could then proceed to level up). However, the use of this widget is restricted to 1 use/game day (i.e. no more than once every 8 game hours [16 real-life minutes], refreshed after resting) � this is to prevent spamming it. The DMs have a new wand that permits them to increase or decrease the amount of time required to level as an RP award (or penalty), in addition to XP awards. It also allows them to examine individual players to see how much longer they require to level (or trigger their XP restoration), etc.\n\nLegacies that grant levels (i.e. Battle Training, Mercenary and Black Eagle legacies) will not be time restricted until they gain their pre-appointed level (e.g. Black Eagle troops will be able to immediately acquire level 2). Shadow Elves take double the above specified times to level up, but no longer require twice the XP of non-Shadow Elves. \n\nUnique Items\n\nBasically, there are also a couple of new systems for items in place, which have/will be imposed retrospectively on everyone's backpacks and in game therein after.\n\n- A \"custom\" item level restriction (ILR) has been imposed. This is totally independent and unrelated to Bioware's hardcoded system. It only affects some items, others are exempt. If you get a message to the effect of \"you cannot control the magical power of (item x)\", it means it has been flagged with an ILR (the value is not revealed), and you can't control it (use or activate it) at your current level of character development. You may when you've gained more power/experience.\n\n- A slew of items have now been flagged as \"PC Unique\". This means that only one copy of this class of items may be held by any given PC at one time - if you have, or attempt to collect/hold another copy, it will crumble into dust (but you'll still have one). These are still available in shops, so be careful with your purchases or you many find your newly purchased item crumble in your palm.\n\n- Some of the rarer/more powerful items have been flagged as \"Server Unique\". Only one copy may be present on the server at any one time. When you attempt to acquire such an item, there is a % chance of you successfully exerting your will over the item and dominating it. Thereafter, it will be yours, and yours alone, and anyone else currently in possession of one, or attempting to acquire one, will find it crumble into dust. If the item does not appear in anyone's inventory for a certain amount of time, then it will be assumed \"lost\" and be again up for grabs. It the first item does appear again at a later date, both objects will be permitted to remain in existence. These are NOT availabe from shops.\n\nThe application of the above new inventory rules is on the server-wide population, and not intended to be biased for/against anyone. The % chance of successfully dominating a Server Unique item is unrelated to your class/level/stats etc. The intention is that this system, in combination with the new levelling/death rules, will restore significant balance to the server,and provide a lot more interest in / respect for particular treasures. Owning a particular piece of valuable hardware will henceforth really mean something special. The above is an OOC explanation, but justifications should also be considered and dealt with IC.","Content Guide":"Everyone","Player Requirements":"* RP enforced server.

Our journey takes us onwards to the perilous realm of Dambrath, where your character will be able to pen his name into the scrolls of legend.\n\nAn extract from No place like Gnome. A Traveller's Guide to Dambrath by Trenip Follataffle \n\n...and I am sure you would not want to end like that. \n\nPenitence. Not a name that usually inspires hope or confidence. But after my recent travels, the embrace of this city is one both warm and welcome. On entering the main gate, one is assured by the sight of the guards that daily life here is quite different from the struggle for survival that takes place in much of the wilderness just so many metres behind you. On the common before the bridge leading out, a merchant hawks his wares, and people of all races gather to discuss the latest news. Truly, this is a world away from the much more hostile atmosphere in many other places in Dambrath.\n\nThose of you arriving at the city after your journey will no doubt be seeking some relaxation. Worry not, dear travellers, for the Inquistive Nose has already sniffed out the best place for your rest! Wander northwards to find a small secluded grove, containing both a monastery and the Blossom and Bosom Inn. With its friendly and hardworking staff, the B&B is the ideal place for any person to take a breather, whether it is the local smith, or a fortune-seeker from afar. With a decent selection of food and drink, and some clean rooms in which to rest, I award the B&B four out of five exploding fireworks.\n\nFurther into the city, one will soon stumble across the bustling tradesman's quarter. Here, crafts of all sorts are practised, perfected and the products sold on to both the local populace and constant stream of adventurers. Speaking of the local populace, most are very friendly and always willing to be stopped with a polite tap on the shoulder, to gossip about the latest news and rumours. Any traveller should know that word of mouth is the most common method from which to obtain information about new local hazards.\n\nFor the spiritually minded among us, the clergies of both Loviatar and Tymora have temples within the city. Respectively, they can be taken to represent both Penitence's history as a slave town, and the prosperity that sprung from the chance finding of electrum. But enough of history, for the traveller is always looking forward.\n\nOn heading north from the town, one must especially beware...\n\nNeed a reason to play?\n\nRealsphere: Nothing like this exists in any other NWN world, a truly unique system that brings Penitence to life. \n\nHeavy custom content: The Daggerford team prides itself on technical implementation of past worlds. Penitence takes this even further, with custom death systems, AI, NPC actions, the list goes on. \n\nPlayer driven world: Each player can help shape the world. We try to ensure every player is able to make an impact on the world. Let us craft you a story. \n\nThe Team and Community: Extremely strong and dedicated team and a community of like minded role-players.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"806":{"Title":"Aolyth","Author":"Numos","Submitted":20051008,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"CEP-1.52 Requires Community Expansion Project","Website":"ttp://www.snackbar-games.com/forums/index.php?c=21&\nsid=46a7d32ff15714be0a64f9b18e5a00a","Number Players":"35","Setting":"Aolyth takes place in a custom built world.","Number DMs":"6","IPs":"67.105.198.249:5121","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"There are no class restrictions, but primary casters can not excede 10th level.","Tricks & Traps":"Heavy","Level Range":"3-15","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Alignments":"All alignments are acceptible and given roleplay opportunity.","Experience Rewards":"Moderate to High","Races":"Over 10 subraces","PVP":"Party PvP","ApplicationReqs":"None.","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Aolyth uses the henchman always bleed to death system.","House rules":"Yes, see forum.","Content Guide":"Teen","RolePlay":"Heavy","Description":"Aolyth is a custom persistent world loosely based on a pnp campaign.

This is the Age of Dragons.\n\nDragons control the world. The nations that humans and elves will create do not exist yet, the lands instead ruled by oppressive dragons bent on enslaving the lesser races and by benevolent philosopher-kings dedicated to giving the non-dragons of the world safety and peace. Dragons share the control of the world, dividing it up into regions called suzerains, although they never truly agree on borders and territory. The good dragons vie for control using diplomacy and trade, while evil dragons at times wage all-out war on other suzerains and lesser territories, trying to subjugate or annihilate those who resist their cruel wishes.\n\nNon-dragons are only beginning to rise from barbarism. Many of the races that will in time become dominant in the world have just begun to feel their abilities and potential grow. Humankind is the most barbaric, still in the throes of a violent and destructive nature. Elves and dwarves have begun to develop some technology, but items commonplace in the future are the exception, not the norm. Metal weapons and armor are somewhat rare, and the intricacies of magic are still being discovered and developed by non-dragons. Coins as currency do not exist, with small gems being used in place of barter in some places, and bars of gold and silver the norm for large transactions. Sailing ships are still in their infancy and never seen in groups, and land-based transport such as carts and wagons are only for the wealthy and the powerful. Survival is the most important thing on the minds of the common folk, be it the slaves of an oppressive red dragon or the citizens of a forest controlled by a benevolent silver dragon.\n\nMagic is fantastic and uncommon. Even though dragons wield great magics and command the forces of the arcane, the secrets of the arcanum are just that � secrets, wielded by few non-dragons, save the most studious, pious, or commanding of the lesser races. The magic shops and wizard schools of the original Talernon setting do not exist, and rituals are a valued and coveted commodity. Most common folk might only see magic a few times in their life, save when wielded by dragons or their servants, the dragonborn. Miracles of magic sometimes are found in the most dedicated of the servants of the gods, but even these actions are considerably rarer than in the original Talernon campaign, with a village healer wielding considerable influence and a wizard in a remote tower the subject of rumor and fear.\n\nThe planar structure of the multiverse is undeveloped. Unlike the original Talernon setting, the cosmos has a very different structure.

The dialogues and characters of Gemriver are perhaps the best fleshed out and most fun anywhere I've seen.\n- The City of Sidon: Ruled under the Iron Fist of the CHurch of Malefar, Sidon presents a lot of opportunity.

It also has a lot of rules, like no bared weapons in the city, no breaking and entering, and stiff jail sentences and fines for lawbreakers. \n- Griffin's Tail: A new, fledgling city borne off the South Bay.

Nervously, his horse under him snorted and stepped sideways. Why had he listened to all those ghost stories about the fogs of Mordent? Cursing the damp fog he carefully withdrew his flintlock pistol from its place at his waist and checked that the powder had remained dry. It would have to do. Again he scanned the fog now encircling him. His horses flanks were twitching now, and a sweat started to rise from his well trained mount. \n\nOver there to the right of the road, a silhouette of darker grey against the lighter fog. Had it not been midday he would never have seen it. Immediately he dug his heels into his mount, it reared and charged forward. A low moan went up from the thing in the fog. As steady as he could from his speeding mount he leveled his pistol and fired at the thing as he passed within ten feet of it. In a few moments more he was riding up out of the bank of fog, and into the next along the road. A smile crossed his face as any 'thing' would be hard pressed to catch him while he was mounted on such a fine horse. A branch slapping his face brought him out of his relief. He was off the road! The horse stumbled and cried pitifully, Edmund was flung from his saddle, luckily not breaking his neck as he landed. \n\nEdmund shook his head to regain his senses and felt around like a blind man in the fog for his pistol. Instead his hand came upon his mount, whose foreleg was sitting at an unnatural angle. The horses eyes wide with fear and pain stared at him accusingly. At that moment as the fog lifted a little, he saw two translucent arms close around him from behind. An icy burn of two lips on the nape of his neck. And Edmund was no more....\n\nRavenloft - Domains of Dread. \nRelease Date: Halloween 31/10/2005. \nWeb Site: http://www.aussienwn.com/\n\nA roleplaying server using NeverWinterNights, to combine D&D 3.5 and the Ravenloft Setting as faithfully as possible.

The Ten Towns region has been populated for some time now and is mostly comprised of humans, dwarves, and barbarians. Half-elves and a handful of other races are in the minority, though in recent years several elven families have found their way into the towns as well. There are usually two reasons anyone comes to the Ten Towns area: To fish the lakes the towns and become scrimshanders, or for various reasons, make themselves disappear as far as the rest of Faerun is concerned. \n\nTen Towns is north of the savage frontier and west of the spine of the world. It is located in the cold harsh lands of icewind dale where one of Auril's priestesses, angered because of the warming of the environment caused by the activities and pollution from the ten towns tries to freeze the land over and make it ice forever. As a result, the winters are long and bitter and the summers growing colder and a bit shorter with each passing year. \n\nThis PW is aiming to give players the chance to become leaders of towns and aid in the building of them via income earned. You will start in the small town of Lonelywood and from there it's up to you what your character sets out to achieve, be it a leader of towns, a hired killer, or the hero who saves us all from Auril's icy grip. The choice is yours to make. \n\nREQ Files: CEP, Cep companion, City Rural Forest snow tileset ","Rating":9,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"826":{"Title":"The Stormlands","Author":"Blake Ryan","Submitted":20051105,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Dungeon Adventure","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"ttp://www.geocities.com/blake_de_ryan/Stormlands.htm","Number Players":"1-32","Setting":"Custom World, Dark ages fantasy with medium level crime/magic.","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All NWN+SOU+HOTU","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"1-40","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Moderate","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"Any.","Experience Rewards":"Moderate","Races":"See webpage for details.","PVP":"Party PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Lose some Xp and Gp.","House rules":"Abuse of other players is not tolerated.","Content Guide":"Mature","RolePlay":"Light","Description":"Fantasy world for 1st-40th level characters.

The world is open to anyone wishing to adventure in a high quality persistent world. No haks, no password, and no application or secret handshake are required - just a measure of maturity and a sense of fair play.\n\n'Origins' is about a world emerging from the ashes of war. People are escaping from servitude and returning from exile to rebuild, rediscover, and reclaim that which was lost during the ruinous reign of an unpopular king. However, his hired humanoid hordes still lurk about, making travel between civilized centers perilous. Rumors speak of a new power recently unleashed, though it's not known if this be a force for good or evil.\n\n'Origins'provides many novel features to enhance your role-playing experience. Most classes possess custom abilities and powers including the assassin's mark, druidic springwell, ranger tracking, wizard rift staff, and bardic lore. Our ambition is to make every class, race, and alignment balanced but viable. \n\nPlayers can join exclusive player-run guilds/strongholds/societies - or found a new one and seek followers. Each guild has its own base and benefits available only to members - item storage, free rest, a PC prison, altar, merchants, healers, guards, portals, etc. \n\nDiscover and worship a deity of your choice and gain special abilities as you advance in power - or remain an unfettered heathen and dispense with divine blessing, holy symbols, and (*blech*) tithes. \n\nAlign yourself with one of the six factions at odds in the world and work your way up through their ranks. Enlist in the Royalist army, fight for the Freehold peasantry, follow the Knights of the Radiant Heart, join a bandit gang, defend the fey folk, become a mercenary in the service of a feudal lord - or remain an independent adventurer and fight them all! \n\nA custom crafting system allows you to add magical properties to your choosen weapon, armor, and equipment without wasting hours of precious playing time. With the right attention, the same simple short sword you started with can evolve into the most legendary, loathesome, back-stabbing blade in existence!\n\n'Origins' is designed to facilitate and encourage party vs party, competitive role play.

Il se d�marque du bouchon original par son univers qui se base sur celui des Royaumes Oubli�s. Cependant l'action se situe dans un plan d'existence dont les portes se trouveraient aux abords de la mer de lune, un secret bien gard�. L'Univers utilise donc le panth�on des Royaumes Oubli�s et l'histoire qui va avec. Et vos persos y rencontreront des personnalit�s des Royaumes Oubli�s ou des organisations enti�res.\nIl est possible d'incarner � peu pr�s toutes les positions sociales possibles, au niveau hi�rarchique. Ce qui implique un minimum d'investissement et de pr�sence sur le forum et le serveur de jeu.\nLe joueur peut jouer les races classiques, mais aussi des races dites \"exotiques\" comme les Elfes Noirs, Vampire, Personne atteinte de Lycanthropie, Demi-Dragon, ... Mise � part les Elfes Noirs (Drows), les autres races ne sont jouables qu'apr�s validation des DMs. Les Races exotiques sont g�r� automatiquement via de nombreux scripts propre � Gamerezo et souvent unique. Les Lycanthropes se transformant automatiquement en Garou � la pleine lune, l'aveuglement des races de l'ombreterre ainsi que leur r�sistance magique. Beaucoup de param�tres sont rendu plus coh�rent gr�ce � l'utilisation de script sp�cifique cr�e par l'�quipe de conception de Gamerezo.\n\n\nExemple, de param�tres plus globaux qui rendent le jeu plus int�ressant :\n- Un syst�me g�rent l'Agonie de votre personnage, quand il passe de vie � tr�pas, lorsqu'il passe en dessous de 0 point de vie, votre personnage n'est pas mort conform�ment au r�gle d'D&D3, cependant comme il bless�, votre personnage poss�de un certains pourcentage de chance que son m�tabolisme arrive � le maintenir en vie jusqu'a qu'il re�oive des soins, pourcentage en fonction de la constitution / et autres param�tres de votre personnage.\n- Les dieux �tant tr�s important, les pr�tres peuvent se voir d�chu pour un temps de tout pouvoir, en fonction des actions qu'ils m�nent, et les r�cup�rent � l'issu d'une qu�te qui peut �tre destin� � cet effet.\nSi vous d�sirez cr�er un personnage qui n'est pas pr�tre mais qui le devienne, c'est possible, car chacun des Grands Pr�tres(ses) des temples proposent de rejoindre leur culteaux aux personnes qu'ils(elles) jugent aptes � le faire.\n- Le syst�me de la mort est g�r� diff�remment quant � lui. Quand votre personnage meurt, son corps reste � terre, jusqu'a ce qu'un pr�tre le ressuscite/rappel � la vie, ou encore qu'un compagnon d'arme transporte son corps via une panoplie de script qui permet de le faire, jusque dans un temple ou dans un endroit moins dangereux o� il serait susceptible d'�tre soign�. Si par maleur votre personnage se retrouve dig�r� par un Dragon, que vous �tes all�s voir en d�couvrant le module, il vous reste toujours la possibilit� d'appuyer sur le bouton RESPAWN, bouton qui ne s'affiche qu'une minute apr�s la mort de tout personnage, cette attente, a pour but d'�viter un respawn \"d'inattention\" apr�s un PK ou autre mort, qui pourrait g�cher le RolePlay de nombreuses personnes qui s'adonnaient peut �tre � une traque. Quand vous utilisez le bouton Respawn, il vous envoie dans un autre plan sous une autre forme. Vous redevenez ce que vous �tiez au d�but : une �me cherchant sa voie. Il vous est possible � ce stade de rejoindre plusieurs PLANS dans lesquelles les Dieux r�sident. De cette mani�re vous pouvez choisir un dieu � v�n�rer par ce biais ou m�me encore poursuivre votre RolePlay dans la mort, mais ce royaume est contraint par d'autre r�gles, celle de la m�moire, tout ce qui s'y passe n'est pas connu par votre personnage � son retour dans le Plan primaire, c'est � dire qu'il ne se souvient plus de tout ce qui attrait � sa mort et perd par cons�quent les fameux points d'exp�riences ainsi que des pertes mat�rielles comme des pi�ces d'or.\nIl se peut, � de rares occasions, qu'un dieu souhaite que vous vous souveniez d'un �l�ment en particulier, d'une qu�te dont il vous aurait charg� sp�cialement.\n-Diff�rentes Langues peuvent �tre parl�s sur le module, une douzaine en tout, en passant de l'elfique au language C�leste, en repassant par les profondeurs du Drows, etc. Ce syst�me permet de parler dans une langue qui ne peut �tre compris que par ceux qui la parle. Et accrois dans ce sens les possibilit�s de Roleplay.\n\nA noter �galement que cet univers � sa g�ographie propre, ce qui implique aussi, une ambiance propre, et une trame propre, une histoire propre. Il y a plusieurs villes, plusieurs guildes, plusieurs cultes pr�sents, beaucoup de choses les lient entre eux. Des intrigues sont pr�sentes, les joueurs seuls comme avec les MDs participent � faire avancer l'histoire globale, de deux fa�ons en s'impliquant activement au coeur de l'intrigue ou en ayant un r�le plus secondaire mais important au sein de cette derni�re.\nCertains PNJ (NPC, Personnage Non Joueur) ont une Intelligence Artificielle Accrue, dans le sens o� leur comportement varierait avec vos agissements, ce qui inclue leur d�placement ainsi que leur fa�on d'�tre (habits, fa�on de s'exprimer).\n\nLes DMs sont � votre �coute, n'h�sitez pas � les contacter.\nLes id�es/travaux propos�s par les joueurs, seront bien entendu �tudi� puis adapt�/int�gr� aux modules dans les limites des r�gles impos�es par l'univers. Tout est possible tant que la coh�rence suit.\nVous pouvez leur transmettre un background, qui en fonction de votre inspiration lors de l'�criture et celle de l'�quipe d'Animation pendant la lecture, pourra donner lieu � des anims sp�cifiques. Il se peut que l'�quipe d'Animation confie un r�le sp�cial � un joueur en particulier qui devra mener un personnage hors normes pour accomplir une qu�te qui visent � changer un point important dans le module du serveur, tout en suivant une certaine ligne de conduite impos� par le Type de personnage qu'il joue. Sa pr�sence sera bien souvent inconnu et peut �tre � l'origine de nombreuses Animations.\n\nEn dehors des �normes trames et animations de grande envergure aux cons�quences profondes, des animations plus courtes et moins profondes, sont mise en places par les joueurs et l'�quipe d'animation qui n'h�siteront pas � propos� dans les lieux appropri�s des Tournois de toute sortes, comme des concours d'Archerie, de Boissons, de Combats en Ar�ne, d'Enigme. Il se peut qu'une partie seulement du serveur soit concern� par une Animation, pendant que l'autre partie \"vie\" normalement en prenant ou non connaissance d'un �v�nement important mais pas vital (selon la philosophie de votre personnage).\n\nL'Equipe d'Animation et de Conception se tient naturellement � l'�coute des joueurs pour toute remarque et conception. L'utilisation du forum RP est tr�s int�ressante pour rendre compte des faits pass� dans l'univers. Et offrent aux autres, une fa�on de se repr�senter certaines actions via leurs �crits, �crits qui peuvent �tre r�compens�s dans le jeu.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"834":{"Title":"Merliconor","Author":"Revoleon and Merliconor Team","Submitted":20051111,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"ttp://merliconor.proboards60.co","Description":"It's similar to a Harry Potter style world in many prospectives, it's mystical and based on magic.

Nearly 200 new Markshire specific recipes including stitched padded armors, specialty bows and crossbows, mithral weapons, CEP weapons, hoods, wooden and new metal shields, amulets, musical instruments and classic Nordic foods and new Markshire specific foods.\n\n*****************\n\nDescription: Markshire: Kingdom of Ice is a new Persistent World situated in a realm of Norse background merged with medieval feudalism. The country known as Markshire has seen many hardships over the years but her heroes strive to hold back the tides of Chaos. \n\nWe have over 400 areas built with a fine eye towards details and storytelling. Our goal is to provide a sanctuary for roleplayers who wish to embrace a story many years in the making. Our corps of players and DMs are old school PnP players who have endeavored to capture the feel of classic PnP within this modern video game.\n\nUnique Scripted Systems are the backbone of this world where endless possibilities are found and the road less traveled is never the same twice. Some of our proud achievements: (links to published systems are below)\nCAMPSITE REST SYSTEM: Finally a rest system that allows the PCs to rest within the scope of Roleplay. Be it indoors or out this system is built to animate the PC in one of 5 different ways for their rest. Plop down on your backside and zonk out or fall on your face after a tough battle and the other options bring a mundane need into the realm of imagination.\nNEW 1/24/06 - PERSISTENT CHEST SYSTEM: Persistence is the key to a continued experience on any world. Storage of items outside of your personal inventory there is little to do using the basic game. So utilizing a simple single command I have built a system that allows many options not normally found in Persistent Item Storage.\nNEW 2/17/06 - EXPERIENCE AWARD SYSTEM: The system is designed to promote teamwork (AKA parties) and to better reflect your actual experiences in combat. The system utilizes a new formula that is modified from the PnP base.\nNEW 5/22/06 - NOMENCLATURE: Monsters have always worn the name tags defining them so the DMs could choose appropriate monsters from the Creator. Well, now OnSpawn they rename themselves to a more generic name. Perhaps though, certain NPCs just need random names ... no problem ... the system handles those as well.\nNEW 6/30/06 - RANDOM MERCHANT SYSTEM: Tired of visiting a merchant and wondering if the builders might have added something new today? So are we. This new system was built specifically for Markshire and allows the individual merchants to have daily changing inventories. The system utilizes tables of merchandise that are randomly spawned on the merchant at module load. So today the Fur Merchant has several badger skins, a series of different feline skins and the ever so illusive dire bear skin. Across the street another merchant is hawking his wares and has a variety of various alchemical equipment and ingredients for sale. Each merchant also has random Buy/Sell rates to simulate market fluctuations. Today he sells that healing kit +1 for one price, tomorrow he's nearly out and decides to get something extra for his now rare items. We combine this with our Random Encounter System's latest addition mentioned below.\n UPDATED 6/30/06 - RANDOM ENCOUNTER SYSTEM: Designed and Built specifically for Markshire, this system brings back the Random Encounter Tables of the older editions of Dungeons & Dragons and puts them to good use in NWN. Any area on the server can now spawn a random encounter that draws from a series of tables and place them randomly in the area in a group or spread out. No two trips into our Narlynwik Forest will ever truly be the same. In addition to the method explained above we now have two other methods of random encounter generation. For more details on this incredible system please visit our Scripts In Use section.\n\nThe first is our Denizen system. The Denizen option allows us to populate the city streets with NPCs who congregate, wander from stall to stall or simply stand about. Basically, breathing life into an area.\n The second system allows us to populate an area with multiple BUT unique creatures. The No Two Alike option can be used to simulate changing marketplaces (having two of Bob the Smoked Meat salesman would be odd) and other similar situations. Instead of comparing the spawning creature to those already created which is a lengthy looping method, this system randomly chooses a unique precrafted order to spawn possible creatures.\n NEW 7/28/06 - MARKSHIRE FISHING SYSTEM: Some of the players suggested including a fishing system and since the ones available on the vault all require a hakpak we decided to create our own. The system is fairly easy to use ... situated near water at various locations across Markshire are fishing spots (Tamurin River is covered with them) that show up as blue clickable transitions. Equip a fishing pole, available from General Store merchants in game, click on the fishing spot and then sit and wait. Patiently. Because if you move you won't catch anything. At the end of the cycle you'll be notified about your success or failure.\n We've incorporated and customized for our world quite a few NW Vault script systems as well:\n Awol's Fireworks Demetrious,OldManWhistler & IntrepidCW's Henchmen Always Bleed to Death Deva Bryson Winblood's Frostbite Dez's Modified Respawn & Afterlife System DMFI's DM Wand Package Festyx & Hrnac's Craftable Natural Resources (CNR) Lex's Another Pack Ox Lion's Hold's Library Book Drop Markshire's Magic Carpet Transitions Markshire's Quill of PC Recording Rocc's Subdual Damage Silicon Scouts' Treasure Spawn System \nOur Operating Guidelines:\nRelatively Low-Medium Magic\n Maintained DM to Player ratio\nWith over 400 areas to explore you can be assured of finding something\n interesting. Some of the more intriguing places to visit are:\nThrym Pass and Gastlinyk Gate - A dangerous mountain pass that leads to the frontier fortress/city of Gastlinyk Gate. The city is named for the infamous Mad Red Titan, Gastlinyk and his dimensional prison that looms over the city itself from the mountain cliffs above.\n The Timeless Desert - These frozen wastes are patrolled by Frost Giants and serves as home to a variety of monsters (many custom).\n The Great Narlynwik Forest - Covering a huge portion of the country, the forest is filled with magical wonders and deadly tribes of orcs.\n Stonemark - An incredible city that stands untouched so far by war.

In the world of Raeth the sole continent of the world was split ages ago into 4 seperate continents. Each of these continents mirrors 1 of the 4 elements. \n\nThe 1st PW up will focus on the continent of Eirilon. Eirilon is the Continent of Earth, It is home to the more Earth based Races. Races of the woods and mountains. Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Halflings... the majority of the basic races of NWN. As well as Dryads, and other woodland creatures are abundant on Eirilon. The once peaceful continent is now under constant siege from invaders from the continent of Sarkhet (Fire). This provides the initial drive for adventure in the game as well as exploration of the many ancient ruins to further the power of the players \"Elementsl Scars\".\n\n\"Elemental Scars\" are one of the notable additions on this server. Players represent a small minority of creatures in the world of Raeth, and they all carry \"Elemental Scars\" these are crystal formations that form lightly on the skin, which provide magical powers. Each player starts with 1 of the many elemental scars and can complete quests to help it grow in power. Each elemental scar will have several levels. \n\nAnother Notable feature is what i call the path system. This will drive the storyline each player recieves, an will drive the endgame content for each player as well as their \"ending\". The Server is basically divided into Chapters, Chapter 1 has 3 possible outcomes, based on decisions the play makes at the beginning of the game. Each chapter will then open up to at least 2 paths to continue on. NPC's will react differently to players on different paths, this will allow many different ways for players to play the game and will allow players to play the game several times through and get a different story each time. Chaper 1 Should Take a character from level 3-10, chapter 2 should take him from 10-20, and so on. By the end of chapter 5 i Expect about 10 possible outcomes for the players and probably 3 exclusive end bosses as well as a few not exclusive endgame bosses. \n\nI hope for this server to provde lots of entertainment for all types of players. NPC's wil respond to skills, Dungeons and treasure chests will contain traps, and there will be plenty to fight and lots of powerful items to find. So both Roleplayers and Hack and Slash players should feel at home most of the time. only people who might not like it are the hardcore fanatics, but i always found all those rules too tedious...\n\nWell thats about it, the server is still in Development, but i hope to have the PW up with Chapter 1 by the end of the year. I also plan on making the NWN2 jump when it comes, and the server will go with me to the upgraded client.\n\nHope u all enjoy.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"848":{"Title":"Moonsea Chronicles","Author":"Moonsea Chronicles Community","Submitted":20051202,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"ttp://zhentilkeep.gotf.ne","Number Players":"max 40","Setting":"Forgotten Realms \n","Number DMs":"10","IPs":"217.64.127.104:5121","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All, Players Ressources Compendium included.","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"3 to 40","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Schedule":"24/7/365 Forever!","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Alignments":"We offer RP for all alignments.","Races":"All, including PrC's subraces.","PVP":"Party PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Deity Respawn System : You are asked to choose a patron deity on first log in.

Even if you complete one quest you are still allowed to go back and play it again, though it may not be as fun.\n\nIt is supposed to feel like a real PnP RPG. The Gamemaster will give you a mission and you will play it. As stated earlier, on the completion of each quest you will earn another token to play a harder mission.

Lovecraft, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Anne Rice's Interview with a Vampire etc. The world may easily appear gloomy to people more familiar with high fantasy, but also having a strong sense of mystery rather than the bland and obvious.\n\nMainly, our aspiration is to have an atmosphere that's immersing, with stories that reaches out to the players as they partake in making them, for a rich and vivid roleplay experience.\n\nIn that sense, don't let being unfamiliar with the setting discourage you. We don't strive to be different from others simply by bringing the Ravenloft setting to the list of NwN PWs, and we won't test you in Ravenloft trivia or expect you to read books before joining the server. Our primary goal - our outset - is to create a place where roleplay, in all its forms, thrives.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nSome might already worry that we are dedicated to ultra-realism: micro-management of every movement, no chance of adventure and achievement, every character sitting safe behind locked and barred doors, trembling in fear of what may be going on outside.\n\nThis is not what we aim for.\n\nWhat we want to give you is the opportunity. Something you can shape yourself and with others. The opportunity to roleplay in as many situations as possible in as much detail as you desire. We want the world to react in a manner that inspires and encourages you to roleplay. We will not rigidly force you into roleplaying in certain ways, as we believe that forced roleplay never is good roleplay, and won't serve anyone. We want to have faith in your ability to roleplay too, and encourage you to think creatively.\n\nThis doesn't mean that we'll tear down every 3rd edition rule to replace with anarchy. Balance is needed, because risk is needed for progress to make sense. We may even choose to do things to adjust this balance better, as long as it isn't at the expense of the roleplay. But When we do change things, it's always ultimately for the sake of roleplay.\n\nWhat you really should expect is a NWN experience that to a much lesser degree rely on out of character mechanics disrupting your roleplay, and instead, more in-character mechanics that further it, providing meaningful material for it. We aren't primarily focused on whether the way you explore the world is true to real life, as much as to try to make the world you explore alive. We want to give you a better opportunity to act in character, so we want the world to act better in character. We want the world to roleplay too.\n\n-------\n\nDOWNLOADS\n\nNotice that we are using the CEP 2.4a, so make sure to download that prior to entering the world.

","Content Guide":"Teen","Player Requirements":"Polite and mature player-base.","RolePlay":"Heavy","Description":"Escaped from Undeath: Mistlocke\n\nThe EFU franchise has successfully moved on to chapter 3, \"Escape from Undeath: Mistlocke.\" \n\nDescribing EFU:M is difficult to do, except to say that it is a labor of love designed for those interested in an action-packed, meaningful, cooperative story-telling environment. \n\nIf you've tried EFU (Escape from the Underdark) or EFU:A (Escaped from the UnderdarK: Archipelago) in the past, we encourage you come and try out EFU:M, as we have made a wide variety of improvements.\n\nOur website has now been updated and contains relevant information on the Setting and the many features we offer, and we highly suggest that if you may be interested in a project of this kind, that you review it thoroughly.\n\nAlthough our playerbase is large, we are extremely motivated and interested in welcoming new players to our world.\n\nPlease note - due to the IMMENSE changes this server has gone through, the associated review is not really valid anymore.\n\nWe highly recommend visiting Link for more info on this server. Below is an incomplete list of what we have to offer.\n\nScripted Quests\nThe primary means of XP gain in EfU is through cooperatively tackling any of our hundreds of unique scripted quests. Wandering through areas and mindlessly farming monsters is not an efficient way to advance or level.\nInstead, characters can band together to cooperatively tackle challenges: anything from storming well defended fortresses and castles, delving into mysterious crypts, doing battle with hideous jungle beasts, defending a point from ravenous hordes of zombies, or rescuing hostages. Our quests are generally fully repeatable, setting-appropriate, artfully designed, and often \"spiced\" or adjusted by DMs on the fly.\n\nLore\nConsiderable effort has gone towards ensuring that the setting and history of EFU/EFUA is fully developed and compelling. There are in-game stores that sell dozens of extensive books discussing histories and various theories as to some of the mysteries of the EFU/EFUA/EFUM setting.\nWhile taking advantage of the Forgotten Realms setting, we've developed non-canon regions and details that incorporate themes and characteristics from some of our favorite works of fiction, including: Lovecraft, George R. R. Martin, Robert Howard, Tolkien, Kafka, the Wachowski brothers, Mieville, and others -- as well as some from popular Black Isles Titles such Planescape: Torment, Fallout 1 and 2 and Baldur's Gate.\n\nMetaplots\nDMs are not just referees and builders, but also story-tellers. Metaplots are a major part of the EFUA experience. In the past, examples of major plots include: plagues, rebellion, invasion, the acquiring of important magical relics, political crisis, vampires, gang wars, and much more.\n\nCharacter Conflicts\nA major part of EFU has traditionally been that of the role-played conflict that occurs between characters. Examples of this might be: a thief running from the Watch, the consuming hatred between two rival wizards, a subtle war between merchants, bloody conflict between gangs, a Kelemvorite hunting down a necromancer, a paladin dueling a blackguard, a politician scheming against an opponent, or countless other examples.\n\n \nIn EfU, this conflict is resolved by characters through their RP. We do not encourage mindless PvP, but rather an environment that resembles the best of fantasy fiction and cinema. Just as with fiction, there is meaningful conflict between characters. Unlike fiction, there is no set-winner, and the victorious are separated by the defeated through what they do In-Character (sometimes this might be straight PvP, in other cases it will be who out-schemed, out-thought, out-planned, or out-tricked the other).\n\nDM Quests\nThe DM team regularly runs DM quests and DM events. Sometimes these will be planned and advertised on our forums, sometimes they will be spur-of-the-moment or secret. DM quests could just be a simple event to kill some monsters and earn some special DM loot, or they could relate to a complicated faction rivalry or metaplot.\n\nDM Team\nThe EFUA DM team tries to be highly responsive to the needs of players. We work hard to make ourselves available for NPC possessions and assist with a character's goals or needs, as well as being capable and fair administrators and referees. It is worth noting that we hold ourselves as a team to a very high standard of conduct in terms of not being biased, of not punishing characters for OOC reasons, of not cheating in any way, and of not having any kind of advantage when and if we play as a normal character.\n\nExploration\nExploration is a major part of EFUA. Characters will receive a one-time XP bonus for entering certain areas, and we've tried very hard to make a server that is fun, challenging, and rewarding to explore.\n\n\n\nModule Updates\nTens of thousands of man-hours has gone into building EfU, and much of this has simply been updating the module to reflect the changes that have happened (often through the efforts of characters). Factions rise and fall, NPCs die, districts are invaded or built, buildings are burnt down, and the world is constantly evolving and changing - all of which is updated in a timely manner by the DM staff. \n","Rating":9.96,"Votes":60,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"869":{"Title":"World of Isandor - Xenograft Arms","Author":"Chass","Submitted":20060117,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires SoU & CEP","Website":"ttp://isandor.servegame.co","Number Players":"32","Setting":"Free-form Setting ","Number DMs":"3","IPs":"isandor.servegame.com:5122","Scope":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Dependant on Module","Tricks & Traps":"Dependant on Module","Level Range":"Level Ranges from 1-10 ","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Schedule":"24/7","Treasure":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Number Servers":"2","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Player's efforts","PVP":"Mixed","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Permanent Death","Connection":"DSL","House rules":"Keep In Character at all cost.","Content Guide":"Mature","Player Requirements":"Roleplaying Experience a Plus","RolePlay":"Heavy","Forums":"Link","Description":"World of Isandor, Xenograft Arms is a Fantasy-Modern Adventure Persistent Realm set in a freeform environment based on our successful pre-existing realm.

They are off the Sword Coast, in between and to the West of Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep. They will not be found in the books as they are a creation of our own.\n\nThe main cities are Fistra, Azure, Rune and the Northern Fort, there have been others in the past though most no longer stand. All the cities remain separate except the Northern Fort which falls under the jurisdiction of Fistra. Despite this, the entire island falls under the jurisdiction of the King who resides in Fistra. The king retains relationships with most nearby nations and keeps on good terms with all those they interact with. While all the cities are technically under his rule, they are not completely united and some are even rivals.\n\nFistra is your average fantasy city. There is a mayor who governs the main city. The main city is a trade city with many shops and merchants. Adventurers flock to here for it seems to be prone to danger. Quite a few years ago a large attack by forces of evil destroyed the above ground city and forced the citizens underground. They have since rebuilt and now reside both above and below. The city retains good terms with Rune and the Northern Fort as well as shaky terms with Azure, its sister city.\n\nAzure is the dark sister city to Fistra. It is ruled largely by the temple of Bane that is there and there is little the island government can do against it to stop it. It is however contained to the city. Azure is a place of dark trading and behind the scenes work for many. It is said that behind it all is a woman known only as Mistress Jade but few have ever seen her. The city is corrupt and dirty but for many they find it a more appealing home then Fistra.\n\nRune is the desert land on a nearby island. It is ruled by an order of monks, known as the Monks of Rune. They are an order dedicated to neutrality in all matters no matter what and do not act unless forced to. They're lands are dominated by fierce beasts and lack of water and only the bravest and most foolhardy journey there.\n\nThe Northern Fort has only just in the recent years expanded to the size of a small fort. It is mainly a foothold in the snowy northern lands of the island and is blocked by mountains so the only access is by ship. The warriors who live in the fort battle constantly to keep the small foothold from the hoards of creatures that live in those lands. It is a place where many freeze to death or worse amid some of the harshest conditions and creatures the world has to offer.\n\nAmong the surrounding lands are the ruined cities of Fallon which has only recently been uncovered and Dread city, as the residents now call it. Fallon was a town destroyed in a dragon attack and sunk into the seas. No one knows the dragon's motivation but it has recently come above sea level and people speak of creatures of true power roaming it. The original name of Dread City has been forgotten to time, its current name was earned by the sheer numbers of undead that rule the streets of the city. It is not a place for people who scare easily or die easily.\n\nOther lands can be found about and many more stories can be learned through listening. \n\n\n\nAlurodia is receiving weekly updates from it's builders. Current head builder is Black Feather. She has rp experience spanning 30 years since Dungeons and Dragons was born. Other building comes from Achi and from Tezcatlipoca who has world design experience spanning over 20 years. There had been many things needing correcting for this module has been around for years--but it is gaining attention.\n\nPart of the attention is from a more complete dm staff.

For those of you that find your path heading north, seeking out adventure, do not miss seeing one of the wonders on the journey the Moonbridge. This famous span connects the New City with the rest of Silverymoon. It is composed entirely of magical energy akin to a wall of force, and is similarly indestructible. The bridge is almost completely invisible by day, but at night it shimmers with a silvery translucence under the light of the moon. What will you discover, what will happen to these brave adventurers, and how will it effect their lives in Silverymoon?\n\nANYONE is welcome to play in Luruar at any time as it is a PUBLIC PW Server. We are always looking for new and good players, that enjoy a fun time and respects others rights to the same, so feel free to join us. With over 520 areas and growing there is enough room for all.

Thus, infuriating the dragons.\n\n3 BIS - Third Age: The dragons, angered by these invading humans, began to ransack and pillage the smaller settlements and villages, causing fear and chaos to spread. slowly, the humans crept into the walls of their kingsoms, hiding from the original rulers. For many years, the humans slowed their expansion.\n\n4 IS - Fourth Age: After a rather horrible incident involving a flight of dragons and the castle of a king, the humans began to build up their forces, forge weapons, erect fortresses and start small armies. The humans had enough, and began to fight back. Thus, the War of Ice and Steel began.\n\n5 IS - Fifth Age: The humans suffered many defeats, as did the ice dragons, though they still held the upper hand. For almost seven years blood was spilt, and no progress was made. Then a woman stepped forth and took the scattered and unaligned armies and unified them under one banner. Ariel Starhunter began her crusade against the dragons, and soon starting to take the upper hand, dominating most of the lands and holding them from the dragons. Finally, there was hope for the humans.\n\n6 IS - Sixth Age: Tragedy struck the unified armies in the form of Ariel's death. She was poisoned by none other than her own lieutenant, Char Malice. A powerful leader of the Howling Flame cult, him and his followers soon broke off from the nation and bagan their own war. But this one on ALL of Wintresia. This angered the soldiers of the Unified Nations, and they fought furiously with the Howling Flame and dragons. The dragons now near extiction, started to breed with captured humans, to spread their seed in hybrids to keep their blood line alive. \n\n7 AIS - Seventh Age: Char, now ascended to dietieship, has been scorned by the true gods of Wintresia. He continues his war on the lands of Wintresia.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"909":{"Title":"Noctar's Noble Realm","Author":"Phylia","Submitted":20060408,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Epic","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.66","Website":"octarsrealm.proboards31.co","Number Players":"45","Setting":"Nordock","Number DMs":"6\n3 DMs\n3 GMs","IPs":"69.171.157.0\n","Staff Requirements":"Extensive knowledge of the Nordock Module, scripting capabilities, strong RP abilities, a Guest-first attitude, Understanding basic D&D","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Dependant on Module","Classes":"Any and all are welcome.

Alain Fantasia knew this, and therefore, commenced an unimaginable feat. Such a project was a secret even to his brother, Jack Fantasia, who for the longest time didn�t even know his brother and some of Alain�s friends initiated in fashioning a kingdom from literally �raw� materials. Till this day, how Alain and his friends gathered\nup the resources and magic to create the kingdom is unknown. The project\nstarted long before the split of the Weave, and even before the Creator\nRaces. Jack is under the impression that Enlightenment was made when Faerun\nwas beginning to form.\n\nAlain and a group of his friends managed to spark a new kingdom, a kingdom strictly fashioned for friends and family at the time. How the individual beings and Alain were able to creating something out of nothing is still a mystery, even to Jack Fantasia, who is older than his brother. Enlightenment is not on Faerun either, but rather, it is its own Demi-Plane in the Prime Material Plane that is located on Faerun. The people apart of the creation of Enlightenment have yet to be discovered, but it is most safely presumed that they were not humans, nor possible of the Prime Material Plane.\n\nEnlightenment has several ways of being accessed. One of which is simple by boat, that which can be sailed West of a citadel known as Candlekeep. Sailing west of Candlekeep one can find Enlightenment, only if the\nindividual, or group of people, harbor the strong enough desire to reach the\nland. Such a trip may take days, while others it may take only two hours,\neither way, they all experience the same; A shroud of white mist surrounds\nthe boat, then the land gets spotted, once the kingdom is found.\n\nThe second approach of finding Enlightenment would be by flying. Such a route is similar to that of sailing, only by air. A third path to reach\nEnlightenment would be through planar travel, if and only if the proper\nconduit is found. The last approach, which is one of the more difficult\napproaches, is by simple willing yourself over to Enlightenment.\nCircumstances must be met in order for the individual to do this; The person must have at least a little mental description of a spot, must\nconcentrate on that spot, and their will must be strong enough to do so.\n\nWith all these magical properties that Enlightenment is capable of, one\nwonders how exactly it all functions. Jack Fantasia himself knows that\nEnlightenment harbors a Mythal. The Mythal was created by Alain Fantasia,\nbut that ultimately killed his brother in the process. Through archives that\nJack has found, he learned of this, though he keeps it a secret. Arch magi\nwho visit or powerful clerics may be able to detect the mythal and its properties of course, should they even feel the need, but generally, once a\nperson finds the secret they keep to themselves for not knowing truly what\nmay happen to them upon speaking out.\n\nJack doesn�t know how Alain fashioned the mythal, but he does know that the\nmythal is similar to that of Evereska, only Enlightenment�s mythals allows the citizens within to be able to fly, climb on walls, and even teleport themselves across the land (Of course Enlightenments mythal holds more properties than Evereska, due to the time of its creation and how magic was more powerful). This extends to all who would wish no severe harm to the lands of Enlightenment.\n\nIn the years after Enlightenment was fashioned, and after the death of\nAlain Fantasia, Jack got word of his brother�s death through Divine\nresources. Allies helped Jack discover the land, and from there he\ninherited the Kingdom. For centuries the Nymbryxion had been Duke of the\ncity, and guardian as well. Now however, Jack has given the title up and allowed Democracy to reign, and now he is just Guardian of the rural\nregions mostly, only voicing his charismatic opinion with city affairs\nshould it be crucial. However, Democracy only goes so far, even in a\nsupposed �Utopia.� With the Temples and Guilds available in Alusair the main city, being run by powerful individuals, one can only ponder who how far the people truly have a say in things.\n\n((The current Guilds available within the main city, Alusair, are Water's Edge (which is a Casters Guild), and a Thieves Guild. The other organizations would be a Paladin Order that enforces the cities laws, and if someone wants to join one of the other available churches (Talos, Kelemvor, Cyric, Sune, and Bahamut, and much more) they can. Organizations outside of the city can be joining the elven Grove of Corellon, or a Bard's Playhouse. Also for the Drow players...there is an Underdark.))\n\n((The Churches of Lathander, Oghma, and Helm are the main government bodies. They establish the laws and each Temple divides what they do in the city.))\n\n((Many quests can be done in the server, as well as a nice \"Creature Pit\" (by CFBMoo1) for people to fight custom made monsters. A PvP Arena is available, but RP is still encouraged even in there. There is also fast-resting. It takes 5 or so seconds to rest.))\n\n((OOC Notice: Players do not really know of the mythal. They can obviously tell it harbors some powerful magic, but no one knows why. It isn't unheard of if a powerful arch magi or even a cleric discovering Enlightenment's secret. Mostly, once the info is found, it is kept to themselves on account of not knowing what may happen to them.))\n\n[The forums always has more info. No need to register either for reading. Registration is free though.

We live the now, and we know not where we go. We do, however, possess an inkling of our past. In her glorious and infinite wisdom, the Goddess Freya, blessed be her name, endowed the land with life some 15,000 years before this day. The civilization we enjoy on the Island was not always as it is. 500 years before this day, it much resembled the chaos and barbarism that one sees on the continent. Orc hordes and undead plagued the lands, but a civilizing force rose to meet this scourge and drive it from the Island. \nKing Andolyn Lain, the first King of Mythrendale, provided the organizing force around which the great knights of the Island could rally. 30 years of painful campaigning drove these evil forces from our lands. After careful consideration, King Lain formed a council of advisers which led to the creation of several Duchies. Each duke was responsible for a levy of arms and goods to keep the Kingdom in peace and plenty. Although the campaign had evicted the evil on the island, the source of the evil remained safely tucked away in the bowels of the savage continent. \nThe Council of Dukes realized that the only way to combat this terror was to push into the heart of the evil to fight it where it lives. Duke Jalal Otteh, renown for the use of his bronze flail in battle, set forth to establish this forward outpost on the continent. The first task appointed to him by the King was the creation of a temple dedicated to Freya. In the pre-dawn hours before the landing, as the fleet stood at anchor off the coast, Duke Otteh, heard a Valkyrie's voice whisper, �name the town Cherub's Abbey � in honor of the angels that will bless it by Freya's will.� The evening upon which he landed unopposed, he marked the land upon which Freya's Temple stands today, and he proclaimed the town to be Cherub's Abbey. \nOver the next several hundred years, the Abbey developed into the prime trading post between the Island and the Continent. The Duke and subsequent heirs to the Duchy took the title of Duke of Flail in honor of Jalal Otteh's favored weapon. The Dukes of Flail and their respective heirs created and then maintained a forward capitol city: City Seva in the heart of the Cloudshadow Mountains. Seva Keep stood guard as the only passable way into the valley, but it also served as the transit point for the City's only source of outside supply.\nHundreds of expeditions have set forth from Cherub's Abbey over the years in an attempt to map the far reaches of the continent in detail. Most returned not, but those that have provided the picture of the world that we have today. This picture does not tell us much detail beyond the lands surrounding Cherub's Abbey and the Duchy of Flail. The people of Mythrendale continue to wage war against the forces of darkness, and they persist until the Crusade for Civilization destroys the savagery on the Continent.","Rating":10,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"914":{"Title":"A Ring of Power - CEP 2.1","Author":"Cordaen","Submitted":20060416,"Updated":20080818,"Category":"Epic","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Number Players":"15-20","Setting":"Welcome to the realm of Bar'Mich Lyman.

Energy and fear radiate from it.*\n\n\"Heed my words adventurer! Make no mistake. It is for now, in my best interest to teach you of our world of Mellus so that you may become rich, powerful and famous. For when we meet again, I will crush you like all the others before and take all that you have\"\n\n\"I am Illiadians, one of a very few giant sorcerors of such power none but the dragons can stand against us! Many names I have had, Magnus the Cruel, Rombar of the Sailing Fire, Whorra advisor to the Emperor, and more.\"\n\n\"Now is the time for heros, villians, and adventurers! Mellus is a world ready to be shaped, raised, built, conquerored and remade! With the fall of the Katarious Empire, new kingdoms will arise, new magic discovered, ancient treasures unearthed, and rewards unheardof for the bold and the brave!\"\n\n\"What is the world of Mellus you ask?\"\n\n\"Mellus is a world unlike any other, for it is a globe so immense that entire lands have evolved entirely independant of each other. Exotic and magnifician civilizations grew and florished with little or no contact between each other. Scores of different races of beings inhabit this vast world all growing, fighting, living and loving,...until the horrid and malicious Katarious spider-people rose to power.\"\n\n\"The Katarious nation was a collection of spider like races (Spider Deamon, Giant Spider, Formian, Drider, and many lessor types) whose viciousness, intelligents, magic and brute strength allowed them to form the Empire of Katar and conquer many lands.\"\n\n\"Listen adventurer, as I tell you of the StormNexus\"\n\n\"In the Katar capital of Sar Sc�th there existed a power magical portal, the StormNexus. This device permitted the instant transport to and from the many lands of Mellus. The Katarious armies used this device to keep its strangle hold on almost all the other races and cultures of its empire. For thousands of years the Nexus was the true source of the Katarious Empire's power.\"\n\n\"Over time, the lords of the Katarious had few opponents to challenge them. Greed and a never-ending thirst for power led them to fight amongst themselves. The royal houses began in earnest to destroy each other, each thinking that they would emerge as emperor.\n\nWhen the time was right, my brothers and I (the illiadians) began to trick their Royal Katarious masters into dangerous conflict between each other. Soon the we began to sow the seeds of rebellion amongst the slave races.\n\nIt took over 400 years for enough decay to happen. In the end, it was the orcish hordes (Goblin, Orc, Hobgoblin, Bugbear,Orge) that finally rebelled outright. Retribution was swift, but the damage was enough to allow many other races to rebel.\n\nIt is the year 2929. The empire crumbled into fragments only 110 years ago. Mellus is a world of unrest, danger, hatred and opportunity for the bold, the noble, or the greedy. WIth the Empire is in tatters, new lands are emerging, with new heros, new wonders, undiscovered races and much more.\n\nGo then, fare well, fight hard, win, win, win!

Some of the most talented members of the NWN community have come together to contribute to this project, using all their knowledge of scripting, modeling, and building to turn the setting of DnD into that of the WoT.\n\nThe setting of 2R focuses around the region of the Two Rivers, which has begun devloping and prospering after its united stand against an invasion of trollocs. Players will find themselves venturing into the ancient caverns of the Mountains of Mist to discover lost secrets about Manatherin, then to the dangerous Forest of Shadows to discover why the locals of Devin Ride dare not venture deep into it. Eventually as players grow in strength, they will gain access to the outside cities of the world such as Tar Valon and Caemlyn, where they will be presented with all kinds of new evils, including Seanchen, Crazed dragonsworn, darkfriends, and eventually the Blight, with all its horrors. All keeping within accuracy of the WoT.\n\nThrough extensive editing of the NWN engine, we will also be introducing new classes, complete with PRCs such as Blademaster, Aes Sedai/Asha'man, and Gleeman. That, coupled with a Channeling System that will completely alter the way people cast spells, forcing channelers to embrace/seize the Source, and even learn weaves while being able to overchannel at great cost should they need to. Male channelers will also discover that madness does indeed come upon them, with a system of various ailments that will affect the MC, including RP missions for them to carry out as madness begins to take control.\n\nHere at 2R no detail has been left untouched, and it is our sincere hope that we can provide you with a PW that fulfills your vision of the WoT, and bring to life this incredible setting for all who visit.\n\nPlease make sure you visit the website for detailed information about the various features we will be implementing, and how we aim to breath life into 2R to make it truely worthy of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.\n\nThe Two Rivers is currently still in development, and will be released for the first time to the public on July 1st 2006.

All alignment restrictions have been removed (there wil be a mechanism for alignment changes IG). Some classes have been modified to the extent that their names have been changed and there are two new Classes that have been split, roughly, from the idea of Bard. \n\nArtisan \nThe Artisan is a character of not just knowledge, but with the skills to put that knowledge to use. Artisans become experts in their fields whether they be the Arts of Poetry or Music or the smithing and craftsmanship of items. \n\n-d6 hp \n-1/2 BAB progression \n-10 skill points/level \n-all skills class skills \n-recieve bonus Skill Focus feat at levels 5, 10, 15, 20 \n-starts off with simple weapons and light armour proficiency \n\nCleric \n-d6 hit die \n-Only light armour armour proficiencies at first level \n-Implosion, Darkfire and Finger of Death have been removed \n-Keen Edge added \n-Harm and Heal changed to 10 HP/level \n-Good and Evil domains have been removed. Phantasmal killer has been removed from Death domain. \n\nKnight Marshal \nThe Knight Marshal is a leader of men. They include military commanders, diplomats and staff aides. The knowledge of combat tactics and strategy is their realm, as well as the ability to inspire the troops under their command. \n\n-Can Inspire Allies/Demoralise Enemies (Bard Song, basically) \n-6 skill points per level \n-Lore skill bonus equal to their class level \n-Bonus feats at levels 10, 13, 16, 19 \n-Medium attack progression \n-d6 hit die \n-Starts off with medium armour, martial weapons and shield proficiencies. \n\nMonk \n-Class will be rebranded \n-Weapons proficiencies may be adjusted \n\nHunter \nThe Hunter is aptly named, for they are skilled in the arts of tracking and slaying their prey, whether that be man or beast. The Hunter is at home not just in the forest, but in the dark alleyways of the city or the twisting caverns of the Undercity. Some have been known to take up positions defending those of importance, their sharp senses making them particularly suited to this task. \n\n-Recieve Alertness feat at level 4 \n-Recieve Skill Focus: Spot, Listen, Search at level 8 \n-Recieve Disarm at level 12 \n-Recieve Expertise at level 16 \n-Recieve Uncanny Dodge at level 20 \n-Recieve d6 sneak attack at levels 5, 10, 15, 20 \n-Can keep a tame dog (rather than Animal Companion) \n-Have no divine spellcasting \n\nChanges to Prestige Classes \n\nThis will be added as it becomes finalized.","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"1-20","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","Schedule":"24/7 aside from crashes and so on.","Treasure":"High","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"Alignment restrictions have been removed, good/evil spells/abilities are being removed or rescripted to be law/chaos.","Experience Rewards":"Moderate to High","Races":"Human only.","PVP":"Full PvP","ApplicationReqs":"You don't have to write a bio for any character when you start playing them, but you must have written one before they can leave level 3. \n\nBios are meant to help you think about your character and give DMs some information to work with, as well as to ensure your character concept fits in with the world.

","Connection":"Cable","House rules":"\nPhilosophy of City of Winds \n\nThis place exists as a place for conflict RP. While PvP is an essential part of that, it's only a part, and should only take place within the bounds of RP motivation. Actual PvP - characters fighting - is opt-in for each player, so please respect the preferences of other players. \n\nEffort has been put into making a rich and complex IC society for players to enjoy. \n\nCharacters in CoW \nMultiple characters are allowed, but they must all be members of only one House. The maximum level for all characters is 20. \n\nCharacters in CoW may be of any alignment, but all except the very short lived ones are openly lawful, or remain out of sight. Upon character creation, you will be required to choose a House. In the future, there will be an option for non-aligned characters, but admission to one will be the only path to social advancement. See the other threads in this forum for information on races, classes etc. \n\nChanging Factions \n\nChanging your House will be allowed, but solely on an RP basis. This will be rare in CoW as the consequences of such actions are enormous. \n\nPvP \n\nPvP is freely allowed in any area you get to by leaving the City through either of the West and South gates. This includes all above-ground areas that aren't part of the City or Sunrise Isle, as well as various mines and caves outside the City. \n\nPvP is not allowed in any outdoor area of the City, except in the context of a formal duel. DMs may waive this rule for events where they are present. \n\nPvP is allowed, with consent, in all other areas (interiors of the City, as well as the Undercity and areas below it). \"With Consent\" means that you must get the explicit permission of everyone else present at the RP before engaging in PvP. The cleanest way to do this when two people are present is for one player to hostile the other player, and the other player to then un-hostile and re-hostile the first player. \n\nIt's bad form to reject PvP just because (for instance) you can't see the person who just hostiled you or you're outnumbered 5 to 1. If you often engage in PvP but choose not to just because the situation is unfavourable, you may receive a warning (see below). Note that if confronted by 5 other players, if you'd rather not PvP you could always leave the option of bribing them, or some other non-combat way of \"losing\". Similarly, if you're one of the five people and the target doesn't want to fight, you could always humiliate them (eg by making them run naked back to the nearest exit from the Undercity ). \n\nOOC Behaviour \n\nKeep all conflict IC. If you have problems OOC with another player, please approach a staff member about it rather than starting flamewars etc. \n\nIf someone says you are upsetting them with a particular line of RP or your choice of language, you are upsetting them. Stop. Do not argue. Stop. If you think they were doing this inappropriately, collect evidence in the form of logs and screenshots and send it to Mith with your arguement. At the time, stop. If someone did not stop when you asked them to, collect evidence in the form of logs and screenshots and send it to Mith. \n\nPlease do not use this to try and get out of IC consequences for IC actions, this is for when, for example, a player is using particularly foul language and a child is watching the game over your shoulder, or if you can't stand cruelty to animals and don't want to play out the torture of your Hunter's dog. \n\nAggressive OOC behaviour will be met with a warning, see below. \n\nLanguage \n\nThere are no rules on language in CoW, except for those established by society's codes. How far will a character who uses coarse language travel up the rungs of polite society? You may find out. \n\nBanned Subjects for RP \n\nThere are some subjects that are simply deemed inapproriate to \"play\" in any form. These are rape, child abuse of any kind and suicide, with the exception of honour motivated actions along the lines of Japanese \"Seppuku\" or the Roman \"falling on your sword.\" If you have any doubts, contact staff and ask. \n\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behaviour \n\nCoW operates a simple three strikes system. Your first two warnings have no effect (no temp ban or anything) and the third strike is a ban. Warnings are given by Mith, usually at the recommendation of staffers. \n\nBanned players may be allowed back at a later date at Mith's discretion. \n\nA Note on Recruiting \n\nPlease do -not- recruit using facilities provided for other worlds (PMs or forum postings in other worlds' forums, Tells or party chat IG, etc). It's not polite to those worlds. \n\nAll recruiting should be done via email, IM, phone or any other non-game method. Bioware forums are also OK, of course.","Content Guide":"Mature","RolePlay":"Heavy","Description":"City of Winds is currently in open beta.\n\nThe City of Winds is based around the Game of Houses. The City is controlled by the Emperor, who is literally divine, but who never speaks, so all the political decisions are really made by the Voice of the Emperor, who comes from the House which was most powerful when the last Voice tragically passed away. As the Voice being from your House gives you a rather nice advantage, they tend to have tragic accidents rather often.\n\nThe module is designed to encourage and support the roleplay of this conflict, and ensure that there is always something for you to do to advance your House, or yourself as there are also options for unaligned characters, though this path is far more taxing. The City is lawful in nature, so whilst members of Houses might kill each other in a fight over resources, in the City they will nod and smile politely.\n\nBelonging to one of the Houses is recommended, as it automatically gives you a group of people to interact and plot with IG.\n\nIf you enjoy PvP outside the City are resource areas, which you can fight other Cs for control of, employ mercenaries to defend and claim for your own House so they can access the resources and gain power (measured by the Faction score, which can be seen here http://asako.zapto.org/factions.jsp), and this also increases your personal reputation, tracked here http://asako.zapto.org/ranks.jsp.\n\nIf you want to craft, we have a heavily customised version of the CNR which allows you to create mundane items (although the items go up to level 20 the vast majority of items you will find are merely made from a particularly strong metal, say, which makes it harder for blows to injure you) and a gem socketing system which allows you to create your own necklaces, rings, cloaks and belts by setting certain gems you find into socketed items.\n\nIf you'd rather avoid PvP it isn't allowed without consent in the City and areas beneath it, so you can fight the minions of the Dark One to keep the City safe.\n\nFor politics a Court session is held every Sunday at 8pm UK time, where there will be plenty of people around to plot and scheme with.\n\nThe world is set up to react to player actions as much as possible - news is published every week, guards are scripted to react if you try and bash down doors in front of them, PCs gain reputation by crafting, questing or claiming resources and once they have a certain reputation can challenge the leader of their House, if they think they would do a better job. House leaders have a great deal of power, for example the leader of House Drannis is currently proposing a lift to make it easier to get down to fight the Dark One's minions.\n\nCharacter classes have been customised to fit in with the setting, so clerics are the only casters and there are other classes such as Expert for those who want to play a non-combat character or academic and Knight Marshal, who can inspire his allies or demoralise his enemies as well as being a general jack of all trades. There's no need to worry about making the most efficient build as you can gain XP from crafting, researching, training or praying (this is also used to mark the power of your god), exploration and sneaking past enemies.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"948":{"Title":"Avantari","Author":"Yavanna","Submitted":20060627,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"CEP-1.53 Requires Community Expansion Project","Website":"ttp://www.avantari-nwn.co","Number Players":"40","Setting":"Forgotten Realms based, using D&D rules","Number DMs":"7","IPs":"70.61.222.100:5121","Staff Requirements":"extensive roleplay experience, time spent on server, competence with Faeurunian knowledge as well as D&D rules.","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"1-40, however levelling is relatively slow and we do not have any characters over level 23 at present.","Magic Level":"Moderate","Schedule":"persistent","Treasure":"Moderate","Number Servers":"1","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Races":"humans, elves, hin, dwarves, gnomes, orcs.

This is a continent not mentioned in the Dragonlance novels. Mainly because the tales have no happy ending as of yet. No group of heroes has been able to conquer the evils of this land, though many have tried. \n\n\n\nSome time ago, a planeswalker opened up a portal to Arkanis. He found a land rich in resources and fairly unpopulated; just right for his domination. Calling forth the undead of the continent, he raised an army that none had ever seen before. Ihsan Castle asked for the elves for their aid. The elves of the Phoenix castle only desired that their forests remain safe and saw no point in wasting time with war when it did not concern them at the time. The Lady Phoenix of the castle protected them. The Ihsans were left to battle these new foes alone. The Ihsan Castle fought battle upon battle, each of them weakening the enemy but not stopping them. Weakened and at their last few knights, the Lord of Ihsan commanded that their gnomes invent a gigantic Boompowpullitbacktodestroyallenemiesmachine (BoomPow for short). Unfortunately, the gnomes made a fatal error in their invention and destroyed much of their castle, knights, and the Lord of Ihsan. A few elves left Sylvan, realizing the peril their home was in and met with some humans, minotuars, and other races that were left homeless due to the war and they fled to a northern island. There, they founded a new order of knighthood and built a castle that they named Talon. The races of Talon Castle tried to rally the others together to try and fight back this new foe, but Ihsan was too badly wounded to help, and scornful of the elves for their turmoil so they refused to assist. It was up to the heroes of the Talon castle to defeat the new enemies of the Obsidian Castle. Through a harrowing battle upon the ramparts of Talon Castle, the planeswalker was defeated. Yet, his legend and vision lives on through the Obsidian Castle followers. Some even believe that the planeswalker can one day be resurrected again to lead them to victory.\n\n- We are a very friendly community looking for a nice boost in players in this ever expanding world! \n\n- There is a nice collection of Subraces to choose from including Werewolves, Minotaurs and Vampires!\n\n- four major factions.

Before that it was in chaos. The change from the time of chaos to the Times of Good happened when the Ancient Northern Shrine fought to overthrow the former rulers and won.

These rulers are completely unbiased and do not take sides versus good or evil instead only stepping in when needed to protect the people of the realm. \n\nThe Davenport family in itself has always been large. For some reason that no one has been able to explain each generation has multiple children with twins and triplets being extremely common. The royal family of Davenports have a very interesting bloodline being ¾ Dragon and ¼ Elf. However their cousins having 1/8 human in their blood have a curse that is thought to be brought on by Black Dragons. This curse causes at least one child to go against their parents in beliefs and values. \n\nFor 10 centuries Elanst�wyn Shire has lived in peace but now the Times of Trouble are upon them. Creatures that used to stay in their holes are now coming out in abundance, Vampires have moved into the realm setting up a society and rumors have it Lycanthropy has begun to run rampant.

Information about the Dwemer's arrival is almost entirely unknown, but the Chimer are a very different story. They were led there by Veloth, who followed Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala, unlike the Orsimer who followed Malacath.\n\nHere the Chimer and Dwemer feuded for decades, until the early Nordic settlers came out of Skyrim and took control of Morrowind, then Dunmereth. In 1E 412, the Chimer and Dwemer united to drive off the human invaders, and named the nation Resdayn. This peace lasted until the War of the First Council.\n\nThe Tribunal do not appear in human records until after the first eruption of Red Mountain in Vvardenfell, which resulted in a permanent shift of population south toward the Deshaan Plains. The Tribunal, composed of Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, were the advisors of Nerevar Indoril, the first Hortator of the Chimer. They are notable as the immortal gods of the Tribunal Temple, a position to which they ascended using Kagrenac's Tools on the Heart of Lorkhan. Soon, the ancestor worship that had dominated Morrowind since ancient times was overtaken by the monolithic Tribunal Temple, and the worship of the ALMSIVI (ALMalexia, Sotha SIl and VIvec).\n\nMorrowind stayed out of the eye of the rest of the continent for quite some time, except for a few notable episodes, such as the Morag Tong assassination of the last Reman Emperor, which led to the rise of the Akaviri Potentate and the period known as the Interegnum. Morrowind stayed this way until the end of the Second Era, when the new Emperor Tiber Septim set his mind on uniting all of Tamriel. To avoid a costly war, the Tribune Vivec met in secret negotiations with the Emperor, which resulted in Vivec trading the Numidium to the Empire in order for a great deal of independence. Since then, Morrowind has been mostly stable under the stewardship of the humourless and tradition-obsessed Dark Elves, except for an episode involving Dagoth Ur and the fulfillment of the Nerevarine Prophecy.\n\nAfter this episode, Dagoth Ur, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil were killed. Vivec may or may not still be alive, but this still remains to be confirmed. During this time, Queen Barenziah returned to Morrowind. Her son, Helseth, was made the new King of Morrowind after the sudden death of King Llethan. Helseth outlawed slavery, and reformed the Grand Council, which includes the heads of all great houses. The Great Houses themselves are adjusting to the new powers in the land. Some, like Dres and Hlaalu, appear to be on the rise, reembracing the new traditions while welcoming the return of the old. Others, such as Indoril and Redoran, seem to be waning, unable to change with the times.\n\nAnother major event in Morrowind history was The Imperial Invasion of Morrowind.\n\n","Rating":9.88,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"977":{"Title":"Chronicles of Isord","Author":"Softangel","Submitted":20060822,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Other","Patch Version":"Requires Both Expansions (SoU & HotU)","Website":"ackmygame.co","Number Players":"1>40","Number DMs":"One","IPs":"192.168.0.2 (70.56.70.26)","Staff Requirements":"Basic knowledge of toolset, and DMFI tools.","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"Any","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"1>40","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","Schedule":"All the time.","Treasure":"High","Number Servers":"One","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Alignments":"Any","Experience Rewards":"Moderate to High","Races":"Basic","PVP":"Full PvP","ApplicationReqs":"None.

Enlightenment�s location is greatly beneficial to itself, in the fact that it can import and export goods from and to Amn, and from and to the Moonshae Isles. An �Enlightened Oligarchy� rules over the main city and the city-limits, providing a fair rule and reasonable laws.\n\nThe three temples that rule as the cities Enlightened Oligarchy is the Church of Lathander, Church of Oghma, and Church of Helm. They work independently as much as they do dependently. The head leaders of each church normally gather together to ratify new political ideas and/or revoke ideas presented to them by their proper 5-member council. While those three temples rule over the city however, the outer regions have no proper proprietor, and are considered to be �wild lands�.\n\nThe denizens within the demi-plane recognize that a large amount of their heritage comes from Netherese wizards, and/or elves. Outsiders to Enlightenment can normally stumble upon Enlightenment by accidental means. Rumors say that there are special conduits in the air and sea. There is only a selective few ways a visitor can go to and from Enlightenment. Though for the importing and exporting commerce that partakes there, special portals and teleports are used to get the goods to the proper person.\n\nFor outsiders to actually come across Enlightenment they must meet the following; Somehow through books and/or rumors, the individual heard of a kingdom so mysterious and magical, that by formulating a clear picture of the place within their minds, they were capable of �willing� themselves over to Enlightenment. A person could very well fly towards the general direction and/or sail, and when that happens, and if the person has the desire to see Enlightenment, they can find themselves surrounded in a calming mist, and eventually be taken to Enlightenment. Finally, through mere dreams, a person fined themselves stumbling into Enlightenment after waking up. Of course the alternative to it all is if the outsider is directly being taken to Enlightenment by a possible friend, family member, or acquaintance that lives there.\n\n\nLife and Society\n\nThe denizens within the city are dependent upon those who live outside of the cities limits for their agricultural needs. Farmers, those who are typically legitimate ones, can get direct help from the government when it comes down to needing protection. Extra money to help with the years crops can come from the government as well when necessary. Farmers work hard to provide food for the city, for themselves, and for the government to have a successful exporting carrier when it comes to exporting fruits and grain.\n\nLike most places within Faerun, religion is held in high-regard about the kingdom. A good 97% of the denizens within the demi-plane give their proper tribute to a deity. Visiting priests and clergy to Enlightenment often want to establish a church within the city, or even outside. Though building outside of the city would avoid taxes, most churches wish to build where the population is, for obvious reasons. Though there are three ruling churches within the city, they do not repress religion; the philosophy of �religious tolerance� is held within the cities limits, so long as each religion follows the law.\n\nFor the rest of the people within the city, they�re divided up into three classes; The Working Class, the Clergy Men, and Nobles. The Clergy Men operate within temples, providing healing services and medical goods, or shelter, to those that need it. The working class helps the city move forward with their economy of course, and the Nobles affiliate themselves with the political debates the city undergoes. There is taxation for each class, regardless of their specific religion or not.\n\nThe people are ruled by three main churches; Church of Lathander, Church of Oghma, and Church of Helm. Each church has their proper worshippers, their proper clergy members, a council of five decision-lawmaking members, and then the head leader. Typically each council member of the church would gather up in their proper church to discuss a possible new law needing to be incorporated, or even changed. Upon coming to a conclusion, the members report to their leaders (whom have nearly direct influence from the corresponding deity) for the final word. Once the leaders have the information that they need, the three leaders will come together to further discuss the topic; if it is a wise thing to do, if it is needed, if it�s balance, and overall, if it�s stable.\n\nMajor Organizations\n\nThe organizations stated here can either be found within the city, or outside of the city.\n\nMost Noble Order of the Triad: This Order of paladins help police and bring law to city members and protect the rights of visitors. Veteran paladins within the Order act as judges or lawyers, and squires follow their proper sponsor on patrols throughout the city. Though they are not told to do so, the paladins within the Most Noble Order of the Triad often establish crusades to travel outside of the city, in order to establish peace, if there is a possible evil threat.\n\nMasking Knives Alliance: The guild of thieves in the city. The Masking Knives Alliance members give the local paladin Order the most trouble. The thieves for the most part are passive, but it is known that they have caused unneeded deaths and even changed political points-of-views. The leader is unknown, as is the location of the guild.\n\nGuild of the Weave: Though it is not required, many wizards and sorcerers find the Guild of the Weave to be highly beneficial for them. Within the guild members have access to many rare and magical goods, as well as tutoring if need be. Rogue casters can come here to learn the Art more effectively as well. The Guild of the Weave is a rather powerful organization of Casters, and even the leader in the guild is known to give influence on certain city policies.\n\nHarper�s Mansion: Though they keep to themselves and remain secretive, the Harper�s within the city do their best to prevent an overflow of �unneeded� outsiders behind the scenes. The local paladin order doesn�t complain, and turns their head away at the Harpers works at times. More often than not though, there have been disputes on how the Harpers operate within the city. Some contend that all �outsiders� should be allowed, while others think the Harper�s �filtering� of some specific races is a needed thing. Whatever the case may be, they have been fair in their dealings, and normally assign a member within the community to spy upon newly arrived visitors, making sure they�re not there to cause an unbalance.\n\nSinging Tongues Theatre: The Singing Tongues Playhouse Theatre is located outside of the city, and is the local entertainment for residents outside of the city. However, city dwellers do frequent the place to witness the many performances that partake within the Playhouse. Many traveling skalds and bards enjoy traveling to the Playhouse to perform for people, or seek to actually join the Theatre. The current bards within the theatre work diligently on making their business known.\n\nChurch of Lathander: The richest church, and one of the three rulers that encompasses the cities �Oligarchy�, Lathander�s church provides much for the cities wealth and architecture. Bureaucracy is handled by the church as well, and much of the cities money is found within Lathander�s church. Wisely and fairly, the council members under the watchful gaze of the temple leader (Sunrise Lord Alen�ken�kir), distribute the money where it needs to be.\n\nChurch of Oghma: The scholars and inventors, the thinkers and writers, the council members within the church of Oghma are responsible for maintaining laws that never repress intellectual growth. Oghma�s church is also responsible for schools to be kept in order, and for their massive library to always be stocked with new and useful books. Some say that within a few years the library located within Oghma�s Temple may even rival that of Candlekeep. The temple leader, Alofin of Oghma, watches over his council members.\n\nChurch of Helm: The Vigilant One, Helm, isn�t shunned away or treated indifferently within the city, as in some places of Faerun, despite the past troubles. His followers and clergy men are gladly accepted in their political ways and protective demeanor. The Church of Helm is responsible for laws concerning their own militia, and the temple leader (Sir Darvin Arniman of Helm) makes sure that his council of five members keeps inline. Military men are positioned about the city as a type of �watcher�. Though the paladin Order police and bring justice, the military try to prevent invasion and large riots.\n\n\nMajor Geographical Features\n\nWintry Slopes: These massive slopes extend high up into the air, with the peaks kissing a snow-filled sky. Travelers should be wary when traveling alone in the Slopes. Bugbears have been known to cause unneeded ambushes. For the most part, the place holds spectacular and breath-taking scenery for all to marvel.\n\nNyrad'afel: Or, �Diamond Leaf Lake�, is a gorgeous lake, surrounded by even more lovely trees to compliment the beauty of the lake that lies within the heart of Enlightenment almost. Rarely people complain about what the scenery has to offer, and even more rarely would anyone encounter any trouble within the region.\n\n\nImportant Sites\n\nWintry Cavern: The Wintry Cavern is where the cities diamond facility is located. Though outside of the city and located at Wintry Slopes, the city does provide a charter and guards for the miners. Possible the most dangerous place too, in all of Enlightenment. It is said that below the mines lies a completely new world. One filled with the Drow.\n\nKy�dre�s Temple District: Here are where the laws are made and the people go to for most of their guidance (unless a church of theirs is established elsewhere). Beautiful temples have been constructed for the three main governing churches at the Temple District.\n\nThe Tomb of Genesis: A powerful history surrounds the Tomb of Genesis. Many of the denizens in Enlightenment do not know of its origins, and do not wish to press for information. Those who go into the tomb, rarely ever last longer than five minutes before having to have been reported missing, or running out in sheer madness. Whatever is within the tomb, possible only the Church of Helm may know, for they guard all of the documents ever made within the kingdom.\n\n\nRegional History\n\n�And after Chauntea was finished crafting Abeir-Toril, and when life was placed upon the soil of Faerun, and once Mystryl, the daughter of Selune, breathed the Art over the lands, the elves and metallic dragons did gather together to perform a conjuration ceremony to escape the orcs and chromatics.�\n~Quote from an ancient parchment within the archives of Helm�s Temple.\n\nNo one could possible believe, and even fully understand, the creation of Enlightenment. Its very nature screeches out magic. Some contend that Enlightenment can be consumed by the weave completely, if the place even grows unstable. But for now, the demi-plane that lies near Faerun has timelessly never disappointed their original creators; the elves and metallic dragons.\n\nIn the year -10,000 of Faerun�s creation, when not even the Dale Reckoning calendar was fashioned, Sun elves had gathered around with a group of metallic dragons, ranging from Gold, Silver, Brass, Bronze, and Copper, to discuss the newly forming and evolving lands around them. It is said that amongst the Silver Dragons, a dragon named Ornvivex, had prophesied the future quarrels and wars between the elves and the drow, and the King-Killer star driving many of the dragons to madness, causing them to openly attack and destroy most of what they see. This wise silver dragon, reportedly now dead after living since the dawn of creation, up to 1372 DR, discussed the means of a primitive, yet a powerful form, of a �Genesis� spell. The spell worked successfully.\n\nThe High Magi gathered around in a circle to begin their circle magic. Ornvivex was preparing his �spellfire�, a rare form of casting, especially for that time. Through instinct though, the dragon knew how to manipulate the power. As the casters began the ceremony, the other dragons gathered around the wise silver, and both parties began to chant and cast. The wanted outcome; a new kingdom, located within a demi-plane as a type of safe haven for both elves and metallic dragons, form the future tussles that Faerun will provide, and for peace.\n\nAs planned, the ritual worked, to some extent. As planned, the High Magi within the circle directed the concentrated flow of magic to the Silver Dragon, and the Silver concentrated his enhanced spellfire to the High Magi. Upon a mid-air collision, the ground shook and split, all the birds within the world took flight into the air, all the Gods gazed upon the formation of the first demi-plane to ever be fashioned in such a way, and in the end, the demi-plane slowly began to chaotically manipulate itself before the eyes of onlookers. A new universe was being fashioned, before the eyes of the worn-casters, and a new universe that would provide a home for them was being formed successfully, for the most part.\n\n4,000 years later, Enlightenment was born. By now, all the elves who were apart of the ritual had died, as did the metallic dragons. Two silvers remained alive, Ornvivex and his brother, and a few gold dragons. Once they discovered that the demi-plane was stable, and land had formed, the dragons traveled about the continent of Faerun, in search of elves to come and populate the kingdom. Successfully this happened still, and as time went by, many elven structures were erected and fashioned about the new, fresh lands.\nWhat was neglected and not predicted though, was Godly intervention. The heavenly war in Arvandor between Araushnee and the Seldarine had left the woman into an exiled state, and Araushnee is now known as Lolth. Lolth immediately had setout to try and fashion an Underdark during the formation of Enlightenment, but she wasn�t the only God or Goddess to pitch in a hand. Other deities did their best to have a say in how the lands should look like, though unknown to the casters who originally fashioned the demi-plane at the time.\n\nAs time passed, the elves and metallic dragons lived peacefully within Enlightenment. When news of the Crown War reached the denizens within Enlightenment though, many of them left to bring support to their brethren in Faerun. Little did they expect a drow invasion from below, within their comfortable demi-plane. Once the invasion began though, many were slaughtered. Even metallic dragons.\n\nThe battle was fierce. Demons had been conjured up by many of the Drow casters to battle against the Dragons. There is a far� fetched rumor even that the Prince of Demons, Demogorgon, beckoned by Lolth to go to Enlightenment, was there during the first battle over Enlightenment; The Battle of Genesis. The Battle of Genesis ended a little bit before the end of the Crown Wars. Many of the elves were killed that resided within Enlightenment, and their beautifully structured cities were razed and demolished by many of the demons. All dragons died but one, and if Demogorgon was present during the battle, he was banished by that one dragon; Ornvivex.\n\nThe Silver Dragon left the demi-plane with pain and defeat heavy within his mind. Weary and tired, he traveled off and away from Enlightenment, and from Abeir-Toril in general. His disappearance is a mystery to this day, but scholars contend to say that the dragon possible went to Air Elemental Plane to spend time healing, and traveling the planes on a quest for tranquility, or love. However during his vacationing, the remaining elves managed to push back the rest of the drow, and seal up a portal that leads into the Underdark.\n\nTime passed and the few elves there pressed to survive. The demi-plane still remained beautiful, and naturally the place provided a magical regeneration of sorts. When the call of Evermeet came to the elves however, the remainder felt it best to leave Enlightenment, and answer the call. Unlike most elves though, the call came later for these elves, and once they commenced their own migration, the Netherese Empire was at its maximum efficiency.\n\n As many may know, Karsus the Mad managed to cause the weave to split. He caused Mystryl to sacrifice herself in hopes of saving the Weave (which she did), but later reincarnate herself as Mystra (who is different than the current Mystra). What many people do not know is there were very few magi that predicted the fall of Netheril. There were magi here and there that began to plot a means of survival for the future. Upon research and strong scrying, the magi discovered a demi-plane that lies within Abeir-Toril, but lies outside of most of the planets events. These magi had even predicted that, should the weave ever split, the plane would be unaffected.\n\nThe Netherese casters traveled out to Enlightenment, the demi-plane that they discovered. There many of them found elven documents of how the lands were created, and what had happened in the years. The Netherese kept the documents preserved as best as possible still, as the elves had previously been doing. The men brought women and children to Enlightenment, and quickly other Netherese magi were hearing of Enlightenment. Before too long though, this little migration of Netherese Magi caught the attention of the Phaerimm, whom soon followed the Netherese to begin the second war that Enlightenment was put through.\n\nThey came in small numbers but with a powerful force, the Phaerimm. Immediately upon finding a way to get into Enlightenment, they began to destroy the crops the Netherese were growing. Since Enlightenment operates outside of normal time, little did they know what had been happening to the other Netherese Empires. They were falling, for as they predicted, the Weave was splitting, causing the floating enclaves to greatly weaken and crash to the feature land known as the Anauroch Desert.\n\nThe Second Battle of Genesis only lasted 6 months against the Phaerimm and the Netherese Wizards. The more important outcome of the battle is, denizens within Faerun, those that reside in the Moonshae Isles and along the Sword Coast region, could see up in the sky the light-shows made by the casters and the Phaerimm. No one knew exactly what they were seeing, but the result of the second battle is that rumors began to spread around Faerun concerning a mysterious �world� in the skies.\n\nLife wasn�t easy for the Netherese after they managed to defeat the Faerun. The population was down to a total of 120 men and women. To balance out what they had lost, the few wizards began to open up conduits within the sea and sky, in hopes that travelers would stumble across the demi-plane by either sailing, or flying. Never did they want to directly make it known that there was a demi-plane within Abeir-Toril directly. Upon creating such conduits, and using magic to further enhance Enlightenment by allowing people to stumble across it through mere dreams and willpower, the remainder of the Netherese wizards had died.\n\n To this day, much of what had happened in the past remains a strong secret. As the Netherese had hoped, travelers did manage to come across the demi-plane and began to fill in the lands with people. The city of Ky�dre, a worn-down ancient elven city was rebuilt with a humanistic touch to it, and a government was then formed by three temples. Any documents the Netherese Wizards had were mostly placed within a Tomb they referred to as �Tomb of Genesis�, which houses nearly all of the documents ever recorded in Enlightenment. It is said that documents too, are held within the Church of Helm, guarded vigilantly by Helm�s followers and Helm himself.\n\nNowadays the denizens within Enlightenment live a tranquil life, and a rich one. Many businesses have opened up within the city limits, and they began to export goods and services to the Moonshae Isles and to Amn. Portals directly connected to the business partners have been directly established to keep Enlightenment still a mystery and secret, and even if rumor does get out, the denizens in Enlightenment do not mind too much; more people means more business. Folklore tells tales of mighty wizards from ages past wanting to keep Enlightenment a secret, so to this day that idea holds true. No one knows of the elves and the metallic dragons, unless they happen to have a document of recorded history, and no one can understand why Enlightenment is where it is.\n\nPlots and Rumors\n\nGreat Wyrm from the Past: Often times a massive shadow covers over the entire lands. Those who notice and look up, see nothing in the sky. Those who try to use divination magic to discover what this shadow is, gain nothing in return. The heavy smell of fresh rain lingers about the region, and more often than not, rain does form after the shadow passes. Magi of the Guild of the Weave suggest it�s an ancient silver dragon, but no one is certain. Could it be that Ornvivex is back? And if so, why?\n\nThe Darkness Below: Diamond workers have been complaining about disturbances from below the mines. The more they dig, the more monsters come to the miners to attack. This is mostly because of a secret passage that the miners found, but they assume the other poundings they make cause unrest. Is it truly the miners that are causing the monsters below the mining facility in the Wintry Slopes to be restless? Or could it be that the legendary drow wish to resurface?\n\nWater and Fish Tales: Fishing boats have reported deck mates missing within the past couple of weeks. Captains have reportedly seen odd fish within the water, and the smell of a sea-battle may be near. It could be Enlightenment�s first naval combat in recorded history, but, who knows? The local military watch near the docks have been reported missing as well, only to be found 3 days later with a trident pierced through their chest. The local guild has identified the tridents as Sahuagin tridents. Why can�t the Sahuagin�s just stay in the water?","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"987":{"Title":"Shadows Of Eunglaris","Author":"DM_Sune","Submitted":20060915,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"CEP-2.00 Requires Community Expansion Project","Website":"ttp://www.setbb.com/soeforums/index.php?mforum=soeforum","Number Players":"1-30","Setting":"Dungeons and Dragons pantheon, terminology, and influence.

Faltan, buried in the highest peaks of the Ironforge Mountains, down along the fertile valley floor to the river Rua to the east, the lands known as Ilmara sweep south and west to the sea. Settled long ago, first by the Arcane scholars known as the Valnim and their subjects, Ilmara has proved since its founding to be a land rich in opportunity and intrigue. As banners were raised and cast asunder, the lands and the people who live among them have become defined and resolved.\n\n\nThe Original settlers were the ancient wizard-rulers known as the Valnim. Of these dark sorcerers little is known save for the cruel dedication to the arts of magic, and their pursuit of knowledge above all else. This drive caused their dominance of Ilmara to fail, and it was many years of nomadic tribes that occupied Ilmara after their legendary fall. Some claim civil war ended the Valnim, others say a dark power was unleashed that consumed them. Whatever their end, their demise gave way to the fledgling kingdom of Lynea.\n\n\nLynea was a kingdom forged on the will of a young King. His heirs managed to hold the dream together for some two and a half centuries, beating back the wandering tribes of humanoids and random beasts that preyed on the edges of human settlement. Their existence was hard, but determined, and it wasn�t until the first galleys of the Ognan Empire sailed in from the South to trade goods that Lynea found a foe she could not defeat. The Ognans came in the guise of traders, but later sent troops to secure the safety of their vessels. The Ognans soon declared open war, and with such vast resources at their beck and call, swept of the Lands of Ilmara and united them under the banner of the Emperor of the Sun.\n\n\nThe Ognans made fundamental changes to the lands of Ilmara. They brought advanced smithing techniques, and farming techniques as well. They introduced commerce and currency. They renamed the Lynean capital city of Koranth for the broad and gentle river that gave the valley its lifeblood. This is how Ruathym was born.\n\n\nThe Ognan Empire fell into decadence and decay. When the crazed Emperor Hiathis plunged the once-mighty nation into all out Civil War, the Empire crumbled under its own weight. Refugees fleeing the chaos of home flocked to Ruaythm, and the city became a rich target for bandits, humanoids and even legendary beasts. Without the armies of Ognan to offer protection, things look very bleak for the city indeed.\n\n\nFrom the ashes of that chaos, the Knights of the Silver Falcon arose. Led by their founder, Sir Montrose Corvale, the knights turned the city into a fortress. Now known as a safe haven from the age of chaos, the city swelled with population as people desperately sought a place to live in relative peace. The Knights eventually moved out from their wallec citadel, reclaiming the lands of Ilmara inch by bloody inch. Pushing the humanoids and beasts to the edges of those lands, allowing people to once again settle across the valley floor. A time of legend and glory ensued, and Sir Montrose rose to the title of Lord-Mayor. Later, as more lands were reclaimed, he became Prince and declared the city-state of Ruathym free, now and forever more.\n\n\n**Module Features**\n\n* Modified CNR crafting system.\n\n* Persistant Inn system\n\n* Persistnat Banking system\n\n* Subrace system\n\n* PGS Player guild system\n\n* Dialoge driven custom rest system, including location saving, player list wiht location\n\n* persistant Journals\n\n* Persistnat BBS system\n\n* HTF hunger, thirst system & adverse weather effects\n\n* player location persistant across server resets\n\n* player health persistant between server resets\n\n* 700+ areas for players to explore\n\n* many scripted NPC quests with more coming all the time","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"995":{"Title":"Isles of Esperia PW","Author":"Esperian Staff","Submitted":20061004,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Uses Stone of Recall / Town Portal","Patch Version":"Requires Both Expansions (SoU & HotU)","Website":"ttp://esperiapw.proboards58.com/index.cg","Setting":"Custom made world","Number DMs":"3","IPs":"68.2.250.76:5121","Staff Requirements":"Authorization from OmegaDM & Rooker1963","Scope":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Classes":"2 custom Prestige Classes currently running.

Deep in the core of the planet Aber Toril ( Faerun is one continent ) and hidden from allmost all mortals the 3 gods Chauntea, Talos and Auriel created the Inner Realms milinia ago in a massive contest of creation. Thus from their devine hands and minds sprung forth the strange and highly magical World withinn the world. To read the background story of the Inner Realms use this link�\n\nClick Here\n\nThe ALANGARA server offers a mixture of roleplay and adventure to the players and to the best of our ability we try to recreate the known PnP atmosphere, where in one moment enemy players are justing on word and philosophies and in the next their are chatting friendly to eachother or perhaps OOC debating about some idea of sorts for the server overall. We only force Roleplay to the extend that players should speak as if they were indeed that character when in public.\n\nWhat players decide to do whena group of friends together is solely their own business as long as they all agree on it.\n\nThe main philosophy from the two main worldbuilders/owners have allways been to create a server where it is the life and option of the players themselves that is in focus. To this end we have designed a very challenging world indeed �forcing� players to form friendships or factions/adventure group to be able to accomplish the most epic of quests. We believe that good roleplay should also be encouraged by the world itself by allowing the players to actually have some �real issues� to roleplay about. As such we offer various options such as�\n\n- Player build housing.\n- Playerbuild lands.\n- Even playerbuild cities � can one afford it�\n- Playermade guilds with custom guild structures, teleports guildvendors etc etc.\n- Different ingame factions to support of fight.\n- Lots of NPC quests to entertain you.\n- Playerfarms adding a new range of options to the game such as�\n\n- creating magical custom gear\n- gain xp and gold from farming\n- use spcial plants to get other sort of special gear adding to your personnal power in combat\n\nAnother aspect we have been working alot with is the intire atmosphere and user friendlyness of the server. We have been working very hard to provide a host of different scenarious in order to optain a visual beautyful world which inspires the players to roleplay and explore rather than forcing it down as a server rule. Quite soon we will even have an oracle where the players can learn about what quest they have yet to explore so that players get a better idea of their option in the world.\n\nThis link will take you to our screenshot gallery�\n\nhttp://www.tesgames.com/gallery/\n\nWith lots and lots of special items ranging from mondane statincreasement rings to highly powerfull items the players also have a lot to work towards without the need of continual DM intervention. In generel we believe in having DMs for that extra diversity and exitement but overall we believe that the true life of the server should be defined and lived out by the players themselves.Afterall what makes a computerworld come to life is its community of players and their interpretation of the world as whole.\n\nAnother aspect of ALANGARA is a genuine desire for fairness and ballance. In ALANGARA we have taken many a step to ballance the players options no matter what class and or combination they choose. To that aim many combinations are banned from the server and the shifterclass is outrigt removed. This might seem like pointless nerfing to some, but what we have achived ( judgeing from the feedback of the playerbase ) with this and the many different boost we also have implemented is a world where all classes have their use and in term no class dominates it all. In ALANGARA you will se no cleric �deathfield� plowing through the zones. No mages blasting everything to oblivion with maximazed greator missiles. No rogues �tanking� better than the fighters themselves etc etc. We are still strugling to get the ballance �perfect� but on the bright side those cases which are currently under evaluation are actually about upgrades�\n\nOur intention is to make sure that a player can choose whatever class they would find FUN to roleplay, and without a great indept knowledge of the gamemechanics ( ie not an experinced powerbuilder ) still come out with a character that is indeed usefull, While on the other hand no player / character build should be able to stand alone on the high epic levels.\n\nFreedom of Fantasy�.\n\nThe NWN engine as such offers the fantastic ability of the players to keep on playing while the DM(s) are not around. As such we have a rich world that can take care of all players need to adventure and find challange, strategy and teamplay at all hours. The Downside of NWN, compared to PnP, is on the other hand that the indept of a �round the table session� can be hard to create on a computergame.\n\nIn ALANGARA we try to offer the players as much freedom as possible to live out their roleplay fantasies and dreams, as long as those things cannot and will not be �abused� to powerplay. As such we do not offer different subraces as in many systems these are mostly used to make whatever class more powerfull. However we do offer a 100% freedom if it is pure roleplay and if a player decides that do indeed like ALANGARA and �sticks around� we are more than willing to change their apearance to whatever they would like. As such if a group of players should decide to make a great arcane ritual to turn themselves into trolls, giants, beholders or whatever would make their day we will happily accomodate such an apearance change, and the custom land/housing options even allows for them to over time build an intire society with areas, vendors, homes and guards etc. You can simply said, rest asure that those who �gives to the community� will find the staff extremely giving in return \n\nWhere gods are born�\n\nThis is not just a title, it is a part of the intire worldsetting. In ALANGARA players who have reached level 40 � which is a hard journey � can be reborn as level one again but greatly boosted compared to normal mortal beings. This option have been achieved and used by 2 players so far and as such those 2 are semidivine beings strugling to, over severel stages where Reborn is the first, become divine powers of the Inner Realms.\n\nwe hopefully Can keep up with this description\n\n","Rating":9.9,"Votes":12,"Awards":[]},"998":{"Title":"Pavella","Author":"Pavella Team","Submitted":20061007,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Hardcore Rules","Patch Version":"CEP-2.00 Requires Community Expansion Project","Website":"ttp://www.lone-gunman.org/?page_id=14","Number Players":"~20","Setting":"Fantasy","Length":"Open Ended.","Number DMs":"2","IPs":"TESTING NOW!

This is wear I will explain wear the world is within the age of despair, if you have read the book�s Basically the disk�s of mishikal have been retrieved by the original hero�s of the Lance an returned to the pople the old god�s are returning, But shortly after the return of the disk�s the hero�s Rastlin, Caramon. Flint Tasslhoff Have all vanished an know one has heard from them since The world is in turmoil an the dragon army�s are decimating krynn without heroes of good an evil the world will be destroyed. \n\nIt is unto you as Player�s to decide to join the side of good an fight for krynn an it�s people an there current way of life. Or choose the path of evil the army�s an such an help corrupt krynn in your quest for power an knowledge wealth an so on. \n\nWho will save or end Krynn. Will it be one of your faithful characters or will your name fade into the past.\n\nThe Age of Despair begins with the Cataclysm, and runs ca. 1 AC - 383 AC. Two time periods form the Age of Despair: the Time of Darkness (ca. 1 AC - 331 AC) and the Time of Dragons (ca. 331 AC - 383 AC). \n\nTime of Darkness \nThe fallout from the Cataclysm lasts for centuries. Plague and famine wrack the lands. Knights of Solamnia are unjustly persecuted as scapegoats. Lawlessness and banditry run rampant. The Seeker movement begins as people look to new gods. Beleaguered hill dwarves and humans attempt to gain entry to Thorbardin for food and begin the Dwarfgate War. The archmage Fistandantilus destroys both armies as well as the fortress of Zhaman, but disappears. The dwarven hero Kharas, sickened by the acts of his people, takes the Hammer of Honor and departs Thorbardin. He leaves a prophecy saying that no dwarf will rule Thorbardin without the hammer, which becomes known as the Hammer of Kharas. \n\nTakhisis brings the sunken Temple of Istar to the Abyss, and takes the temple's Foundation Stone to Neraka to be used as a gateway for her and her forces. The Temple of Neraka is created as a result. She secretly awakens the chromatic dragons before returning to the Abyss to gather her might. While Takhisis is away, Berem and his sister Jasla find the Foundation Stone. Berem, covetous of the gems on the stone, accidentally kills his sister, whose spirit takes up residence in the stone. A green jewel from the Foundation Stone embeds itself in his chest, granting him immortality. Takhisis cannot reenter Krynn until the stone is whole, and dispatches her forces to find it. The chromatic dragons steal the eggs of sleeping metallic dragons. Takhisis awakens the good dragons and secures a vow of noninterference in her war. In exchange, she promises to return their eggs at the war's conclusion. \n\nTime of Dragons \nTakhisis places her forces under the command of her Dragon Highlords. Evil creatures are drawn to the cause, and the Highlords ally with other nations to increase their might. Draconians are created from the captured metallic dragon eggs and used to bolster the Dragonarmies or to aid in finding Berem. As the Dragonarmies gather their might, the Companions pursue separate leads in search of the lost gods. \n\nThe Dragonarmies invade Balifor and Nordmaar in 348 AC, beginning the War of the Lance. Silvanesti is attacked; the elves flee to Southern Ergoth as elven king Lorac Caladon attempts to repel the invasion with a dragon orb. His failure results in the corruption known as Lorac's Nightmare. The Dragonarmies continue their expansion and control much of Ansalon by 351 AC. The reunited Companions meet Riverwind and Goldmoon, whose Blue Crystal Staff proves the existence of the gods of Good. The Companions free refugees from Pax Tharkas, kill Dragon Highlord Verminaard, recover the Hammer of Kharas for the dwarves, and flee south. \n\nThe few remaining free nations send representatives to Whitestone Glade to discuss an alliance. The Companions rediscover dragonlances and retrieve the dragon orb from Silvanesti, which slows the forest's corruption. Theros Ironfeld and the Companions help form the new alliance. \n\nThe Golden General defends the High Clerist's Tower from the Blue Dragonarmy} with the help of Sturm Brightblade, who dies in battle against Kitiara Uth Matar, Dragon Highlord and a former Companion. Gilthanas, D'argent, and Cymbol infiltrate Sanction and discover the truth about the metallic dragon eggs. The good dragons, upon learning this information, enter the war with a vengeance. The Dragonarmies falter, and the armies of the Whitestone Council lay siege to Kalaman. \n\nThe Companions, now known as the Heroes of the Lance, discover Berem and head to Neraka to reunite him with Jasla and the Foundation Stone. Berem sacrifices himself to free Jasla and reunite the gem as Tanis Half-Elven kills Duulket Ariakas, leader of the Dragon Highlords. The Temple of Neraka explodes, and the dragonarmies fight for their own power. The War of the Lance ends. \n\nRaistlin Majere enters the Tower of Palanthas and is declared the Master of Past and Present. Good and evil dragons withdraw from the fighting. The Dragonarmies occupy much of Ansalon but are swiftly driven back by the Whitestone armies. The Knights of Solamnia proclaim their first Grand Master since the Cataclysm. Raistlin, along with his twin brother Caramon Majere, the priestess Crysania, and kender Tasslehoff Burrfoot, travels to the days of Istar to challenge Takhisis. Raistlin defeats Fistandantilus and, with Crysania, enters the Abyss. Kitiara Uth Matar, also known as the Blue Lady, rallies her forces and attacks northern Solamnia. Her army strikes at Palanthas with the aid of a flying citadel. The army is repelled and Kitiara is killed. Raistlin sacrifices himself to keep Takhisis from entering the Portal to the Abyss. \n\nLord Ariakan, a Dragonarmy prisoner of war, is released by the Knights of Solamnia. He receives a vision and begins forming the Knights of Takhisis. Two elves of different nations, Porthios Kanan and Alhana Starbreeze, marry in hopes of creating peace between their nations. Goldmoon and Riverwind unite the tribes of Abanasinia. Tanis and Caramon visit Storm's Keep and meet Steel Brightblade, son of Sturm and Kitiara. Tanis fruitlessly tries to warn the Knights of Solamnia, the Temple of Paladine, and the Wizards of High Sorcery about the Knights of Takhisis. Years later, the Wizards of High Sorcery attempt to assault Storm's Keep and are soundly defeated. Porthios ends Lorac's Nightmare but he and wife Alhana are exiled from the elven realms. The Knights of Takhisis begin their conquest of Ansalon, which frightens the few remaining Irda. The Irda break the Graygem and free Chaos, who destroys their island before retreating to gather his strength. Silvanoshei, child of Porthios and Alhana, is born. \n\nThe Knights of Takhisis occupy most of Ansalon within a month but before they can secure their lands, the return of Chaos heralds the start of the Chaos War. Fire Dragons, shadow wights, and other Chaos-spawned creatures attack the entirety of Krynn. Forces of good and evil alike are destroyed by the minions of Chaos. Lord Ariakan is slain and Takhisis withdraws her presence from Krynn. The Vision given to the Knights of Takhisis vanishes. \n\nReorx, with help from Palin Majere, Usha, and Tasslehoff, retrieve the broken pieces of the Graygem. The few remaining Knights of Takhisis join forces with their former Solamnic prisoners in mounting an attack against Chaos himself. Tasslehoff stabs Chaos in the toe, and Usha catches a drop of Chaos's blood in the Graygem. This is used as leverage to force Chaos to leave Krynn. \n\nThe gods supposedly agree to leave Krynn as well, but this is nothing more than a trick by Takhisis. Using the gods' fight with Chaos as a diversion, Takhisis consolidates her power and at the right moment, moves the entire world to a place where she can be the only god. She takes the guise of Fizban, an avatar of Paladine, and explains to Palin and Usha that the gods had to agree to leave Krynn as well. Both clerical and wizardly magic is gone. Takhisis tells Palin that another type of magic exists and that the Age of Mortals has begun, then she retreats to gather her strength and await the next phase of her plan.\n\nThis server has many interesting Script's an such to try and make it interesting we are currently in open beta an have a lot of area's around 400 level 1-35 is pretty much what we have atm we are a high gold but low magic world.. now when i say low i mean level restricted an such.

More specifically the module�s more than 400 areas stretch across the entirety of the Viscounty of Verbobonc, with its main city of Verbobonc located on the banks of the Velverdyva River and numerous scattered towns and hamlets, and far beyond into the surrounding lands � climbing west into the jagged peaks of the Lortmil Mountains, east into the depths of the Gnarley Forest, and south through the cairn-dotted Kron Hills into the ancient Welkwood and the fetid humaniod-infested Suss Forest. Also within this richly developed region lies the immortally infamous Temple of Elemental Evil and the familiar areas connected with that much loved classical AD&D scenario including the ruined moat house, the dark sorted town of Nulb, and the village of Hommlet with the Inn of the Welcome Wench. \n\nNot only does the setting of Greyhawk: Verbobonc (GreyNet) harken back to the earlier days of AD&D but that theme is carried through in the style of game play emphasized on the module. General game play as well as the continuing plotlines ran by our team of DMs focus on roleplaying and character development with a strong PnP-flavor. Characters start their adventuring careers at 1st level in the bustling city of Verbobonc and level progression is generally slow with the majority of one�s experience points being earned through taking part in the continuing plotlines ran by our DMs, lucrative roleplaying bonuses (earned both in-game and for forum posts which add depth to your character), the completion of personal quests, as well as in the crucible of combat. Characters will develop and mature over a lengthy period as they raise through levels 1 � 8, with those that attain levels above 9 - 12 being heroes in their own right, and any beyond 15th being the stuff of nearly living legend. Along with the emphasis on supporting a strong cast of player characters with intricate personalities and backgrounds, magic and the power of the Greyhawk deities remains in our module something at which to marvel. Persistent magic items are truly to be coveted as they are rare and wondrous things, being typically only awarded to characters by DMs in the context of an ongoing plotline or as a reward for the completion of a meaningful personal quest. Every level you gain, every enchanted or blessed item that you quest for, every chapter of your character�s life that you write will be truly a rewarding experience as you watch them develop into whomever you choose them to become! \n\nIf you like the sound of Greyhawk: Verbobonc (GreyNet) we invite you to visit our forum to learn more and most importantly to join us online (direct connect IP above or via Gamespy under the Roleplay channel) for some old-school AD&D inspired fun. A detailed knowledge of the World of Greyhawk is not necessary though it will add to your enjoyment of the module and we always wholeheartedly welcome new ideas, new points of view, and most importantly new gaming friends to our world!\n\nUPDATE 12/06: NEW CONTENT/ENHANCEMENTS ADDED\nA new required HakPak has been implemented, adding ridable horses, a tailoring system, a selection of new tilesets, and a whole host of new spells from 1e and 2e AD&D.\n\nUPDATE 05/07: NEW ENHANCEMENTS ADDED\nThe required GreyNet Helper Hakpak contains the first batch of many to come 1st & 2nd edition AD&D NWN converted spells including: \n\nStoneskin - now can only be cast on self, but confers immunity to crits \nDarkfire - now can only be cast on self (most abused spell in existence) \nFlame Weapon - see \"Darkfire\" above \nAcid Storm (Wiz/Sorc 6) \nCurse of Impending Blades (Clr/Ran/Dr 2) \nDisintegrate (Wiz/Sorc 6) \nGlitterdust (Wiz/Sorc/Bard 2) \nHaunting Tune (Bard 3) \nHeroism (Clr 3) \nLower Resistance (Wiz/Sorc 5) \nSpell Shield (Clr 2) \nTsarkon's Forcewave (Wiz/Sorc 4) \nLeomund's Secure Shelter (Wiz/Sorc 4) \nWall of Ice (Wiz/Sorc 4)\n\nUPDATE 07/07: NEW CONTENT ADDED\nA complete re-build and updating of the Village of Hommlet is underway (take a look at the screenshots!) and many news areas have been added in the regions of Welkwood and the Suss Forest!\n\nUPDATE 4/2010 - Server Officially Offline . . . thanks to everyone for the years of adventure!","Rating":10,"Votes":16,"Awards":[]},"1017":{"Title":"Impiltur - The Forgottem Kingdom","Author":"Tellenger","Submitted":20061122,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://impilturtheforgottenkingdom.yuku.com/[/url","Number Players":"1-20","Setting":"A remote location in the northern kingdom of Impiltur in the world of Faerûn of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.","Length":"Persistent","Number DMs":"5","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Light","Classes":"All classes are permitted with a few restrictions.

One will also find that Impiltur is a low magic arena in which powerful weapons and items are extremely rare.\n\nImpiltur - The Forgotten Kingdom is a hak free server open to any who enjoy good role-play and the opportunity to share in the development of the game world through their character's involvement.\n\nSome features of the world include:\n\n- 300+ custom tailored areas to explore\n- Scripted quests for low-level PCs\n- Modified 3E Crafting by Vulcano\n- Seamless transitions\n- Persistent banking & item storage\n- Fishing, skinning, & climbing skills\n- Useable herbs and flora\n- Full Faerûnian diety pantheon system\n- Languages\n- Persistent inns\n- Persistent mapping system\n- Persistent journals\n- Spell material component system\n- On going DM controlled plotlines\n- PCs can influence change through RP\n\nPleae stop by and have a look.\n","Rating":7.5,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"1019":{"Title":"Gamer's Retreat  CEP 2.1 Nordock","Author":"Ledtil, Kyuss Ryn ,Brando Baris, Cari,  Darc, Mystra , Richterm et. al","Submitted":20061212,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Epic","Patch Version":"CEP-2.00 Requires Community Expansion Project","Website":"url]http://com1.runboard.com/bgamersretreat[/url","Number Players":"24","Setting":"See description","Length":"PW","Number DMs":"5-6","IPs":"72.5.248.82:5121","Staff Requirements":"Not hiring.","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Classes":"All classes.

Although, this game can be played by a single player it is a very harsh environment for one to survive on ones own. This module starts out at the beginning of time in a prehistoric setting of a primitive fantasy world. The objective of the game is to evolve faster then your opponent to get the upper hand. The game begins with player characters being among the first humanoids on the planet. The game will go from there with the PCs exploring and discovering the world while creating history. This is a natural item based module. It's all about searching for raw items and then researching these items to see if you can discover an idea. An idea consists of how to change these raw materials into tools, weapons, and spells to further the progression of the humanoid evolution.\n\nThis game is great for organizing a clan to go out and fight other clans. Besides using brute force to defeat your opponent you also have a technology tree of ideas you can discover that will help make your clan stronger. With this technology tree your clan could be on the verge of being eliminated, but by discovering the right idea you could find your clan being one of the elite clans in the game. You will need to keep the ideas flowing though or else your opponent could surpass you on the evolutionary tree of success and possibly defeat your clan.\n\nAlthough there is quite a selection of animals in the game to help one to become an experienced warrior, there are many monsters awaiting discovery. At first, the monsters will be weak, but over time they will populate and become stronger. If you want, one can hunt down and try defeating a particular group of monsters; if you succeed you will eliminate that group of monsters from the game for a period of time. At which time they will regroup and start populating again.\n\nThis game provides many endeavors for one to undertake. One can build, mine, fish, farm, search for items, discover ideas to make new items, teach others your ideas, discover a trade, teach others a trade, swim, climb, swing from tree to tree, commune with the gods, become a clergyman, convert others to your faith, and even procreate.\n\nIf this game sounds interesting to you, I urge you to visit the game website at [url]http://75.160.202.138:9488.[/url] Under the FAQ link is a section on the different things you will want to take into consideration when creating a PC for the game.

Though, we only call it persistant instead of persistent because someone got lazy when they were creating the webpage and didn't feel like changing it from an a to an e. Though, the playerbase has been together about 4 years or so, tagging on new members as time went on.\n\nThe Lands of Fenmyr.\n\nYou might ask, why should I care? I don't know. Really, I don't, it's a game so I don't guess you should care!\n\nBut, for those of you that do care about games and persistant worlds, this one might be of interest to you. Granted, I'm not the GM and I just play on the module, so I can't tell you everything about it. But I can tell you what draws me into this module as a player. \n\n- The DMs actually involve every player that wants to be involved in the plots.\n- The DMs actually make USE of your backstory.\n- The plots are fairly frequent, and ninty percent of the time are very involving.\n- XP is not handed out through spending hours chopping away at crap. It's handed out becuse of your RP and from DM Plots.\n- Fully working and rideable horsies!\n- Free crafting! No IC reason why, just, free crafting!\n- Though I don't know the actual scripting behind it, there are a lot of unique scripts in the module.\n- The playerbase is incredibly friendly.\n- Freedom for the players. If you want to build a house? You can. If you want to become an uber lich of doom? As long as you have the reasons and RP to do so, you can.\n- Unique World - Basing itself off of Faerun due to the amount of players that come in that don't want to read about Fenmyr, Faerunians -are- allowed with their lore. Though, they'll know nothing about Fenmyr.\n- We have no plans to move to NWN2.\n\nAnd while I tell you about the pros, I should likely tell you the cons as well..\n\n- Those that don't RP won't have much fun here.\n- It's sometimes hard to play on the module as the playerbase can be inconsistant in their times, and it's not that large of a playerbase. (Thus why I'm advertising.)\n- No Spawns, if that's a con for you.\n- Uses CEP2 and CRAP Haks. That can be a con for modem connections. :\\\n- The sever IP address changes with every reset, as it's run with care by someone that plays and DMs with us. You'll find the IP on the message boards, which he updates.\n- We have no plans to move to NWN2.\n\nYou'll find the website here, though Madcat has apparently been editting it lately: http://underfusion.9meansno.com/fenmyr/\nAnd the forums here: http://fenmyr.proboards33.com/index.cgi\n\nIf you have any questions about the mod, or anything like that before you jump in, feel free to ask me here or ask around on the Fenmyr forums.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1039":{"Title":"The Four Dungeons","Author":"DM_Angel","Submitted":20070213,"Updated":20070213,"Category":"Dungeon Adventure","Patch Version":"Works on all versions","Number Players":"20","Setting":"The town of Ishlata","Length":"60 Dungeon levels plus outdoor areas","Number DMs":"1","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"1-40","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","Schedule":"24/7","Treasure":"High","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"All","Experience Rewards":"Moderate","Races":"All","PVP":"No PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Penalty not severe","Connection":"Cable","House rules":"See rules in Dungeon","Content Guide":"Everyone","Player Requirements":"People who like a good Dungeon Crawl","RolePlay":"Light","Description":"Adramelech the demon has taken over the quaint town of Ishlata.

If you find one post it on the forum - nwnlance.proboards22.com - under the Bugs thread, please.\n\nIf you're caught , you will be punished.\n\n-3. NPCs-\n---------------------------------------------\nShouldn't be killable BUT if they are, DON'T KILL THEM.\n\nWe are creating two towns , one good & one evil, which will allow player's to attack npc guards . Attacking npc's seem's to be something a lot of player's like to do. So, that's why these two new cities are being planned.\n\n-4. Casting Restriction-\n---------------------------------------------\nNo spell casting in Vastonia or any of her areas (the non-pvp areas). \nIt's scripted. 5th try lands you in jail.\n\n-5. Whining-\n---------------------------------------------\nWe like suggestions, ideas and constructive criticism. \n\nRemember we aren't here to hold your hand, we are here to provide you with a very entertaining environment.\n\nUse the forum for this, it's the best way to get an answer - nwnlance.proboards22.com -\n\n-6.

A DMs Word-\n---------------------------------------------\nA DMs word is final. \nJust accept it, we're not power hungry .\nBut we did make the server and all we ask in return is that players obey the rules. \nThis rule exists to settle disputes that would otherwise rage on for months.\nYou may ask for a DM meeting on your issue, if you feel so strong about a decision that was made.\nYou will need to request a DM meeting on the forum, each DM has their own thread section, so you can ask any of your choice for this meeting.\n\n-8.

Take a screenshot and post it on the forum.\nRemember no DM needs you to 'trade' over your items.\n\n-9. Being a Member of a Guild or Cult-\n---------------------------------------------\nA Player may...\n- Be in a Guild and a Cult of similar\nalignment or goals\n\nA Player may not...\n- Be in 2 Guilds \n- Be in 2 Cults\n\nIf you get caught breaking this rule , you will be banned from guilds forever. That includes you using two different log names.\n\nEach guild has it's own merchant that has item's that no other merchant has. These items are NOT be be given away to any player who is not in that guild. Every attempt will be made to 'TAG' these items with the guilds name. Any player found with these item's will loose them right away, and if the \"giving\" player is found out, they will loose all guild rights for a month in real time.\n\n\n-10. PvP-\n---------------------------------------------\nFights...\n- No killing Easy or Effortless players \nunless they use verbal or physical attack's first. That's right, sometimes a smart mouth need's to be slapped once or twice.\n\nChallenging and upwards are fair game.\n\nWe have provided a nice Arena for fight's, please use it if at all possible.\n\nDisarm...\n- No disarm stealing. \n- The disarmed player must pay a fee in \nexchange for the item. This does not apply to named 'GUILD' items, you must give them back, right away.\n- Fee based on the items SELL value.\n- Easy/Effortless DO NOT have to \npay this fee.\n\nPickpocketting...\n- If you're caught, expect retribution.\n- No using Timestop to pickpocket.\n- No Pickpocketting on area transitions.\n- Do not pickpocket easy/effortless \ncharacters.\n- can not be done in areas \"tagged\" no pvp, so you little thieves will need to find you a favorite spot to do your dirty work, but within the rules listed.\n\n11. Powerlevelling-\n---------------------------------------------\n- 5 level party limit.\n- No \"ploughing the way\" for lowbies.\n- No \"softening up mobs\" for lowbies to \nland the killing hits. Example of this is, standing there taking the attacks while the lower level player is doing the damage for exp points.\n- if your going to show a player around and they are not within the \"5\" level limit, they must be unarmed and may not attack any mob's or collect any of the loot.\nA DM can usually tell if you're intentionally assisting a lowbie. If he/she can't the lowbie will be asked to wait until you are sufficiently far ahead.\n\n-12. Boss Camping-\n---------------------------------------------\nNo Boss Camping. By ANY means - just standing there, logging off and back on later, using the rest portal, etc.\n\n-13. Spawn Running-\n---------------------------------------------\nIf you spawn it, kill it. DO NOT just run/walk/sneak/sanc through areas leaving the mobs alive.\n\n-14. Banned Items-\n---------------------------------------------\nAs the name suggests they're banned. It shouldn't concern newer character but older ones 'may' have such items on them. If a dm removes some items this is probably the reason why. All banned items will be replaced with newer versions. Have any doubts? See the next rule.\n\n-15. Complaints-\n---------------------------------------------\nShould you have a complaint, against a player or a DM, please follow these steps...\n\n- Don't argue or insult with the player \nor DM in question. It solves nothing, \nso do your best to keep a cool head.\n- Take any logs or screenshots you \ncan, you'll need them.\n- Send a pm on the forum to one of the\nfollowing...\n- DM Tombstone\n- DM Stalker\n- DM Phantomizer\n- DM Chip\n- DM Kezz\n- DM Blister\nand explain your case calmly.\nProvide links to screenshots etc.\n- Making a public post about it \n(especially if it's a dramatic one\nabout inhumanity you've been \nforced to endure) will result in the \npost being deleted. \nIt solves nothing.\n\nWe have addressed the most common areas here in the rules.

Others say the Nosseka or dragonkin had a major part in the great retreat. It might even be the dragons themselves controlling everything. For a thousand years the city of drekmoor has watched those that left never return, until now. Some brave souls have walked out the city gates. And they returned. With stories of other cities that survived. And rumors of the other old cities still are heard everywhere in drekmoor. \n\n\n\nThe realm is congregated in the cities.

OOC Bann\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOOC Bann\n\n\t\nSpecial Cases:\n1.) If a player finds an exploit and tells the DM's about it immediately then there is no punishment. If a player finds an exploit and does not tell any DM's and is later caught, then there punishment will be decided by cooperation. If the the player has full cooperation and tells us about the exploit, there is a 1-1 Bann. If the player does not have cooperation in telling us about the exploit, it results in a 3-1 Bann. If the player has no cooperation and does completely refuses to tell us about the exploit, this results in a Vault Wipe Bann.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSituations:\n1.) If there is an incident in which a player breaks the servers rules and the bann\nis uncertain, then the HDM is to summon all present DM's to the High Court (OOC court), if the HDM is not on, a DEV can take the HDM's place. If niether the HDM or a \nDEV is on then the DM is to jail the player until an official OOC court can commence. If the bann IS certain, and the player getting banned issues a court, the court must happen. If a court cannot happen at this time, the player is jailed until an official\ncourt can begin.\n\t\nHigh Courts:\nAt the beginning of the court, the HDM or DEV is to announce the incident to all the DM's in the court. DM's will ask questions for clarification. Once everyone knows the exact situation, a votiong will take place. If 60% of the overall DM's agree on one statement, than that statement is what will happen and the player's punishment will be determined.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPlayer Rules:\n1.) There is absolutely no OOC. Marking OOC text with // or any other symbol is no exception. The only time OOC is allowed is when the player makes an error, crash, mistake, etc. For example, �// crashed, // miss click�.\n\n2.) Crashing Ancient Realms is awfully regretful, and results in a permanent ban if caught crashing.\n\n3.) No hacking characters or giving character extra bonuses. Hacked characters will be detected by a filter and logged. Attempting to hack Ancient Realms can cause severe punishment.\n\t\t\t\n4.) Exploiting bugs is a special case. Finding a bug and reporting the bug to a DM results in no punishment. However if one is caught exploiting a bug, punishment will be determined.\n\n5.) Un-role-played PvP and unnecessary PvP will cause a temporary ban. Extreme PvP will result in questioning before punishment.\n6.) If one is awkward enough to cyber, one must do it away from other players and only if the other person agrees to role-play it.\n\n7.) Extreme language is not needed. It is very unnecessary and offensive to certain people.\n\nPunishment in Ancient Realms is very logical and reasonable. If the HDM or DEV decides to ban, the player can always ask for a court to further decide and change punishment. Unfair DM-ship can be reported to the HDM or any DEV.\n\nDM Rules\n1.) DM�s do not have permission to ban players. Banning is decided by the HDM or a DEV. DM�s do however have authority to jail players until the HDM or a DEV joins.\n\n2.) DM�s giving free XP / gold can result in losing their DM-ship.\n\n3.) DM�s are never to show their true appearance.\n\nDEV Rules\n1.) DEV disagreements are determined by majority. This overwrites rule #2.\n\n2.) All DEV�s have equal power and authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All are Premitted as long as your role play the classes acordingly to your race alginment and class this goes even more for sub-classes.","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"One threw Forty","Magic Level":"Moderate","Schedule":"24/7/365","Treasure":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Number Servers":"One for the moment in the future we intend to expand apon possibly three more.","DM Needed":"Multiple DMs required","Alignments":"The whole Shabam.","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Races":"There are multipul Races you may play all default bioware races are enabled.But we have have set up about twenty different sub races including vampire and beo-wulf but you must be bitten to play and this can only happen in a encounter with one of the two and theres a role for changing or not a will save.you will be given a option however.","PVP":"Full PvP","ApplicationReqs":"For players Nothing.\n\nDM's are a different story.","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"You will go into death.\n\nA plane Of darkness.You must wait to respawned but if you have died in the result of a player hostility it would be looked down apon to respawn to avoid capture etc.","Connection":"Mixed","House rules":"Look in Congress Above In staff requirments.","Content Guide":"Mature","Player Requirements":"You follow the rules\n\n1.No exsesive pvp\n2.no un-rpd pvp\n3.no ooc what so ever unless there is a error ooc such as,\"misclick\"\n4.if one is odd enough to cybor the two players must be concenting and must do it in a private or isoclated place preferably private\nSuch as everset in the middle of no where were the odds of people showing up is slim.Private being a home.","RolePlay":"Medium","Forums":"Coming soon!","Description":"Ancient Realms is A world recovering from a great Darkness.Many of the books discribing the great darkenss have been destroyed for all but one,Azroiels journal.With in it the information of the darkness is kept with in..What ever this darkness was.Someone wanted the memory gone.Forever...","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1049":{"Title":"Astoria Requiem","Author":"the admin","Submitted":20070320,"Updated":20070320,"Category":"Roleplay","Number Players":"A max of 40 our current player base is from 6-20 on at any moment and we have only been opened 2 weeks!","Setting":"Astoria Requiem is set on the island of Astoria In the Forgotten realms world. the city of Astoria has fallen (player done event) to the undead army of Vendril the mad ghost king of Astoria, the player take sides and battle for control of the island through RP and politics.","Length":"The Server is up 24/7","Language":"English","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All.","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"A player start up at level 4 if they have a open or locked subrace level 3","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"All","Races":"vampires, tanar'ri, baatezu, celestials, werewolves, werecats,werebear,wererats treekin, drow,Duergar & Half-dargons.

A horde of orcs sits poised in the Spine of the World, ready to pounce on a ripe northern civilzation ready for the plunder. Wizards from the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan plot to bring down the Confederation of the Silver Marches and replace it with their own form of government.\n\nWelcome to the Legacy of Netheril, a Neverwinter Nights Persistent World set in the Silver Marches and based upon the 3rd Edition D&D setting! Using material from various sources we have developed this module to be as accurate as reasonably possible, and we hope you enjoy it.\n\nThis module's scope of area covers the land from Yartar to the Lurkwood, and from Anauroch to Delimbyr Vale. From rolling hills to swampy marshes to deep forests to frigid mountains, a variety of villains and monsters stand ready to challenge your character.\n\nThis is a roleplaying server set to recreate the Silver Marches as close as possible thru the use of the Aurora engine.\n\nThis is the second incarnation of The Legacy of Netheril, originally created by Moonunit 921. Using what he learned by making the first version, he set out to improve upon his already promising module. During the construction of LoN V2, we moved the forums and password protected the server, but its now to the point that we are accepting new players.\n\nAnd during this time, we still kept our #18 listing on the top NWN Gameworlds list on NWVault\n\nI will remind you all that the server is still not completly done. There is still tons going into the module. Static quests with multiple outcomes, new dungeons, monsters and items are along the way also.\n\nLoN uses the latest version of the Players Resource Consortium, plus we are one of the few PRC PW's that have a working ConvoCC. We use the Community Expansion Pack V2, Alternate Combat Animations, Seemless Transistions, NESS (Random monster and loot generation), and our own custom haks, packaged as a single file and broken into seperate files for High speed and dial-up users.\n\nSome of the talented Community authors that have worked on the mod in the past and/or is working with us now:\nMoonunit 921: Community author, Expert builder/scripter, and all around good guy.\nFluffyAmeoba: PRC scripter, coding guru, and all around bug smasher.\nWojtekPod: CTP member, Community Content author.

And Remiston, capital city of the northern-most province of the Empire, is at the heart of it all.\n\nFrom the north, a plague flows, called the Taint. It corrupts all life it touches, whether plant, animal or human. But it appears directed; Tainted creatures band together for some unknown purpose, often giving into bloodlust and frenzy, falling on their fellows.\n\nFrom the east, tribes of orcs rampage the land. They seem to have little direction, and no overall leader, but if these tribes fall to the Taint, the Remiston Guard stand little chance of stopping them.\n\nAnd to the southwest, the crumbling Empire attempts to hold itself together, as politician battles politician with venomous words.\n\nRemiston, on the frontier, attracts heroes from all over the Empire and beyond. The Emperor grows old, and without a strong-willed successor, the Empire will disintegrate quickly. So he watches for heroes who prove themselves worthy.\n\nThe server is intended to be a mostly roleplay environment. Non-roleplay is allowed, but to rise to positions of power, the player will need to be a proven roleplayer.\n\nGuilds will feature heavily, each one player-run. The guildmaster will have a reasonable amount of power over his guildmates, but will also have a lot of responsibility. Many of the guilds have political standing within the city, and he will be expected to represent his guild effectively. All guildmasters are expected to be elected democratically by his guildmates, with elections held every month. Each guild will have its own treasury that anyone can put money into, but no-one can take from directly; this money is used by the builders, who charge for guild upgrades, like new rooms, merchants, items... anything, really, as long as it's for the guild (rather than specific individuals).\n\nThe Guildmasters of applicable guilds (The Hive, the group dedicated to general scum, will of course have no influence, but they get other benefits...) will be able to influence the decisions made city-wide. Some guildmasters will have more votes than others, or will have other political benefits; for example, the Guild of Nobles (working title; they're not exactly a guild as such...) will be able to have two people on the council. The General (leader of the Guild of Warriors) will have more votes than the leader of the University. The council will have a treasury, similar to the guilds, which they can use for the whole city.\n\nThere is also, of course, a large area around the city for general adventure. Goblin caves, ruined castle, the city sewers... all the usual stuff. The quests are not expected to be generic \"kill ten rats\" quests, although understandably there'll be a distinct lack of \"save the world\" quests.\n\nWe (or rather, I, at this stage) are looking for dedicated individuals to aid in creating this Persistent World. We need scripters, builders, DMs and general creative thinkers to create a PW to be proud of. No prior experience required, although it would be nice if scripters knew how to do the basics.\n\nAnd don't think I don't know my stuff. I've been playing with the toolset almost since NWN was first released. I already have the guild system set up (although only one guild exists, the framework is there, so more can be made quickly).\n\nSend me an email (via my profile) or post here to apply. I'll have a website for this soon, if I manage to get some other people interested...","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"1056":{"Title":"LOTR Version 20 PW","Author":"Tdough","Submitted":20070403,"Updated":20070404,"Category":"Roleplay","Number Players":"40","Setting":"Middle Earth","Number DMs":"3","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Non-existent","Classes":"All standard classes available.","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"1-60","Magic Level":"High","Schedule":"24/7","Treasure":"High","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Alignments":"Good or Evil","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","Races":"All","PVP":"Mixed","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Only XP is lost.","Connection":"Cable","House rules":"100% role play. \nUse // for non-role play.","Content Guide":"Everyone","Player Requirements":"No Tolkien names.

There should be a natural progression of terrain. While this is not always possible with the limited tile set, I make an effort to have the areas make sense.\n\nRivers were the main way to travel in the ancient world and trade routes grew along them, thus many towns grew out of trading posts along the river valleys. Zarbon, Trilus, and Olaf are examples of this type of town. Once you move away from the rivers you are traveling into the hinterland, which is often dangerous and unpredictable. You may meet nothing or something very, very bad.\n\nBesides rivers there were rudimentary roads. In my world most of the major roads, that do not follow rivers, which run mostly from the north to the south, go east/west. Travel along roads, contrary to many worlds, is very dangerous. Bandits frequently waylaid travelers especially in lawless times. This is such a time in my world. Road travel is highly dangerous and people congregate behind walled towns for protection. I do not consider pulling monsters into towns to be a bad tactic. In fact, the hero that runs away may live to fight another day.\n\nAnother feature of my world is enclaves. These are locations like Zanid (east) where goblins congregate. They have essentially staked out a piece of territory that is either too remote or too worthless for others to bother with. The kobold mines is another such area.\n\nI also try to follow some rules of monster ecology. Monsters, though limitless, don't always spawn in the same locations in the same numbers, or at the same time interval. This is not true of enclaves, but in the wild things are different. I use scaled spawns sparingly as they tend to be the nemesis of weak characters. I do have random spawns that can occassionally spawn fairly powerful creatures. So be careful.\n\nYou can almost always avoid encounters if you use caution and I don't have monsters spawning right on top of you, though some can spawn close by. Night is the most dangerous time. I don't really have to go into this much as many players are aware of how dangerous the night can be.\n\nIn the night nocturnal creatures have the advantage so they tend to hunt at these times. Be aware that you are being hunted. This is hard to do within the constraints of the game but my world tends to be much more pro-active than most. Even I get surprised sometimes because of the random spawns. Be prepared to run to safety wherever you travel.\n\nAt low levels almost everything you run into can kill you. There are no easy battles, except maybe the mad crows and even they can blind you. Things are usually a lot tougher than you might expect. This is by no means a cruelty to the player. It's just the way things are in this world.

The resulting conflagration that war saw the fall of great empires and the consignment of Bocrewg, the god of Chaos, to the depths. He is now stirring once again with the help of Nebdezar, the god of death, he plans to lay claim to the world. This compact of evil is threatening the very structure of the world civilization and the other gods must respond. They, the so called good gods, still adhere to their original compact and are seeking heroes to act in the world as their surrogates.\n\nVarious political faction are also vying for control and are in continual conflict.\n\nPlayers can chose to join various political factions based on their alignment or they can attempt to remain neutral in the coming war.\n\n","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"1062":{"Title":"Alangara","Author":"Tarashon and Drakaen","Submitted":20070430,"Updated":20070430,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Works on all versions","Number Players":"40","Setting":"The Inner Realms","Length":"Forever","IPs":"74.1.243.61:5122","Staff Requirements":"We are looking for development aswell as DMs","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Classes":"In Alangara we have taken many steps to balance the player�s options no matter what class and or combination they choose.

We only force Role-play to the extend that players should speak as if they were indeed that character when in public. \n\nThe main philosophy from the two world builders/owners was that they wanted to create a server where it is the life and option of the players themselves that is in focus. Now we have designed a very challenging world. We believe that good role-play should be encouraged by the world itself by allowing the players to actually have some �real issues� to role-play about. As such we offer various options such as�\n\n- Player built housing.\n- Player built lands.\n- Even player built cities � if you can afford it�\n- Player made guilds with custom guild structures, teleports guild vendors etc.\n- Different in game factions to support of fight.\n- Lots of NPC quests to entertain you.\n\nPlayer farms adding a new range of options to the game such as:\n\n- Creating magical custom gear\n- Gain xp and gold from farming\n- Use special plants to get other sort of special gear adding to your personal power in combat\n\nAnother aspect we have been working a lot with is the entire atmosphere and user friendliness of the server. We have been working very hard to provide a host of different scenario�s in order to obtain a visually beautiful world which inspires the players to role-play and explore rather than forcing it down as a server rule. But keep role-play in mind when you make your character build or even your background.\n\nIn Alangara we try to offer the players as much freedom as possible to help out with their role-play, as long as it cannot and will not be �abused� to power play. If you have a very nice idea for a character build, but you are not sure about it, just contact a DM and he will try to help you much as possible. But players who �stick around� and want to change their appearance to whatever they would like, need to contact a DM so that we may change your character. Such things are mostly awards for good role-play. A person who �gives to the community� will find the staff extremely giving in return \n\nGuilds,\n\nYou can make your own guild on Alangara; there are a few old guilds from the previous server. These can be used for your guild, as there are already guild houses; Like the Arcane, people who want to set up a wizard/sorcerer guild can use this guild. When making a new guild, write a little story about your guild and what it does and send it to a DM or post it on the forum.\n\n\nFair play and team spirit�\n\nIn ALANGARA the main philosophy is that we should all have fun and treat each other with respect. This can be seen in many aspects of the world.\n\nAs for PvP we are indeed a PvP-server but none may attack another player without a very good and �continues over time� role-playing reason. In general PvP only occurs if both parties agrees upon it, since we all know that no one likes login on only to be �butchered� by a random high-level�this will be punished ( both parties) so the rule of PvP is:\n\n- Both parties should AGREE with it OOC, do this with a tell�\n- DON�T kill people in a city, if you do you will be jailed and depends on the city what punishment you get�a death penalty is possible.\n- When you are PvPed and you didn�t agree with it, DON�T log in with a high-level character to kill the guy, this will be a punishable offence. You just report it to a DM and when you are friendly, you will most likely get your xp and gold back.\n- When PvPed, your character avoids your �enemy� for a while, respawning and attacking him again isn�t allowed.\n\nAs staff we take player feedback very serious and truly do our best to accommodate the many and various requests we get. The only �drawback� is that cheating; exploiting and the like are highly frowned upon. If you find a bug, post it on the forum. Don�t exploit it, doing that and you will be punished. We do our best to accommodate all players� wishes but expect that the players in term show respect for the community and the staff\n\nOverall information of ALANGARA�\n\nALANGARA offers things like�\n\n- Custom housing, lands, cities and guild structures etc�\n- A well integrated teleport system including personal house teleports and expanded teleport availability for guilds.\n\n- Scores of NPC quests.\n- Tons of custom designed items and the ability to create personal items for all classes.\n- Personal Farm availability and fishing places \n- All monsters custom-made including a great deal of �boss monsters� (boss monsters have a real name to separate them from the normal monsters)\n- An open staff you can actually talk to and who will listen to your ideas. \n- A chance to develop your character beyond the standard scale of NWN.\n\n\n- A world where you can really make many of those Role-play ideas of yours come true or simply enjoy the big challenge of the monsters, requiring not only group effort but also a good strategy at the highest levels.\n\nThe thing that makes a server a good server isn�t it features; no it is the player base and the community. \n\nI hope that if you are looking for a place to live out those �medieval fantasy dreams� that you will consider Alangara, and that we as a community in term will not disappoint you.\n\nThe server is located on the Roleplay list as Alangara\nOr you can direct connect at IP 74.1.243.61:5122\n\nThe signs in OOC should tell you most of what you need to know or you may also visit the Forums \n\nDon�t be shy I will be checking this forum regularly and will be happy to answer any questions, and listen to any feedback�\n\n\nThank you,\nThe Alangara staff\n\nOriginally build by Tarashon\nNow ran by Drakaen","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"1063":{"Title":"Kymlun","Author":"Glortor","Submitted":20070501,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"url]http://forum.kymlun.com/[/url","Number Players":"22","IPs":"kymlun.com:5122\nnwn.panikk.org:5122\n","Forums":"Link","Description":"Original World, with its own Gods & Cities.

After a two year war the forces of the Triumvurate and the independent nation of Elisbar were succesful in forcing the invaders back to there homeland. The rampant Draco armies however uncovered several ancient fortresses and temples long forgotten in the mountains of Kalimvar and Elisbar. In one such fortress there was found a library that mentioned an island to the North that was the home of the Renmants of the Elven Que-Thalan empire and the Dwarven Clanholds of the Legendary Gemdragon clan who were famous for there rich ore and cratsmanship. The text said that both the Elves and the Dwarves sought isolation from the Humans who had arrived form the west and they created a Artifact named the �Decieving Eye� which clouded there entire Nation in a thick mist that not ship could pass through. \n\nTwo years ago the mist mysteriously dissipated and the Kalimvaran Government still reeling from the war sought to captialize on this and so they started the Colony of New Carsis. The elves and Dwarves seemed to have placed more wards then the mist upon the waters surrounding there island however and of the 12 ships sent only 5 made it. The colony was established regardless and another town Deepriver was founded to the north near the famed Uzmor mines also mentioned in the document found in the abandoned temple. The expense of running New Carsis proved to much for the Government of Kalimvar and New Carsis and Deepriver were left to fend for themselves. \n\nThe only people that travel to Grimwood now are adventurers seeking the riches that the renmants of the ancient Elven and Dwarven Civilization most assuredly contain. Many attempts have been made to make contact with both the Elves and the Dwarves but it has been yet unsuccesfull many assume that both have vanished form the land though the cause of there dissapearance is unknown. \n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1073":{"Title":".hack//RETURN Project G.U.","Author":"otherhand","Submitted":20070527,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"url]http://dothackgunwn.proboards40.com/index.cgi[/url","Number Players":"Looking for more","IPs":"68.94.21.202:5121","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","Treasure":"Dependant on Player's efforts","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Player's efforts","PVP":"Mixed","Vault Type":"Server","RolePlay":"Heavy","Description":"Ever wanted to play 'The World'? \n\nNow you can.\nJoin us at the .hack//Return project for RP, DMed events, PvP, quests, you name it, in 'The World R:2'.

After leveling, you join a team, either Roshnak or Aniel. This takes you to the battle area, where you buy equipment. After your done purchasing gear, you go outside of base into the battle. At the heart of the base, there is the Dragon, two guards and five elite defenders. Once you leave the base, there are three roads. NPC troops are always traveling down these roads, to attempt to kill the enemy dragon. There are also four defenders on each road, two at the start, and two near the center. Once you get to the second set of defenders, you will notice that your troops, are meeting up with the enemy troops, just past where you are. Just beyond that point, there are the enemy defenders. You must kill the little troops and level up, in order to become strong enough to kill the enemy defenders, elite defenders, guards and finally the dragon. After a dragon is killed, the module reloads, and everyone starts at level four again. Weapons are upgradeable, buffs can be purchased by classes we deem non caster and troops can be upgraded by the general of the army. One round usually takes around 90 minutes.\n\nOne side feature (amongst others) is that at the beginning of each round, you may vote on if you would like an Epic Level 20, Epic Level 40, or normal round. An epic round gives you 5,000,000 gold and levels you to the aforementioned level. The dragons also become plot for 30 minutes when one of these rounds are activated.","Rating":10,"Votes":25,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"1079":{"Title":"Kharlindale Realms","Author":"Kharlindale_Reger (aka Regermortis)","Submitted":20070619,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Epic","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://www.kharlindalerealms.com/[/url","Number Players":"35","Setting":"Kharlindale, created by Regermortis","Number DMs":"3","IPs":"65.7.149.56:5121","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Classes":"All","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"1-40","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Schedule":"24/7","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"All","Races":"All","PVP":"Party PvP","ApplicationReqs":"None","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Standard penalty of 50xp/level and 10% of your gold (but people will usually come res you if you wait a few minutes).

The Basics \n\nThe setting is in the world of Korrick. Korrick is a custom world and has no affiliation or relation to other D&D campeign settings, including Forgotten Realms. The Forgotten Realms deities, important characters, subraces, places of note, and etc. simply do not exist in Korrick. Korrick is a medium sized world, and is spherical in shape (much like the planet earth). The server is set on the continent of Durik and does not extent beyond said continent. Please feel free to RP that you are from another contient, make up names, settings etc. for your home continent if you wish. The majority of Durik is ruled with an iron fist by The Empire. The lands of Durik outside of the safety of the Empire's rule are full of danger and death. Non-Imperial lands are all claimed by creatures and monsterous beings with little tolerance to tresspassers. Most struggle to survive in Durik, trapped between the tyranny of the Empire and the dangers of the wilds. \n\n2. Magic \n\nDurik is a semi-low magic continent. The magic of Durik seems to be fading slowly, and has been for some time. The occurance of magical items of great value has dwindled. Some magical items have even been rumored to weaken or lose some of their magical properties over time. Spells in Durik are slightly weaker than if they were cast on other Continents. This is all due to The dark magic used to create races of The Horde. \n((This is a semi-low magic server. Expect that +1 is uncommon, +2 is rare, +3 is unique, +4 is unheard of except in fairy tales, and +5 is simply non-existant. There have been a few slight changes to some spells, please note the spell changes sign in this room for info.)) \n\n3. The Empire \n\nThe Empire rules almost all civilization beyond the lairs of The Horde. The Empire is ruled by an emporer who has little tolerance for those unwilling to bend to Imperial rule. Thousands of years ago, Durik was ruled by many kingdoms and races. But Durik was flooded by terrible evils and countless hordes of monsterous beings refered to as The Horde. The Horde crushed all of the ancient civiliazations, leavng them in ashes. Much of the cultural history once heald dear to the elves, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes of Durik was lost and left to ruin. In the midst of the destruction The Mighty Empire was born from the ashes of the old ways under the rule of Emporer Marcus Haldrin IV. The Empire bacame and still remains the only form of civilization with the might to survive the growing and ever present theat of The Horde. Racism is all but non existant in today's world as such ideals and cultures have been a forgotten part of ancient history for thousands of years, and The Empire has made an active attempt to destroy segregation by race and replace it with segregation by social class. The Empire enforces tyranny on it's people, and demands obedience from all under it's rule. The Empire brings harsh consequneces onto those whom break or defile Imperial Law. \n\n4. Nobility \n\nThe Emporer employs three levels of Nobility within The Empire: Dukedoms, Countships, and Baronries. A Duke/Dutchess holds responsibility and domain over two Counts/Countesses, which in turn hold responsibility and domain over three Barons/Baronesses. Barons/;Baronesses are appointed by Counts/Countesses, and Counts/Countesses are appointed by Dukes/Dutcheses. For more information on Nobility see the sign labeled Nobility FAQ. \n\n5. The Horde \n\nThe Horde is a term used to refer to the massive numbers of ceatures and monsterous beings on Durik. Races of The Horde include anything found in monster spawns. The Horde is created by their twisted dragon masters using dark and ancient magic. The magic used to create members of The Horde sucks the very magic and essence out of the surrounding environment, natural and fabricated things alike. Creatures of The Horde are forged into full adulthood, cannot reproduce themselves, and are created subserviant to their dragon masters. The Horde do not have children, a difference of gender, or any true ecology to speak of other than the desire to serve their dragon masters. They are born of and are fueled by foul destructive magic and do not eat, drink, sleep, void, or have bowel movements. They are however mortal, and they breath, bleed, and die much like other humanoid races.\n","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All standard classes permitted with some limitations.  The following are our charcater class build rules as posted on our forums:\n\n1. MULTICLASSING: You must take at least 3 levels of every class you take before reaching level 20. No taking new classes after level 20. \n\n2. SKILL POINTS: You are required to spend all/most of your skill points on level up. It is admissible to save a maximum of 2 skill points as we understand how the world of skill points does not always filter out evenly. If you are caught with more than 2 extra skill points sitting around you may be asked to re-level your characters last level to rectify the problem. \n\n3. CHAMPIONS OF TORM: A Champion of Torm will be considered a \"catch all\" champion of any god of your choosing within the pantheon. So for instance, if you take Champion of Torm and your deity is Bardaus, you will actually be a Champion of Bardaus. All characters that take levels of Champion of Torm are required to follow and set a deity. You may set or change your characters Deity by speaking with the Deity Setter in the OOC Entry. \n\n\n4. PALADINS & CLERICS: You are required to pick and RP following a deity with a paladin or cleric character. Details on the pantheon can be found on the signs in the Information Room, or by using your Character Manager Tool. Paladins must follow a deity that is of one of the following alignments: Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral. Clerics must follow a Deity that is close to their own alignment. Here are the restrictions as per Deity Alignment: \n\nLawful Good Deity = Cleric must be any Good Alignment or Lawful Neutral, \nNeutral Good Alignment = Cleric must be any Good Alignment or True Neutral, \nChaotic Good Deity = Cleric Must be any Good Alignment or Chaotic Neutral, \nLawful Neutral Deity = Cleric Must be any Lawful Alignment or True Neutral, \nTrue Neutral Deity = Cleric Must be any Neutral Alignment, \nChaotic Neutral Deity = Cleric Must be any Chaotic Alignment or True Neutral, \nLawful Evil Deity = Cleric Must be any Evil Alignment or Lawful Neutral, \nNeutral Evil Deity = Cleric must be any Evil Alignment or True Neutral, \nChaotic Evil Deity = Cleric must be any Evil Alignment or Chaotic Neutral. \n\nYou may set or change your characters Deity by speaking with the Deity Setter NPC in the OOC Entry room. If at any time your character's alignment changes from your required alignment to be playing a cleric of your chosen deity, you will be offered a character rebuild to remove your cleric class or you may continue to play your character without the ability to cast spells until such time you have repented and become the appropriate alignment again. \n\n5. CLERIC DOMAINS: You MUST choose your domains from the list of your chosen deities domains listed on the signs pertaining to the Pantheon in the Information Room. Any and all clerics are permitted to take the domains of earth, air, fire, and water. Breaking this rule will get your character deleted. \n\n6. PRESTIGE CLASSES: Prestige classes are supposed to be a representation that your character has shown exceptional dedication to certain skills, abilities, or aspects of their lives. Because of this, each character is allowed to take only one prestige class ever. Also, we expect to see good roleplaying of prestige classes. We understand that some prestige classes are easier to roleplay than others, but try to give it some effort. We don't want to see a dragon disciple running around saying \"Oh yeah, I'm part dragon\". Give it some history and try to make it a part of your characters lifestyle. By DM permission only, will a character be permitted to have more than one prestige class. To obtain permission post a request to the Applications Forum. Include your account name, character race and classes desired, a brief character history and idea, make it good, make it detailed. \n\n7. RED DRAGON DISCIPLE: This class is currently unmodified but is caped off at level 9. You will not be allowed to take more than 9 levels of this prestige class. In addition, RDD's do not receive wings at level 9. \n\n8. SHADOW DANCER: The Shadowdancer HIPS ability has been set up to be useable only once every three rounds. Attempts to enter stealth mode too early will automatically kick you out of stealth mode, and apply a large penalty to your hide and move silently skills for a short time.\n","Tricks & Traps":"Light","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Alignments":"All Standard","Races":"All Standard Races","Content Guide":"Teen","Forums":"Link","Description":"A Roleplaying Persistent World currently in it's Beta Stages.

It caters to already an average of 6-13 players. And it's been up a mere 3 Months. Now, when I say modern, I mean its a 100% unique to itself player-ran PW!\n\nOur Trailer can be found here:\n\nLink\n\n\n\nThe realm offers already roughly 40 jobs, which you can apply for. Without a DM! A System which lets you build your own houses. There is a real-estate system where you can buy pre-made houses. There is a 100% persistent functioning bank system, which you can access via a Social-Security card, which means anyone that acquires this card can get into that account. It also offers many unique and flawless(most of the time) systems scripted by our Administrator Chass.\n\nNow, perhaps you've played Isandor I for awhile? Well, If you've played there, you know that the players LITERALLY run the world, and you get 95% freedom-of-choice, the other 5% is the subraces which are too overpowering to let you have(Without Making A Poll For Them! ).\n\nXenograph still uses the standard NWN classes though, seeing as we still want our daily dosage of Fantasy to Xenograph. And also because Xenograph is not ONLY a Modern persistent world, it contains TWO planets. Maultare, and Loren. One is the modern world, the other is the fantasy-medieval!\n\nYou can play almost any character you want.\n\nYou can make anything you want.\n\nYou can DO whatever you want!\n\nAnd we update the realm almost DAILY! So that we can offer you the BEST role play experience!\n\nDidn't I mention you cant just get levels by killing stuff? Nope, you cant. XP Is only gained via events, and RP.\nXp is handled this way as to offer we dont get power levelers, and so we can call Xenograph(and Isandor) one of the GREATEST servers there is for constant player/DM-RP!! Literally, ALL of our current players RP, and they don just\n\n*kicks the guy in the leg* They *He grunts, flushed in anger, Swinging his bute of a leg towards the laughing convict, Smacking him square on in the shin. Leaving the convict to whimper in his new found pain* Wat, thats Wrong! It's more like this! *The man atempts to swing his brute of a leg at the convict, attempting to stop his laughing, and replace it with a dosage of pain* The player rolls the proper dice checks(via the PC Dice Bag) the convince rolls a dodge. SUCCESS *the brute of a man kicks the convict in the shin, leaving him to whimper in pain*\n\nAlso, Maybe you DON'T have HotU expansion, well, Xenograph dosen't use HotU. allowing it to give a greater range of play to fellow NWN'ers.\n\nWe also have a state of the art bug-tracking system, this system ensures that all bugs found are simple and easy to report, and simple and easy to fix!\n\nXenographs Webpage: Link\nXenographs IP: isandor2.servegame.com:5121\nXenographs Forum: Link\n\n-----------------\n\nI hope you've put some interest into Xenograph Arms!\n\noh, and the haks required to play this realm are located at the Forum. We dont use only the d20mm, we use xeno's own custom haks, plus some other great hak files.\n\n\nAnother quote from another player:\n\nIt is true that this server uses alot of haks. But I can guarantee, That if you like quality roleplay, a new lifely setting and a decent set of rules to promote roleplay and sovereinity, then they are certainly worth it! This high quality roleplay server has a great and friendly atmosphere. It has many secrets, social aspects and systems to explore. Including constructing your own placables, crafting systems and work stations.\n\nBecome part of a large space organization, police department or make your own restaurant or bar and sell your drinks. The sky is the limit in this sand box realm. And with sky I mean the illiteral sky box of the nwn settings. Though the limits may be somewhat in the orginal settings, persistence is a great aspect that gives more life to a world than a mere \"Container\" for your characters.\n\nWork not only on your character, but also on the world around you. Make friends, enjoy work, many Dungeon Master run events and a large amount of freedom. Make your own races, your own deities and create your character to your hearts content.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1114":{"Title":"Skull Ball ","Author":"DuckyDoom","Submitted":20071018,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Other","Patch Version":"CEP-2.00 Requires Community Expansion Project","Website":"url]http://skullball.forumup.com/[/url","Number Players":"0-20","IPs":"192.168.1.100:5121","Description":"The idea itself is based on the game Blood Bowl, made by Games Workshop.

One that sends the entire Eastern Coast into a frenzy of meat craving flesh ripping zombies. This is Outbreak Modern...\n\nOutbreak is a premiere modern module that is set in a city called Ether City, Georgia in the USA, in a post-apocalyptic state after a biological attack involving a major viral outbreak. This outbreak has caused reanimation in the dead, turning regular innocent citizens into blood thirsty flesh craving monsters. The only thing that you can do is find what supplies you need, and try to survive. Whether you try to survive in the city with other people as a team, or go it alone is your choice. Outside safe-zones and safe-houses the chance for death or infection dramatically increases, but you must go out at some point or another to search for supplies required for survival. \n\nThe module takes persistency seriously, and as a character there are things that you can do in game that will carry that persistency. Actions as teams or as individuals can caused changes in the design of areas, attitudes of NPCs, survival rates, and many, many more things. \n\nWe encourage you to RP accordingly as you would in a real-life situation as the module is based on what would happen if this was real. It is a simulation of an actual biological attack of this nature, similar to those that you would find in the games of Resident Evil. \n\nOur team above all tries to create the feeling and atmosphere of hopelessness, distress, fear and suspense. We create the feeling that while doing what you can to survive, one little thing could end it all for you. Keeping the suspenseful sequence and high quality RP a top priority, you are sure to be kept on the edge of your seats. \n\nThe purpose of this mod is to create the illusion that this is the real world, and hence create the feeling that you are there. All of our players are expected to roleplay as if this -were- the real world in America. We are constantly growing daily as this Genre becomes more popular, and adding more and more options things to the mod with every chance we get.\n\nLink\n\nSee the forums for more information, rules, and hak packs.

Vários povos diferentes habitavam parcelas distintas do continente, cada um preocupado com sua própria sobrevivência, consolidando fronteiras e disputando recursos naturais. Diz-se que nesse tempo, nem mesmo o E�rtonil era falado ainda e que por isso, os povos eram incapazes de se entender. \nSegundo a tradição, foi nesse tempo em que surgiu a figura conhecida como o Grão-duque Balador Felixciano De Pradus, ou simplesmente, O Unificador. Oriundo de uma pequena vila de pastores conhecida como Pradus, Balador iniciou sua carreira como soldado, ou algo assim, na milícia local para proteger os rebanhos de ladrões, nômades e das hordas de Goblins que sempre viveram espalhadas por E�rton.\nO entremeio da história é um tanto obscura, cheio de partes conflitantes e teorias fantasiosas, mas se tem certeza de que em um determinado ponto de sua carreira, Balador teria se tornado o comandante-em-chefe do poderio militar local e expandido o controle de sua pequena vila ao subjugar ou pacificar povos que antes ameaçavam os pastos de Pradus. Foi nesse ponto que, ao que tudo indica, a cidade deixou de ser apenas uma pequena vila de pastores e floresceu como um centro comercial e de idéias, ampliando seus ideais e seu conceito de civilidade e honra. Pela primeira vez, ao menos na história registrada, E�rton teve algo que realmente se parecia com uma civilização.\nApesar de Marechal das forças de Pradus, Balador não era um homem inteiramente de guerra. Sua astúcia, combinada ao coração ingênuo de um pastor, permitiram que ele firmasse alianças e tratados, estendendo a influência de Pradus e suas colônias e protetorados cada vez mais longe em E�rton. Seu maior feito foi a �aliança da folha d�ouro�, quando um tratado formado com os povos élficos de Sylvanus garantiram acordos comerciais importantíssimos para a economia de ambos os povos e introduziram, pela primeira vez em E�rton, os exóticos artefatos místicos de manufatura élfica.\nNo entanto, um revés alterou o curso da vida de Balador, terminando num desfecho que certamente tornou a face de E�rton o quê é hoje. Até então, o Marechal de Paradus não passava disso. Um simples marechal com um título de fidalguia. Mas seu sucesso era tão estrondoso e suas realizações tão impressionantes para seu tempo que ele acabou por despertar a inveja da pessoa mais improvável: seu próprio rei e senhor.\nO rei Demetrius II vinha de uma longa linha de comerciantes que acabou por, paralelamente, assumir o governo de Pradus, apenas um vilarejo de pastores. A chamada �casa real� mal se comportava como tal, uma vez que a pompa e as práticas de uma corte jamais tiveram lugar em uma sociedade tão simples. Demetrius e seus familiares se dividiam entre pequenos julgamentos e benfeitorias locais e os negócios privados da família. Mas após a ascensão de Balador, eles passaram mais e mais a gozar de riquezas e luxos. Demetrius então pôde trocar seu antigo título de Burgo-mestre pelo de rei de Pradus e de seus protetorados e sua carreira teve uma nova dimensão, nomeando burocratas, nobres e governadores e tendo um poder político com o qual ele nunca havia sonhado.\nMas com o passar do tempo e o aumento dos sucessos de Balador, o rei percebeu uma realidade inexorável: seu marechal era muito mais influente, conhecido e amado por seu povo do que ele mesmo. Para Demetrius, isso era uma condição insuportável! Saber que os bardos faziam canções para Balador e não para ele, o gelava a alma, por achar que o marechal seria eterno e ele, uma mera sombra por toda a eternidade.\nOs detalhes do que ocorreu em seguida são mais um hiato na história de E�rton, mas parece que o rei Demetrius II usou a ganância dos anões de Goignar a seu favor, criando um acordo comercial que, em troca, os anões criariam uma armadilha, aprisionando o Marechal Balador para sempre nos subterrâneos. O rei, então, enviou seu marechal e sua comitiva para a armadilha, sob o pretexto de uma inspeção sobre as condições das minas de Goignar.\nO desenlace dessa trama tem várias versões, mas Balador não só conseguiu escapar de sua prisão no subterrâneo como desvendou todo o plano. Retornando imediatamente para Pradus, ele encontrou o rei reunido com seus nobres, reorganizando o reino e tomando para si próprio o cargo de marechal e ordenando a alteração dos registros, para que o nome de Balador fosse esquecido da história. Quando o Marechal encontrou seu senhor, os nobres podiam deduzir perfeitamente o que havia acontecido. Um acalorado debate facilmente se tornou violento e culminou naquilo que foi apara sempre lembrado como �A noite do papel rubro�, quando todos os documentos foram manchados com sangue da luta que pôs fim ao governo de Demetrius e seus parentes. Nessa mesma noite, Balador foi aclamado pelos nobres que o apoiaram como o novo governante de Pradus, os conspiradores que ajudaram o rei foram executados e seus descendentes removidos dos privilégios da nobreza ou da casa real e postos na rua.\nA primeira providência de Balador Felixciano De Pradus foi extinguir a posição de rei e se declarar Grão-duque de Pradus e Supervisor de E�rton, conseqüentemente com isso dando a todos os regentes das cidades aliadas o título de duque do reino e membros permanentes de sua corte. Criou ainda a �ordem da folha rubra�, uma entidade com membros escolhidos e gestionados por ele para espionarem as intenções e humores de todos os povos e governantes de E�rton. Com essas manobras, o Grão-duque não só renovou a lealdade e o prestígio dos nobres mais próximos a ele, como garantiu uma vigilância constante sobre futuras conspirações e ainda colocou os governantes e pessoas importantes dentro de sua própria corte, lhes dando um status reconhecido por todo o continente e aumentando sua importância pessoal.\nE�rton estava unificada quase que inteiramente, à parte apenas por alguns povos e tribos isoladas, com as quais tinha que negociar politicamente. Mas enfim, Pradus era o grande reino de E�rton, Balador era Pradus e Pradus era E�rton. Todos sob um único reino próspero.\n\n \n\n\n\n O erguer da chama\n\n Durante 312 anos a dinastia de Belador prosperou, governando E�rton dentro dos princípios de seu fundador, buscando retalhar os atacantes e fazer acordos e pactos com o maior número de vizinhos, aceitando todos aqueles que quisessem participar de seus ideais. Mas há cerca de 140 anos atrás, durante o reinado de Lorde Gilbert Felix Antony - descendente direto de Lorde Belador Felixciano de Pradus - e Grão-duque legítimo de E�rton, que uma era de trevas que perdura até hoje começou.\nO arquiteto da ruína de E�rton era um jovem cavaleiro da �Ordem do papel rubro� chamado Hagar Del�wither. Sua história foi, apesar de um tanto simples, muito conturbada. Filho de um dos cavaleiros da ordem, Hagar foi pajem de seu pai desde os 12 anos, quando teve a oportunidade de seu primeiro contato com o ofício que orgulhosamente queria abraçar, seguindo os passos de seu pai. Ao chegar aos 16, já estava oficialmente adotado como um cavaleiro em treinamento, mas os quatro anos anteriores já o haviam dado uma clara noção do que lhe seria exigido e, em menos de um ano e meio, o rapaz já era sagrado membro da ordem na catedral de Anthonieta, a nova capital fundada pelo pai do Grão-duque e nova sede do poder de E�rton.\nJovem e sagaz, Hagar era o mais ativo de todos os cavaleiros da ordem. Na verdade, ativo em demasia aos olhos de seus companheiros. Assim que pôde ostentar o símbolo da ordem e cavalgar com sua armadura, Hagar se dispôs a corrigir problemas, e para ele, bárbaros, ladrões e povos hostis eram o principal deles. Várias foram suas cruzadas pessoais contra tribos de goblins, desde as mais próximas aos centros urbanos até as mais distantes e escondidas de que teve notícia. Feras e animais perigosos também estavam em sua lista, e várias criaturas foram mortas por amedrontar, atacar ou meramente vagar próximas as áreas protegidas pelo Grão-duque e seus cavaleiros. Nuurds, gigantes e bárbaros eram inclusos em sua lista de tarefas, sempre tentando expurgar todas as populações que, a seu ver, poderiam ameaçar seu reino brilhante e a condição de E�rton.\nCom o tempo, as cruzadas de Hagar ficaram mais ambiciosas e o coração do já homem podia perceber um objetivo maior em suas ações. Ele se deu conta de que apenas combater pequenos bandos como um cavaleiro solitário não renderia nenhum benefício maior para o reino. A primeira providência de Hagar então, foi se aproximar dos nobres que lhe poderiam ser úteis em terras estrangeiras.\nUsando dessa nobre influência de seus novos amigos, Hagar começou então a trabalhar em terras distantes, povos e reinos não-aliados de seu próprio, buscando erguer uma reputação que pudesse fazê-los desejar integrar o Grão-ducado. Com o passar dos anos, ele percebeu que suas melhores ferramentas para fazer com que todos os relutantes se juntassem ao seu próspero reino eram o medo de que algo terrível acontecesse ou encontrar ele mesmo provas de que esses povos na verdade tinham a intenção de derrubar o governo estabelecido em E�rton e tomar a coroa do Grão-ducado.\n Mais uma vez, a história se torna nebulosa e perdida no tempo. Existem aqueles que argumentam que Hagar sempre teve intenções de conquista e que seu primeiro passo seria conquistar para seu governante para depois usurpar o poder. Outros têm ainda que as intenções do cavaleiro eram boas, mas sua visão equivocada. Esses acreditam que Hagar apenas queria estender todas as benesses de sua nação a todos os povos em E�rton e que os achava cegos ao não quererem se submeter às leis justas de Lorde Gilbert.\nSeja como for, os planos de Hagar continuaram em movimento: ele recrutou mercenários para atacar caravanas e rotas comerciais, pressionou políticos, financiou traições e revoluções em governos e armou tribos goblins para que atacassem os vizinhos do Grão-ducado. Sua cartada final e fonte de sua derrocada, no entanto, veio de um dos locais mais inesperados possíveis. Já havia anos que Hagar tentava de todas as suas estratégias para fazer os Jahal-zim, povo orgulhoso que vivia no Grande Arbi, a se render e se juntar ao Grão-ducado. Hagar havia enviado emissários, e subornado todos os que eram contrários ao Califa de Jahal-zim, sem obter sucesso. Todos os grupos mercenários que ele havia lançado contra eles foram rechaçados e mesmo quando ele moveu mundos e fundos para armas e direcionar os Nuurds contra o povo do deserto, os cavaleiros da areia foram capazes de fazer imensos sacrifícios para destruir um a um dos répteis de sangue frio que adentravam seu território.\nTomado por ódio e sem nenhuma ferramenta política que o ajudasse a colocar o Grão-duque e os nobres contra os Jahal-zim, Hagar decidiu então atacar com tudo o que tinha e depois encontrar algo que justificasse suas ações.\n No entanto, O Califa já havia recebido emissários de Allihanna que espionavam Hagar e monitoravam seus passos. Alertado sobre a posição do exército, ele organizou as defesas e preparou seus homens enquanto alguns de seus mais velozes arautos correram em direção à Anthonieta para tentar expor o plano ao Grão-duque.\n Na manhã do ataque, os mercenários de Hagar, misturados aos soldados e cavaleiros do reino, iniciaram sua terrível batalha. Apesar de o elemento surpresa haver sido perdido, o Cavaleiro Rubro contava ainda com o valor do treinamento e as poderosas armas do Grão-ducado. Se batendo contra os honrados guerreiros da areia e os velozes cavaleiros Mujahar, aquilo que havia sido planejado para durar apenas algumas horas, acabou se tornando uma batalha de dias. Os mal equipados Jahal-zim se batiam mais e mais contra os já cansados e famintos homens de Hagar, mantidos de pé apenas pelo desejo de vingança de seu comandante que tentava, saqueando e pilhando na retaguarda, suprir a falta de alimentos e provisões para uma campanha tão extensa.\n Quando os dois exércitos, já cansados e cheios de feridos, cambaleavam pelas areias manchadas de sangue e cegos pela fumaça da batalha, os agentes do Califa retornaram e, junto deles, uma comitiva de cavaleiros da �Ordem do Papel Rubro�, liderada pelo pai de Hagar.\n Exausto pelos dias seguidos de combate, Hagar mal podia fornecer uma explicação. Os mercenários, muitos deles Awali�quendi e Akbarins, foram dispersos e o remanescente do exército do Grão-ducado de E�rton foi levado de volta com eles para Anthonieta. Apesar de ser continuamente interrogado pelo caminho por seus pares e por seu pai, Hagar não conseguia construir nenhum argumento convincente, uma vez que outros de seus truques e joguetes já haviam sido revelados ou estavam sendo investigados enquanto ele esteve detido no deserto. Mas antes de chegar a Anthonieta, Hagar tomou uma das poucas atitudes que não se esperava dele ou para a qual os cavaleiros não estavam preparados: ele simplesmente fugiu.\n Com a comitiva separada tendo que levar o remanescente do exército de volta e apenas alguns poucos cavaleiros em seu encalço, Hagar rumou para longe dos elfos ou do deserto, tentando se esquivar das rotas por onde pudesse ser visto e se esforçando ao máximo para encobrir seu rastro como podia, enquanto fugia montado em seu corcel ferido e esgotado. Rapidamente, os perseguidores desistiram de Hagar, pasmos com a decisão desonrosa de fugir e agora certos da sua culpa em todos os eventos. Essa era a primeira vez que o código de honra da �Ordem do Papel Rubro� havia sido quebrado em séculos de sua existência.\n Sem saber que não era mais perseguido, Hagar continuou correndo até a morte de sua montaria e, depois disso, continuou por a pé, sempre rumo ao oeste, até que encontrasse o mar da tormenta.\n\n \n\n\n\n O erguer da noite\n \n Durante cinco anos, nada se ouviu falar de Hagar. Seu nome se tornou uma mágoa e mancha no nome da Ordem do Papel Rubro. Suas ações fizeram o Grão-ducado de E�rton cair sob suspeita e se tornasse alvo de inflamadas reclamações ou juras de vingança. Os Jahal-zim se exilaram em seu deserto, nunca mais desejando tocar no assunto, e os elfos de Allihanna passaram a olhar o reino com suspeita e dúvida, incapazes de saber até que ponto se tratava de um plano isolado ou uma corrente política dentro de um governo apenas aparentemente forte. Mas antes que as feridas pudessem ser fechadas, os pés de Hagar tocaram E�rton mais uma vez. E ele não estava sozinho.\n Durante seu exílio, Hagar cruzou o mar da Tormenta e encontrou um continente não muito grande que ainda era desconhecido dos navegantes de E�rton. Essa terra, na maior parte gelada, era habitada por um número ainda maior de criaturas, muitas delas jamais vistas antes. Ele teve que lutar a duras penas contra o gelo, feras e seres estranhos e sanguinários para sobreviver em um local assim, mas seus conhecimentos prévios sobre os Goblins lhe tiveram alguma serventia ao lidar com criaturas vis, tais como as hordas de orcs que encontrou nesse novo continente.\n Parece que o exílio mudou ainda mais Hagar, e o homem que retornou a E�rton em nada mais lembrava o cavaleiro que havia sido sagrado na catedral de Anthonieta. Com ele, havia uma imensa frota naval de navios mal acabados, reforçados com vários tipos de toras e partes de outras embarcações e, em sua maior parte, movida por remos. Nesses navios, um exército de mais de dez mil criaturas arregimentadas por Hagar, formando um exército faminto por sangue e por conquista.\n A primeira providência de Hagar foi manter seu exército e preparar a chegada de reforços para futuras batalhas. Pra tanto, ele ordenou que as árvores ao redor fossem derrubadas e largas pedras fossem movidas, na intenção de levantar seu porto e os armazéns de materiais e suprimentos e, posteriormente, uma pequena fortificação que os ajudaria a defender esse cais e alojar uma parte dos combatentes, servindo de quartel general para suas operações. Quando o material de construção acabou, os navios foram usados, desmembrando quase dois terços da frota para concluir essa empreitada, despachando de volta os navios restantes para trazer mais soldados, armas e garantir que outros navios ainda fossem construídos. Nesse ínterim, a caça ao redor foi sendo esgotada pela demanda das imensas forças de Hagar e todo e qualquer povo que vivesse ou vagasse por essa área foi capturado e tornado escravo. Para finalizar a imensa obra, que uma vez concluída, foi batizada por Hagar como Nova Magenlokk, em referência as terras de onde havia vindo o seu imenso exército e em honra ao Deus, de mesmo nome, cultuado por essas criaturas.\n A máquina de guerra estava pronta e foi posta em marcha. Enquanto o imenso exército de Hagar, cheio de Orcs, Ogros, Hobgoblins, Bugbears e Trolls marchava rumo à brilhante capital de Anthonieta, os remanescentes da frota já se preparavam para levar mais reforços a E�rton, e os emissários dessa aliança negra se deslocavam velozmente para as cidades aliadas ou outros povos de E�rton, como os Anões de Goignar e os Jahal-zim, na esperança de convencê-los de que sua raiva era focada apenas contra o Grão-Duque Lorde Gilbert Felix Antony, e não contra eles, e que quando tudo acabasse, ele apenas manteria a cidade de Anthonieta, deixando os outros Duques em paz para re-acertarem a sucessão de Lorde Gilbert e arrumarem o reino sem Anthonieta.\n Ninguém era capaz de aferir a eficiência do exército de Hagar, mas os números e a aparência de suas tropas já falavam por si só. Assim, as opiniões ficaram divididas: Os Anões, em Goignar, prometeram o não envolvimento e ainda ofereceram um acordo de venda prioritária de seus metais e armas, crendo que Hagar precisaria disso e que poderia ainda oferecer um tratado semelhante ao Grão-duque, caso Anthonieta sobrevivesse ao ataque. \nJá em Allihanna, os elfos olharam com suspeita e terror as intenções de Hagar Del Wynter. Eles dispensaram os emissários, alegando precisar de mais tempo para decidir, mas enviaram vários agentes atrás dos mesmos para descobrir onde Hagar estava e o quê planejava de fato, enquanto seus ágeis arautos correram para Anthonieta, na intenção de avisar ao Grão-duque sobre o perigo iminente.\n Em Valkaria, os nobres do Duque Herman Valkar VI silenciaram de medo. Tudo o que eles se dispuseram a fazer foi tentar fortificar sua cidade o máximo possível, preparando suas forças para o que podia ser um evento proveitoso para eles ou uma guerra total sem nenhum precedente. A cidade foi lacrada e o Duque escolheu a angústia do silêncio e da espera ao invés de reunir suas forças para defender seu senhor.\n Em cinco dias, Hagar e seu imenso exército chegaram a Anthonieta. Graças aos elfos de Allihanna, o Grão-duque e seus cavaleiros tinham o exército a postos e pronto para defender a cidade. Antes mesmo que Hagar tomasse posições, uma chuva de flechas caiu sobro os revoltosos, fazendo com que todas as suas formações se desintegrassem. Logo no início, a batalha para Hagar e seus monstros foi uma luta desesperada, que já não podia mais ser vencida quando seu exército foi flanqueado por uma arquearia de Allihanna que foi ajudar o Grão-duque a rechaçar a ameaça. Não conseguindo mais do que chegar próximo às fortificações e arranhá-las, o cavaleiro negro teve que retroceder com suas tropas. Anthonieta estava salva, por hora.\n Ao contrário do que pensavam seus opositores, Hagar não estava retornando com seu exército. A maior parte deste realmente voltou para Nova Magenlokk para reagrupar e conseguir reforços, mas uma pequena parte marchou com seu mestre em torno do Monte do Dragão e depois rumou para o norte, chegando a Valkaria com sua pequena força tarefa.\n Ao chegar à cidade, Hagar encontrou exatamente o cenário que imaginava: as notícias sobre a derrota de seu exército para a força conjunta de Anthonieta e Allihanna haviam chegado antes dele, e todo o povo respirava aliviado. Os nobres acreditavam que o perigo havia sido afastado de vez e que o Grão-duque resolveria tudo por si só. O estado de emergência havia sido abandonado e, enquanto seus governantes ainda pensavam qual postura deveriam tomar diante dos eventos, os guardas relaxavam de sua longa vigília e alerta. Um engano fatal.\n Durante mais de um dia, Hagar e seus servos observaram, planejaram, entraram aos poucos na cidade, disfarçados, abandonando armas pesadas para trás ou agindo como negociantes, vendendo alguns de seus pertences mais pesados. Na primeira noite oportuna, o próprio cavaleiro negro agiu convencendo guardas, subornando nobres e assassinando vassalos, penetrando nas defesas do castelo de Valkaria. Quando a hora crítica surgiu, seus homens criaram um grande tumulto na noite, atraindo a atenção dos guardas para o muro da cidade, enquanto seu senhor saía do castelo com bebê sobre seu manto. O príncipe herdeiro de Valkaria, o infante príncipe Velkor II fora seqüestrado.\n De posse de seu maior trunfo, o fiasco do ataque inicial acabou se tornando uma poderosa ferramenta para Hagar. O remanescente de sua força pôde ficar escondido em Nova Magenlokk, cuja localização ainda era desconhecida para o Grão-duque, esperando por reforços. Com as tropas leais ao Lorde Anthony varrendo o sul, buscando onde Hagar poderia estar escondido. Uma frota por mar foi capaz de migrar para Valkaria e lá, extorquindo o Duque Herman Valkar VI por uma base segura e um exército sobressalente. Estando mais próximos de Goignar, a fiscalização sobre a produção de armas pôde ser ainda mais próxima e perigosa, e nesse momento os Anões começaram a nutrir arrependimento por seus negócios com Hagar. Foi só uma questão de tempo para que Hagar repetisse o mesmo golpe que havia sido desferido contra ele, trazendo suas forças do sul, agora reforçadas e usando um exército sob a bandeira de Valkaria, ele pôde surpreender o Grão-Duque. Em uma noite as tropas do Grão-ducado estavam vencidas. Os últimos remanescentes da família real estavam fugindo para o exílio e a cidade entregue, passando os dias que se seguiram sendo pilhada e saqueada. Então, oficialmente, o Ducado de Lorde Gilbert Felix Anthony estava acabado, junto com sua vida.\n O quê se seguiu depois foi um tempo de terror. Com a posse do príncipe herdeiro de Valkaria, Hagar teve livre trânsito e pôde usar os recursos da cidade, constantemente ameaçando matar seu refém. De lá, ele infligia mais e mais pressão sobre os Anões e Gnomos de Goignar, mas secretamente o Duque Goignar, senhor dos anões, treinava em segredo os seus �Defensores Anões�, uma tropa de elite que seria usada no momento em que as ameaças se tornassem uma invasão real.\n Sem mais opositores verdadeiros, o exército negro marchou até atingir a Floresta de Esmeralda, manchando de vez o paraíso de Allihanna. Os elfos que não fugiram para os bosques e além, muitos buscando refúgio entre os Awali�quendi ou retornando para Sylvanus, acabaram lacaios do ditador. Por fim, até os distantes Jahal-zim estavam lutando por sua liberdade nas areias do Arbi, cedendo mês após mês diante das terríveis hordas.\n Uma vez estabelecido o poder de Hagar, ele pôde sentar e desfrutar de seu poder. Durante muito tempo, ninguém era capaz de consistentemente combatê-lo e apenas alguns pequenos grupos, como os feiticeiros do Círculo da Fênix ou os batedores de Allihanna lhe causavam algum inconveniente, para o qual ele trouxe de Magenlokk uma consistente força de Drows - inimigos das criaturas que formavam seu exército na terra mãe. Apesar de constantes rebeliões e tentativas de lutar, Hagar governou por 33 anos.\n Acostumado a um regime impiedoso, levado a mão de ferro, a nova ordem de Hagar, no entanto, não resistiu ao seu fim. Os verdadeiros acontecimentos são obscuros e muitos rumores envolvem a morte ou desaparecimento do governante de E�rton, uma vez que seu corpo nunca foi de fato encontrado. Alguns dizem que Hagar foi morto por um demônio, que de tempos em tempos é avistado em locais diferentes do continente e é chamado comumente de �Flagelo de E�rton�. Outros dizem que em sua busca por poder, ele se tornou essa criatura. Uma das versões atribui esse assassino a uma obra desesperada dos feiticeiros que se opunham a Hagar e outros mais dizem se tratar de um plano dos Drows para tomar o reino de seu mestre.\n Seja como for, depois de pouco mais de um ano do fim de Hagar, E�rton permanece em guerra. Vários de seus generais e agentes racharam seus exércitos. Outros, simplesmente desertaram, formando bandos de ladrões ou pequenas comunidades. A própria frota foi secionada e muitos capitães se tornaram piratas. Os anões usaram seus defensores para expulsar as forças negras de sua ilha, e os elfos, usaram sua astúcia. O Círculo da Fênix se empenhou em fazer o mesmo pelo bem de Valkaria, mas depois que a ordem expulsou os invasores, vários dos nobres iniciaram suas disputas para saber quem governaria na ausência do príncipe herdeiro.\n À parte disso tudo, cada uma das cidades planeja ainda como substituir o Grão-duque, uma vez que o inimigo deixou um vácuo no poder. Inicia-se uma nova era de disputa por E�rton.\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1128":{"Title":"Realms Of Disastra","Author":"Tenthousand","Submitted":20071128,"Updated":20071214,"Category":"Epic","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Number Players":"24","Setting":"Ruined world with pockets of civility.","Length":"Levels 1 - 60, Legendary Levels.

A land of evil, built on the backs and blood of slaves. A land of treachery where one must be wary not only of enemies, but also those considered allies. A land of opportunity for the cunning, bold, or ruthless. A land of death and despair for most others.\n\nWelcome to Thay. May you survive the experience.\n=========================================\n\nThay - Realm of the Red Wizards, is a Persistent World set in the Forgotten Realms. The setting began the year 1357 DR in the City of Bezantur during the Salamander Wars; a year before the Time of Troubles, and two years before the arrival of the Tuigan Horde and the crusade to stop it - all events that greatly affect the realm of Thay. \n\nThis PW allows players to join and even become leaders of the military, magical, and political forces of one of the most evil lands of Faerun: Thay.\n\nEverything for this persistent world is managed in-game by simply logging in to the server. All you need to begin is HoTU and SoU with the latest patch and you can login to the Forgotten Realms - Thay server found under the Roleplay section of Gamespy. NO external hakpaks are required to play.\n\nOne of the primary design goals of the Thay PW is to provide new experiences and many options to players every time they decide to adventure in the land of the Red Wizards. To this end, systems have been created that dynamically generate creatures, items, treasure, encounters, traps, quests, and even areas. This provides a world and situations that are always different in some way and presents ever-changing challenges for both new and returning players.\n\nThe following list contains many of the other features of the Thay PW:\n- Area Exploration XP\n- Assassination\n- Caravan Travel\n- Character Deletion Available In-Game for Players (via SIMTools)\n- Combat Dummies and Archery Targets\n- Cursed Items\n- Custom Death & Dying System\n- Custom Spawn System\n- Custom XP System for Kills, Kills caused by Traps, Trap Disarming, and Lock Picking\n- DMFI Tools for DMs\n- Drugs and Alcohol\n- Dynamic Magic Items\n- Dynamically Generated Areas/Overland Travel\n- Dynamically Generated Encounters\n- Dynamically Generated Items\n- Dynamically Generated NPCs\n- Dynamically Generated Treasure\n- Enhanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Ambient Life for NPCs\n- Extra Abilities by Class (Detect Evil, Scrying, Thievery, Tracking, Praying, Communing with Nature)\n- Flying Items\n- Hunger, Thirst, and Fatigue (HTF) System\n- Jousting\n- Languages (via the SIMTools System)\n- Limited Healing for Familiars and Animal Companions through Feeding\n- Lycanthropy\n- In-Game Character Modification (Appearance, Portraits, Body Size, Heads, Tattoos, Tattoo Color, Skin Color, Hair Color, Wings, Tails, and Eyes)\n- In-Game Modification of Clothing, Cloak, Weapon, Shield, and Helm Appearance and Colors\n- Item Enchantment System\n- Items with Special Abilities such as Hoods of Disguise and Cloaks of Invisibility\n- Message Boards\n- Mounts (Horses, Nightmares)\n- Moveable Chairs and Stools\n- Movement Skills\n- Notoriety System (Reputation System) that Affects Available In-game Options\n- NPC Healers (Some with the Ability to Raise Dead PCs)\n- Object and Item Renaming Capability\n- Party Loot Notification\n- Persistent Inn and Tavern Room Rental\n- Persistent Storage\n- Persistent Time\n- Player Awarded XP\n- Player Housing\n- Player Joinable Factions (Tharchs of Thay, Red Wizards, Guilds and Temples)\n- Player Owned Persistent Merchants\n- Player Statistics\n- Player vs. Player Combat XP\n- Player Menu Conversation to Access MANY Features of the Thay PW\n- Prestige Class Restrictions\n- Realistic Torches\n- Realistic Resting and Camping System\n- Realistic Weather\n- Riddles (Over 200+)\n- Ship Travel\n- Siege Machines\n- Slavery (Pack, Pleasure, Estate, and PC Slaves)\n- Spell Modifications\n- Stones of Recall\n- Subdual Damage against both PCs and NPCs\n- TileMagic System\n- Timed XP Awards\n- Underwater Areas\n- Unlimited Number of a Variety of Quests\n- Vampirism\n- Voice Commands and Emotes for PCs and DMs (via the SIMTools System)\n- Wild and Dead Magic Areas\n- Writable Parchment and Books\n\nScreenshot Credits\nKTA - \"Feeding the sword Godsbane a would-be Assassin\", \"Life ends here - where the living, dead, and undead collide\", and \"A Red Wizard's Betrayal\"\nTheSupremeForce - \"Definitely not the coolest place in Thay - the Hall of Flame Flowers in the Flaming Brazier temple of Kossuth\"","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1136":{"Title":"Arcana","Author":"Danielf30","Submitted":20080110,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"NWN-1.69","Website":"url]http://arcanapw.googlepages.com[/url","Number Players":"30","Setting":"Fantasy.

(Even if a project to convert the GMD engine in English is in our mind).\nSo if you are English speaking people, studying the French language, and if you want to improve your French level, you can join us, and most of the DM will welcome and help you in your mother tongue. Actually it should be a great RP gain to Aldacran to have players like you.\n\nBye\n*****\n\n********************************************************************************\n****\nDOWNLOAD and FEEDBACK in the NWNCP Main Page here: >>>>>>>>>> Link<<<<<<<<<<\n********************************************************************************\n****","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1141":{"Title":"Lands of Aradus","Author":"Lovanna","Submitted":20080127,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Twisted / Dark","Patch Version":"Works on all versions","Website":"url]http://www.z11.invisionfree.com/lands_of_lust[/url","Number Players":"40","Setting":"Many different settings.

We are a Level 60 module with D20 3.0/3.5 DnD hybrid rule-set. We are the longest running, most advance no hak content, and most fierce PvP Action module in NwN history with its original ownership and developer, Scott Milliorn. Many have failed to mimic, steal, and destroy ACN along with taking credit for much of its original content, but they have come and gone, and ACN still lives on as the original, an innovator of NwN Action PvP. Don't be fooled by imitators, this is the original and only \"A Carpathian Nightmare\" Neverwinter Nights Module.\n\nA list of features that has made this module the highest Action PvP Hall of Fame Server, including, but not limited are...\n\n80+ Subraces (more than any module in NwN)\nHigher Ground Legendary Levels(60)\nMost advanced GP,XP, Item Bank\nCharacter Editor\nUnique Market system\nParty Loot Splitter an Destroyer Tool\nOmega Forge Crafting by OmegaDM\nBounty System an Jail \nUnique Boss Encounters\nSpecial XP Reward for Rogues with LockPicketing Boss Treasure\nBindstones an Party Portal\nMass Dislike Wand an Emote Wand\nTotal PC Appearance Modifier\nNo Alignment Restrictions\nFull Crafting Shop \nPk Score System\nDynamic Arena(No DM Required)\nSequener Wands(Fast Buffing)\nSimtools (Higher Ground)\nMax Hit Points\nCharacter Deleter\n\nThe module was built, programmed and created by Scott and Sarah Milliorn. It is also the longest running Legendary Level PvP server besides the original, Higher Ground. ACN also has the most subraces in any PvP module. ACN has the original PvP Score/Bounty Hunter System. ACN was first launched in early 2005, but was completed in 2004. Development started in 2003 originally as a Path of Ascension module. The development of Path of Ascension ACN stems off from the days as a developer for the Ancient Warriors Clan, the original authors of Path of Ascension NwN. After a year and lack of support, it was put on hold for over a year until ACN was born. Module was then finished that year. Wolfstar was the head Dungeon Master originally. Elwoodini was the first host, serving for 4 years straight. Qwen and Karyn Asher hosted BETA v2 of ACN later on, with Elwoodini hosting v2 full time after BETA ended. Desi has relieved me (Milliorn) of forum/website work for almost 4 years now. The only Dungeon Master to serve on both v1 and v2 of ACN was Wolfstar (their has been many that has come and gone). The longest faithful member of ACN as a player and later on retired Dungeon Master, Durf, who has played ACN since its official launch, still plays to this day over five years later. Many other members rival Durf's commitment such as the Legion of The Damned Guild, who has played ACN for nearly 5 years now, along with Order of Vengeance, led by The Queen of Vengeance.

This in turn, provides a wide range of challenges that no single character can face alone. If you enjoy mindless hack 'n slash, Mythos is NOT the server for you!\n\n Several years in the making, Mythos boasts all custom created maps (130+) and quests (55+) that are unique to the server. There is also a wide selection of custom equipment (900+).\n\nSome popular features to the server include: \n- NEW: OnPlayerChat commands to make your familiar, animal companion and summoned creature speak\n- Bonus XP for hunting in groups \n- Low magic item properties (+3 is the most sold in stores, up to +5 for quest rewards or boss monster drops) \n- Bonus XP for some (not all) successful skill and spell use\n- Class and level based shopping\n- Persistent player location, hit points, spell use, etc. saved across relogs\n- Player crafting of hak based armors, shields and weapons\n- Silent save of player files every couple of minutes\n- Custom quest system with persistent journals\n- Optional auto loot and loot notification systems\n- Available player housing\n- Available player run guilds\n- Trash cans with rewards for using them \n- Clean up script (non-heartbeat) \n- Numerous convenience widgets like auto follow, afk, emotes, and save player file \n- Persistent bank accounts \n- Spell share with familiars \n- Drop and carry furniture \n- Traveling shop, stock up any where, any time \n- Newbie donation chest that can receive items from anywhere in game \n- Selection of food and drink (for fun not a rest requirement) \n- Player added content is encouraged \n- Dedicated linux server machine \n\n Custom hak packs are required (196 Mb). Link to the haks is provided below.\n\n As Mythos pre-dates the CEP, that hak system is not needed to play on the server. If you already have the CEP installed, you do not need to change that installation. Our haks are completely separate. Having both systems installed on your computer, provided you have the storage space, will not interfere with each other.\n\n The haks contain both content from the vault and those that we have created. We realize the haks are a large download, but it is hard to do mythology on the models provided with the game. What would Greece be without cyclops, centaurs, columned buildings, and the Pegasus?\n\n The base torso and pelvis models have been replaced with full nudity models. There is adult content included on the server. HOWEVER Mythos is not a socials server. If all you want is cyber, Mythos is NOT the server for you! Due to this adult content, there are no minors allowed on the server.\n\n The server is listed in the Role Play section.\n Server Name: Realms of Mythology \n Module Name: realms_of_mythology-XXX \n Direct Connect: 71.39.93.235:5121 \n The XXX in the module name denotes the version number for the module file. This is an easy way to tell if the server has been upgraded. \n\nWebsite: Link\n\nForum: Website: Link\n\nUpdates:\n3-28-07 Minor Formatting\n7-31-09 Minor updates and screenies\n9-3-10 Updated server features","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1157":{"Title":"Leyendas Perdidas","Author":"DM Emaysh, DM Triskelion, DM Atreyu","Submitted":20080404,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.68","Website":"url]http://leyendasperdidas.nwnhispano.net/[/url","Number Players":"1-32","Setting":"Thelios (nuestro propio mundo creado de cero!)","Number DMs":"3","IPs":"leyendasperdidas.servegame.com:5121","Scope":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"Any","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Schedule":"24 h","Treasure":"Moderate","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Experience Rewards":"Moderate to High","Content Guide":"Everyone","RolePlay":"Heavy","Forums":"Link","Description":"Saludos neverwinteros:\n\nEscribo este post en nombre del equipo de DMs de Leyendas Perdidas, un\nservidor de rol de Neverwinter Nights 1. Hemos creado el módulo y el mundo\nque representa desde cero, con influencias de muchos sitios como es lógico.\nDespués de mucho trabajo y muchos reveses, hemos conseguido un módulo\ncompleto, con muchos atractivos, y queremos darlo a conocer.\n\nEstas son las características más importantes de Leyendas Perdidas:\n\n-Servidor dedicado.\n\n-Sistema de permanencia: Usando un objeto antes de salir del server, te\nasegurarás de que al volver a entrar tu pj estará en el mismo sitio donde\nlo dejaste, aunque haya caidas o reinicios.\n\n-Limpieza de áreas: Los bichos generados en los encuentros se borran cuando\nel área es abandonada por todos los pjs. Ocurre lo mismo con los objetos\ndejados en el suelo. Esta característica reducirá mucho el lag.\n\n-Subrazas: Hay numerosas subrazas disponibles para elegir: aasimar,\ntiefling, genasies, varias subrazas de elfos y enanos...\n\n-Deidades: Elige una deidad para tu pj y al morir tendras la posibilidad de\nregenerar en el templo del dios principal que te corresponda.\n\n-Idiomas: Además de Común y el propio de su raza, tu pj podrá expresarse en\nun idioma adicional (Élfico, Mediano, Enano, Orco, Dracónico, etc.) por\ncada bonificador de inteligencia. Por ejemplo, si tu pj es un elfo con\ninteligencia 14 (bono +2) hablará Común, Élfico y dos idiomas más. Además,\nlos pícaros y druidas contarán con el argot propio de su profesión. Al\nhacer uso de un idioma, los que no posean ese mismo idioma no serán capaces\nde entenderte (no leerán lo que has escrito, sino su \"traducción\" al idioma\nque sea).\n\n-Acciones directas de los pjs: Si escribes *se sienta* tu pj se sentará en\nel suelo. Hay muchas funciones como esta. Para que funcionen ha de\nactivarse utilizando la vara de emociones o bien activando un idioma\ncualquiera.\n\n-Encuentros ajustados al nivel de tu pj o de tu party: Cuanto más fuertes\nseais, mas fuerte seran los bichos, y viceversa.\n\n-Quest automáticas y salas de entrenamiento para ayudaros a conseguir los\nprimeros niveles.\n\n-Posibilidad de crear vuestro propio Clan, consultando con el equipo de\nDMs.\n\nEn cuanto a los requisitos para jugar, hace falta el CEP 2 (como el 99% de\nlos servers actuales), la versión 1.68 del juego (idem) y una serie de haks\nconocidos como Worms, que para los que no los conozcan, diré que son\nespectaculares! Son tilesets nuevos, muy bien hechos y que le dan un aire\ntotalmente nuevo al juego. Si no me creéis, echad un vistazo a estas\ncapturas:\n\nCaptura 1\nCaptura 2\nCaptura 3\n\nNo cuesta más de 20 minutos descargarlos e instalarlos con una conexión\nmedia (comprobado). Os aseguro que merece la pena: en muchos casos los\npaisajes que se logran (gracias en parte al talento de nuestra mapeadora)\nson comparables a los del nwn2.\n\nAun hay muchas cosas por hacer, y vamos a seguir trabajando. Por eso\nqueremos invitaros a que entréis a jugar a Leyendas Perdidas y compartáis\nvuestro rol con nosotros y entre vosotros, que creéis historias y tramas\nque os inspiren y os motiven y que os hagan disfrutar roleando como ninguna\notra cosa puede hacerlo. Tenemos muchas ganas de desarrollar la historia\ndel server con tramas y quests, pero para eso necesitamos que estéis ahi.\nVenid a vivir a Thelios, vuestro personaje quizá sufra o quizá disfrute...\npero vosotros os lo pasaréis en grande.\n\nEsperamos veros muy pronto.\n\nUn saludo ^^\n\nEnlaces:\n\nWeb de Leyendas Perdidas\n(gracias a nwnhispano)\nForo de Leyendas Perdidas\n(gracias a nwnhispano)\nHakpak de\nLeyendas Perdidas\nCEP 2","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1158":{"Title":"Mysteries of Warington","Author":"WaFather","Submitted":20080406,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"url]http://warington.yolasite.com/[/url","Number Players":"45","IPs":"64.71.117.163:5121","PVP":"Full PvP","Death":"Two unique death systems.

If you are having problems finding a home, come check us out. The server is listed under Roleplay and is named Dawn of Nordock. Direct connect is 76.168.113.144:5121\n\nHere is some info on us:\n\n1. It uses CEP2.1 to down load Link\nThat is the only hak you will need. (most servers require you to have that)\n\n2. Resting is done if you have a Bedroll and Rations. You do have a wait period between rest.\n\n3. Though it is based off of Nordock, it is not Nordock. It does have some of the same names as to keep the feel. Almost all of the 350+ areas in the mod that players can access are custom made.\n\n4. We have created a history to the land that the players can use to help with their RolePlay. This history will have clues to other quest that will be implemented in the mod. We are in the process of creating one epic quest that players can do and start working on it on low levels.\n\n5. We are a roleplay server, but are not strickly roleplay.. Hack and slash type players will have fun there too, which is why we installed a quest generator. This way you hack 'n slash type can get your own personal quest thats sends you all over the mod.\n\n6. Low to mid Magic. Meaning you will find +1 and +2 items and maybe even +3, But anything higher than that will have been given out from DM ran quest. +5 is the highest I will allow the server to go. Those such Items will be rare. The Higher the + the more rare it gets.\n\n7. We have an freindly and active DM team that bring the server alive for the players to enjoy. \n\n8. Player ran guilds are allowed and encouraged. But they do need to be approved by the head dm.\n\n9. We are using a custom spawn system that blows bioware's system out of the water. It has allowed us to do amazing things with mod by controlling the spawned monsters, traps, and placables.\n\n10. Custom races are only allowed after a Dm has approved it. This is to keep specail races, just that special.\n\nWe try to shape the world to the actions of the players.

His people work because of pride in what they have achieved and in what they might. They fight, confident of Right in their actions and with a love for the King who has shown them the path to glory. \n\nTo the West, Queen Xala's rule is absolute - expending the lives of her subjects for her pleasure, the furtherance of a cause, or mere whim. When one has committed such atrocities as this Queen and lived for so long, there are no thoughts of rebellion. There is only fear. Her subjects work and fight for her, terror moving their strings.\n\nIn the Middle are the Watchers. It is they who hold together this fragile status quo, allied to neither side, but prepared to scotch the limbs of those that would reach across the divide they have created. It is here that adventurers are draw, this neutral arena. But, in truth, this is the most dangerous area of all. In time every adventurer picks a side, the actions of the three powers are truly decided by which group holds sway in this middle ground. A single action here can count for a thousand swords on the field. The Watchers are often heard to say that a piece may be late to be put into play, but even a pawn can take the head of a royal�\n\nA quick word\n\nI�ll update this as regularly as I can (possibly uploaded files) to try and give a feel of the server. Haks are listed on the forum (CEP2 and JenX). The latter makes taking your clothes off a lot more, well, revealing. This is part of the reason for the mature rating below. I picked the long form to give a reasonably balanced account of things here, but there�s plenty more to be said. Check the forum or have a nose around. If you decide to do the latter, please remember we�re recruiting players. If it�s empty, come back later. Time zones have a lot to do with it, but if a DM�s on, you could find you get �special� treatment. I can be contacted through the forum (Etharim/DMGolden) or by e-mail (thegodofallthings@hotmail.co.uk). We do take comments seriously � god knows they�ve listened to enough of mine � and are always tweaking things about the server. I�ve included (hopefully) a piece from the forum called Reflections. This is basically some RP overheard by one of the NPCs. I think it gives a bit of the flavour of things, heavy DM and PC interaction. You can check the forums for more.

Y ha sido ubicada una Sastreria donde os haran vuestros atuendos a medida.\n\n3- El sistema de descanso se basa (a parte de posadas y sitios habilitados) en montar campamentos. Se necesita una antorcha equipada y algo de madera seca (se coge de los arboles).\n\n4- Por supuesto estan el cubilete de dados, las animaciones, los idiomas, etc. y la regeneracion de tesoros/criaturas.\n\n5- Sistema de regeneracion de PNJs, Tesoros, Encuentros, y Ubicados. (oficios y otros)\n\n6- Limpieza de areas. (Se borraran los objetos de criaturas, y restos de animales que no sean recogidos del area)\n\n7- Se ha añadido y traducido una herramienta de \"Daño atenuado\" para PvP.

Con la seguridad activada, cada vez que tu cuenta inicie sesion en el servidor, este compara tu CDKEY actual, con la que tenias cuando activaste la SEGURIDAD. De no coincidir el PJ aparecera PETRIFICADO. Al volver a entrar con la CDKEY que tienes registrada, sera disuelta la petrificacion.\n\n\n12- Script Anti-Grupos. Consistente en echar del grupo a los miembros de este que no esten en el mismo area del Lider. Obviamente tras un tiempo prudencial y despues de avisar al jugador.\n\n13- Sistema de subrazas semi-automatico: Requiere presencia DM para la creacion del PJ online. Subrazas incluidas: Drow, Koblod, Pixie, Aasimar, Tiflin, Liche, Vampirismo y Licantropia (Lobo, Gato y Rata).\n\n14- Otros añadidos: Arena de combate, Burdel, Juegos de Azar (Blackjack, Rueda de la Fortuna y Tragamonedas Montruos), Sistema de creacion de Objetos Unicos Online (Requiere presencia DM), Sistema de cofres Persistentes...\n\n15- Se permite el acceso con el \"respaldo\" del nwn.\n\nEn la pagina web podras ver un Video/Presentacion del servidor.\n\nNo lo dudes, si estan aburrido de siempre lo mismo unete a TierrasPrometidas, donde la imaginacion vale mas que la fuerza.

Your initial job is to descend from the great White Kingdom, and answer the prayers of those in dire need of assistance. As you continue to serve the great army of Heaven, you begin to learn that not all is what it seems. Someone behind the scenes is manipulating key figures in the kingdom of Heaven, and something sinister is about to unfold.\n\n\nWhy you might like Heaven�s Descent\n\nTHERE ARE NO NEW SYSTEMS THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN. That�s right, no hard core rule set, no advanced systems for things that should be simple � in Heaven�s Descent you can literally just create your character and go! Heaven�s Descent offers experience rewards on certain enemies (Mid Bosses, Bosses, and Rare Spawns) for those wishing to party, and unique level items can be earned in PvP competitions held by GMs!\nAs well, all custom items are default grayscale; there is a dye shop available selling cheap dyes so color yourself up! Be a unique Pink Armored Bard Cleric!\n\n\nAbout the game play\n\nAlthough the story and quest line is linear, your character will gain access to a variety of different landscapes to explore very quickly. And while we�ve ensured that the first monster you encounter doesn�t do uber amounts of damage, we�ve intended the module to keep an increasing scale of difficulty.\n\nAll areas are designed as instanced dungeons, with a Mid Boss and Final Boss at the end of each. The first dungeon will accommodate you into the world and get you comfortable, but after that you�ll have to plan your character carefully to ensure success in other missions.\n\nAlso note, enemies will always drop what they are using. There is no exception to this. This makes the best gear the hardest to get, because the chances of that gear killing you before you become the rightful owner is high.\n\n\nHosting\n\nSome people may be happy to know that Heaven's Descent is being professionally hosted in a data center, located in Toronto Canada. This will ensure 99% uptime, and a lag free experience for all!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1178":{"Title":"Dalelands Beyond","Author":"Sky","Submitted":20080628,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.68","Website":"url]http://www.dalelandsbeyond.com[/url","Number Players":"40","Forums":"Link","Description":"A persistant dalelands base world set 500 years after any current fr setting.

Many battles were waged to protect towns, and many people were killed. Those who tried to flee the continent of Tlia were captured or killed by the demons, and one by one, cities began to fall.\n\nIt is 100 years later, and Tlia has not seen a single minute of daylight.

Almost all the inhabitants of the Inn are travelers, either by design or by chance. Many have simply stopped here during journeys to other places, while others came to the Inn accidentally, then realized they could not get home. \n\nOpening a door in the Serpent takes you into a dark labyrinth-like passage. Along its walls are many doors of all types; doors made completely of links of metal, doors frosted over with ice or covered in a layer of shadow, doors glowing with ever changing glyphs, and more. Those who look about keenly may notice that some doors appear or disappear or seem to change position along the walls in an endless, silent shuffle.\n\nNobody knows who built the place, nor why it seems unfettered by the rules of normal time and space, but shift it does, and many travelers are thankful for that. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nOOC INFO:\n\nThe World Serpent Inn is requires custom haks to play or preview. WSI has over 300 highly detailed areas to explore, with more in the works. WSI features custom classes, spells, races, skills, quests, unique magic items, player housing, and an incredible community of mature role-players.\n\nThere are many different areas to explore, at varying levels of difficulty. \n\nDynamic changes are made to the module as time passes and as a result of in-game events. Players can literally change the face of the module through their actions in the game. DMs are true storytellers and work with the players to give them a chance in the spotlight.\n\nWSI has no eating/fatigue systems. Resting is easy to do and can be done anywhere outside of battle, but does require a brief wait between rests.","Rating":9.93,"Votes":57,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"1187":{"Title":"MERP","Author":"MERP Team","Submitted":20080725,"Updated":20081221,"Category":"Epic","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Number Players":"50","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Tricks & Traps":"Heavy","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Moderate","DM Needed":"DM required","Alignments":" ","Experience Rewards":"Moderate to High","PVP":"Mixed","Vault Type":"Server","Connection":"Cable","Content Guide":"Adult","RolePlay":"Heavy","Description":"MERP was run down by 1 DM and Real Life Issues.

The other 2 factions: Spartans and Persians you will see spawn inside the game maps as elite bosses that drop special helper bonuses which will assist your faction in winning the map. At this time 300 is setup like the popular module Alestorm. Its an arena map based module which rotates its maps. Allowing players to enter each map and defend their leader, while destroying the other teams troops, defenders and evetually their boss. \n 300's current goal is to achieve a respectable player base throughout the week and eventually 300 will be transformed into a game world where players will compete for land territory by taking over forts, castles and strongholds of the opposing factions. 300 uses a custom \"credit\" system to track every player's death and kills while on the battlefield. This \"credit\" system is used to give your player/guild a reputation as well as establish many other variables throughout the module. 300 will be heavily dependent on guilds. At this time you may create a guild and gets its name growing in popularity by killing 15 bosses and using your player tool to register a guild.\nPlease see your journal and the entry update sign for more information on guilds and the future plans of 300.\n Currently 300 is hosted on a duo core 2 pentium platform with 2 gigs of 633 ddr2 ram.

The fact that the enemies will attack and kill each other is a very cool tweak, especially when you are as devious (and cowardly) as the rogues I typically play. Also that the enemies progress in difficulty as you gain levels so you never really gain superiority over previously-vanquished foes is a reality check for smug players, and it took me a while (the hard way) to gain that knowledge. There are other additional little twists that add to a very satisfying gaming experience, but again, the crafting and forging capabilities are an unusual and totally challenging sidebar to the whole character build process. My kudos for your creativity and development prowess.\"\n\nAnd yet another told me:\n\n\"The thing about this module that I've come to love the most is that a couple of levels really makes a difference :) you feel how much more powerful you get. \"\n\nMounts available for Paladin, Blackguard, Purple Dragon Knight, and Ranger.

Ah, the North! A land filled with adventure and stories. A land seemingly always poised for battle and yet peaceful. A land of intrigue, politics, religion, treachery, beauty, economic prosperity, and much, much more.\n\nIn the North you will find yourself immersed in an amazing world with many others of like mind. The North has hundreds of places to visit and explore. You and the people you meet there will interact with all kinds of people and creatures. You can scale mountains, cross deserts, and travel beneath the waters. Challenges will be met and overcome. With good teamwork between you and your fellow adventurers, nothing can stand in your way! Riches, fame, or perhaps just a quiet place in the wilderness that you can call your own could be yours someday in The North.\n\nThe North has some of the greatest crafters in all of Faerun. Local artisans can make anything from a tasty apple pie up to items of great magic. Resources abound in this wonderful land. The economy supports as many crafters as wish to persue their crafts.\n\nVisit the great city of Silverymoon, the Gem of the North. It is a peaceful city of good folk. A melting pot of various races on Faerun: Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings and many others are not uncommon on the streets of this fair city. Meet up and have a drink in the Golden Oak Inn. Shop in the finest stores. Join a local guild. Spend some time crafting fine goods yourself for fun or profit. Centrally located in the North, Silverymoon is a stepping off point for many an adventure to rid the lands of evil doers.\n\nOr try your fortune in the Zhentarim controlled city of Llorkh. Llorkh is a rugged city in the southern portion of The North. Filled with its own brand of adventure, those that aspire to greatness, regardless of the consequences, would find Llorkh to be a fitting place to live. Not what many would call a vacation destination, Llorkh has been known to favor commerce. It is a located on a major trading route, and boasts many an exotic fare. Visit the Worried Wyvern and try your hand at a game of chance. Stop by the Old Cemetery and learn some of the history of those that could not make it in Llorkh. But watch your step here, as there are many that would put you behind them in their quest for power and glory.\n\nThen if you are really up for a challenge, there is the Underdark. The great Drow city of Menzoberranzan lies deep under the surface of Faerun. Ah, the Drow, where your closest friend may be your biggest enemy. Where sisters slay sisters and males know their place.

In the last days of it's known existence it ripped itself apart. The land itself in an attempt to rid itself of it's taint destroyed itself. In a cataclysmic event it vanished from it's existence there. A curtain in the deep ethereal was torn and the land collapsed into the rift.\n\nThe Dark Isles exists now in its own demiplane which means it is simply separate from any cosmology. A self contained pocket dimension that hangs suspended in the deep ethereal plane. \nIn Manual of the Planes terms, The Dark Isles is a demiplane on the Deep Ethereal (as presented as an option on pg. 55 of MotP). The Deep Ethereal is a transitive plane connecting the Ethereal Planes of the multiverse. Essentially it is tucked away in a dark and unremarkable corner of the universe where no one can see it.\n In the ending days before the land collapsed many sought to flee from the chaos. Many left even as many were abandoned to the fate of the land. Those who escaped though did so unaware that their souls were still bound to the land. It was not long before the ethereal rift claimed the land and surrounding islands.\n For many years all who were of the land slept dead and dreaming unaware that they did so, unaware that the land was destroyed and reformed. \n\n\n Haks are below you also need cep 2.3.\n Link to CEP_23_Full_C.7z below \n Check out our forum for more info. \n\nHaks are now also available for download from or new website! \nLink","Rating":9.75,"Votes":6,"Awards":[]},"1228":{"Title":"Dawn Over Rhodeva","Author":"Kirin (ryakage)","Submitted":20090119,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"NWN-1.69","Website":"url]http://www.createforum.com/rhodevadawn/index.php?mforum=rhodevadawn[/url","Number Players":"40+","Setting":"An original dark fantasy world called Rhodeva.","Length":"Persistant World","Number DMs":"Varies.","Scope":"Epic","Level Range":"1-16","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Schedule":"Persistant.","Number Servers":"One dedicated","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"All","PVP":"Mixed","Vault Type":"Server","Connection":"T1+","Content Guide":"Mature","RolePlay":"Heavy","Description":"You will find yourself in the rocky, forested country of Duranin, whose lands run the northeastern coast of Rhodeva.

Your every action can shift the outcome of events. \n - Rich, original dark fantasy world, with never-before-seen wonders to discover. \n - A break with tired clichés: You'll never fight rats in someone's basement. \n - Immersive dungeons; no two areas shall ever feel alike. \n - Elaborate \"boss\" mechanics, requiring strategy and cooperation to defeat. \n - Many classes redesigned to return to traditional class roles; no class shall be useless. \n - Extraordinary attention to detail in every aspect of design. \n - Collection of the very best content released over the years; only the best models and tilesets. \n\n(DoR is currently under development, scheduled for a live launch in the coming months; join our team, and help make DoR the premire dark fantasy PW around!

Not a permadeath server.\nThere is numerous ways to respawn from the Fugue. \nTo your body or to your temple. ","Connection":"T1+","House rules":"Player Expectations\n\nThere is a certain behavior that the community of TSM expects from all it's players. The following guide is to help understand what sort of attitude and feel we want the community to project. None of these are hard and fast rules, but do not be surprised if you are reprimanded for not following this guide (and thus not following the community spirit). Much of this guide is written with the thoughts of respect, fair play, and maturity in mind while still allowing for the fun that is to be had.\n\nExpectation 1 - Be Excellent To One Another\n\nOur OOC attitudes towards one another can go a long way to forming a very strong community. This can be carried out in various manners.\n\n- Be friendly and respectful to people who are new to the server or to the game. Be friendly in your responses. If they ask a question, be kind in your response. Teach. Help the new player learn the ropes you yourself had to learn.\n\n- Be respectful to your fellow players OOCly. Some characters may not get along ICly, but that does not mean you as a player can not get along OOCly with the other player. Do not mix IC feelings with OOC ones and vice verse. Do not mistake someone's negative IC actions to mean they do not like you OOCly.\n\n- Always keep a calm head. If something has happened in game to anger you step away from the game, take a breath, then come back and communicate in a calm and rational manner. Cooler heads will always prevail and will make things for everyone involved go far smoother.\n\n- Communicate when you feel something is wrong. Communication is key and a DM crews eyes can not be everywhere at all times. Nor can it know if someone in the community is remiss in their actions if nothing is said. Do not report things in anger, gather all your facts (logs, screen shots, etc), so that all parties are sure that it just isn't a misunderstanding.\n\n- Be respectful to crew members. Do not be rude, flippant, or ignore someone when you are told you are breaking a rule or are reprimanded for not following this guide. That is a show of disrespect for everyone on the server -- not just the DMs -- and will not be tolerated. If this is the attitude you automatically carry, then it's best you go somewhere else as the TSM community would not want someone like you around.\n\nHere is a thread by Stonewyvern on more ways to interact with your fellow players:\n\nLink\n\nExpectation 2 - Roleplay 24/7\n\nThis is a full Roleplay server. One should roleplay at all times be they in a bar, in a city, in a dungeon, in the wilds, even while dead. We want players to be completely immersed in their character and in the world around them. Even when the PC is all alone, roleplay. You will never know which DM will be watching and a simple emote or utterance can give a DM all sorts of wonderful ideas to work with (and a potential RP XP drop). This can also help with giving yourself a sense of your own character and his or her own growth.\n\nBeing immersed also means to be as realistic as possible. Your character would not run everywhere they went. They'd certainly run from danger or perhaps run into danger in emergencies. However, running everywhere would be unrealistic. Especially through towns, inns, and the like. You don't run through a grocery store at full tilt, nor do you run to your mailbox or to the bank at the same clip. Even if they're traveling a far distance on the road, most of that will be walked, otherwise your character would be fully winded by the time they actually got into a fight.\n\nYour character's health level also should be paid attention to in regards to roleplay. If your walking around at \"Near Death\", they wouldn't be walking around as if nothing was wrong. Roleplay it out. Have them stagger, limp, or hold a hand on their wound. There are numerous ways to roleplay injuries out and all are acceptable, but do not ignore the fact that your character is injured.\n\nKeep OOC talk in the main chat to a minimum. AFKs or BRBs are to be expected, as Real Life always takes president, but do not make OOC talk a heavy habit. If you must speak OOC keep it in tells. The party chat is also considered IC, so do not use that for OOC talk either. Party chat can be seen by all DMs, so to keep chat spam to a minimum for the DMs, please only use party chat as a way to \"shout\" at one another through the next area transitions (such as a PC heading into a cave to check it out then hollering at his waiting companions that's it's all clear and to come in).\n\nExpectation 3 - WoW We Are Not\n\nThe focus of TSM is to be able to roleplay and immerse oneself while playing your PC. It is not the focus to get your character up in levels as fast as possible. Nor is it the focus for your character to get as much loot and gold as possible. To that end, the crew expects it's players to play the game with the following expectations.\n\n- Be sensible when deciding to head to a combat area you've been to before. Always try to give your characters strong Roleplay reasons as to why they will enter that area. Try not to go to the same place too many times in the same week, as it makes less and less roleplay sense for a PC to visit it. If the crew sees you are visiting the same dungeon over and over it could end up being seen as \"farming\" and is heavily frowned upon by the crew. You may be asked to move along and will be kept on report for others on the crew to keep an eye on.\n\nDefinition: One \"visit\" means you enter the area, deal with the spawns in that area once then leave the area. It does not mean you can enter the area and go around in continuous circles to catch respawns. This will, again, be seen as spawn camping. Don't do it.\n\nHere's a post by Stonewyvern regarding both farming and roleplay expectations:\n\nLink\n\n- Report exploits. If you feel a mechanic or situation makes it far to easy for a person to gain XP or gold with little to no risk to the PC, report it to a DM immediately. The excuse of \"it was in the system so I thought it was okay\" is not an excuse and could be grounds for an immediate banning if you are caught using it. If you are unsure of a situation, ask. Who knows, you may just get rewarded for being truthful and wanting things to be fair.\n\n- Be patient. There is no \"race\" to be top dog here. We all love character progression, but there is no need to get impatient when you are unable to level. Badgering DMs or bending rules in order to get what you want as fast as possible only serves to irritate others and isolate yourself. In a multi-player environ where we're all here to have fun, this is not a good thing. Again, be patient.\n\n- Take your lumps. If you or your whole party dies, take the XP/gold penalty and do not complain. Do not try to cheat the system by logging on as another character to resurrect your party. Do not send tells to someone asking for a \"rescue\" when there is no logical IC reason why that PC should even know you died. Not only is that metagaming, it's trying to cheat the system. Play the game as it's been intended. Take the hit and respawn. That's part of the \"risk\" part in the \"risk and rewards\" of adventuring.\n\nExpectation 4 - Participate and Communicate\n\nRegardless of what style of play you have, even if your PC happens to be an anti-social loner, try and participate in what TSM has to offer. Talk to people in tells, put posts on the forums, make your presence known. Even if you feel you don't have much to contribute, an occasional \"hello\" or \"thank you\" can be appreciated. Don't cut yourself off from other players just because they don't happen to be in your \"circle\". Keep open, keep friendly, keep involved.\n\nCommunication is part of this and we hope all participants do just that. Be it something positive or an issue that needs to be resolved, communicate. Silence changes nothing.\n\nExpectation 5 - Play Fair\n\nAs much as we all want our PCs to \"win\" in everything they do, it's still no excuse to allow yourself unfair advantages. These unfair advantages can range in many varied ways and is usually collectively known as Metagaming. It is akin to cheating and the TSM crew heavily frowns upon this coming from any member of the community. Be they player, builder, forum moderators, DM, QM, and even the Admin, no one has the right to metagame.\n\nThe following are examples of metagaming. Mind that these examples are not the limit of what can be considered metagaming and is not intended to be used as a definitive list as being the only ways to metagame.\n\n- Reading the floating name above a disguised PC and, even though the PC has not emoted or said anything that should make your character suspicious, you begin to try and have your PC \"guess\" who the disguised PC is. Or you have your PC automatically guess who a person is based on very flimsy information.\n\n- Reading from a story about a PC on the forums that is not intended to be In Character information and give your PC a reason to 'guess' things about that PC based on what you read.\n\n- Having your PC question another about something your PC shouldn't know about (but you do OOCly as a player), then having your PC say when asked how they knew, \"I was just guessing.\" This is also known as the 'bait' technique. Example:\n\nPC 1: So have you thought of leaving more anonymous notes for that Banite to find?\nPC 2: Not yet. I don't have enough information to goad him with--.. wait, how did you know it was me?\nPC2: I didn't. I was just guessing.\n\nThis is a very unfair way of making OOC information, IC information for your character. \"Guessing\" is a very flimsy excuse, especially when your PC has no reason to even guess.\n\n- Having your PC know more Lore then they should. Just because you have read it in a sourcebook does not give you rights to have your character know about it. This is doubly so if your PC has little or no Lore rating. Remember, even the greatest Loremasters in Faerun will not know everything.\n\n- Going back and forth over the same transition point in order to try and \"lose\" hostiles. This is using a game mechanic in order to win, which qualifies as metagaming.\n\n- Having two PCs that you play freely share information with one another, giving yourself the excuse that your characters \"talked\" things over. This is passing on information OOCly no matter how much you RP it as they are both your characters. This is very detrimental if your PCs are on \"opposite sides\".\n\n- Altering your playstyle based on what you know OOCly through either the forums or game mechanics. An example would be that you read on the forums a story that indicates that charming bard is actually a follower of Mask and you immediately have your PC act wary of him when he's done nothing in game to make your PC wary. Another is seeing a DM spawned NPC showing up as hostile for you (highlighting red) and you immediately take the defensive even though that NPC has not made any hostile motions towards you or indicated that they will attack.","Content Guide":"Teen","Player Requirements":"To have a ton of fun and role play as best as they can.","RolePlay":"Heavy","Forums":"Link","Description":"Link\n\nWell met \n\nTales of the Silver Marches has slowly become TSM or even just The Silver Marces is a hard core role playing world.\n\nIt was started in 2003 by a man named darkeagle and has changed hands a few times until 2006 when Stonewyvern took over. \n\nIt has been under his GMship until 2009 when he asked two known builders/scripters to do as we liked with it and viola...TSM is reborn.\n\nWe are based in the Forgotten Realms Silver Marches Area and have seem to become quite hit.\n\nWe average in numbers of players of anywhere from 5 to 12 on off peak hours and 10 to 16 on normal hours peak hours�though to be honest sometimes we have huge numbers on random nights in the 20s and even 30s. \n\nIf you are interested in playing or what not here please check out our forums and come in.\n\nAxes high and beards wet till we meet again\n\n\n","Rating":9.82,"Votes":28,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"1235":{"Title":"Islands of Architeuthis","Author":"Local_","Submitted":20090208,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://www.greatislands.net/[/url","Number Players":"30","Setting":"Multiple Island setting.

Players pit themselves against the biggest and the baddest in an arena setting. \nGladiator is an unabashed PVM power gaming server, in which your toon will surely rise to obscene levels of power.\n\nBelow is a list of our custom systems.\n\nArenaround System:\nThe Arenaround system is a brand new encounter system developed specifically Gladiator.\n\nGladiatorial Training:\nBased on the Guardian System from the PW Altharia, the training system enhances combat by adding new events. Spell casters enjoy boosts to their spells, melee toons enjoy added damage during combat, including a chance of area of effect damage. Currently we have 10 trainers, each introducing new and unique combat events. Archers are represented in this system and get very powerful on this server.\n\nHigher Ground Legendary Level System: As seen on the PW Higher Ground, this system allows for Leveling past 40, taking your toon to level 60. \n\nAcademics: Toons are allowed to choose one Course of Study. Each course is designed to enhance either one of the many Gladiatorial Paths, or other systems in play. \n\nGuild System:\nThere is a custom, non player driven, guild system in Gladiator. Each Guild offers unique effects when using Guild Armor.\n\nGuild Armor/Rings: Upgradeable items granted by the Guild House of Garriston. This is a no loss, point based system, which is based on level rather than the number of Arena Bouts you win.\n\nItem Upgrades:\nEvery type of wearable item is upgradeable via a point based system. Points are gathered by finishing Arena Bouts, slaying the boss and collecting your Gladiatorial Achievement Credits.\n\nWeapon Upgrades: Every type of weapon is represented in our weapon upgrading system. This system is based on GAC's, Level and Gold.\n\nCustom Summons System:\nWe have altered the creatures that are called via the various summons spells. Summons are viable in this mod.\n\nNades:\nThe newly developed Nade system uses the Grenade items already present in NWN. These Nades are enhanced by the Gladiatorial Trainer: Forward Scout and the Academic Course: Grenadier.\n\nArena Traps:\nA very robust trap system, allowing players with the Skill: Set Trap access to very powerful and useful traps. This system is further enhanced by the Academic Course: Master Trapper.\n\nThere are many more systems for players to discover.\n\nCurrently there are over 30 arenas for players to fight in, not including the 666 layers of the abyssal arena system within the Eternal Arena complex.\nCome test your strength in the External Arena Circuit, and gain access to the Eternal Arena. Boost your toon to new levels of power, facing stronger opponents at every turn.\n\nI have received some great feeback about this mod and have decided to take some time to enrich the story and create a deeper sense of immersion. This pushes back my release date to the end of 2009.

Our starting date is mid 1369 as the infamous Hellgate Keep is in the midst of being destroyed.\n\nWhile centered on the areas in the campaign sources known as \"The Savage Frontier\" and \"The North\" ... this world is constantly growing and it's our hope to incorporate areas such as the Anauroch Desert, The Sword Coast and The Spine of the World in time.\n\nWhile primarilly an RP Server. We do not define \"RP\" as sitting around towns all day. There are no XP limits per day or other limitations requiring you to stay in town \"x\" amount of time. Most players RP as \"Adventurers\" after all. Not shift workers at the local mill or farmhands. We fully expect players to make characters that will get off that bar stool and go adventure and be the Heroes or Villians they were meant to be. Non-adventurering characters are welcomed (dedicated bookworms,seamstresses, smiths, etc...),but will be dependant on DM notice for XP and rewards often.\n\nCome and join with us today and have a role in molding this already great world of ours.\n\nOther Haks required:\nCEP 2.3 (latest version always)\nLink\n\nComplete City/Rural\nLink\n\nUnderdark Caverns\nLink\n\nVersatile Dungeon\nLink\n\nSpider Caves\nLink\n\nCLassic Dungeon\nLink\n\nUnique Features include:\n- Armor/Clothing Dummies to create your custom look IG (Free of charge)\n\n- Free Cloak Changer to select a different cloak appearance for any cloak.\n\n- Appearance changer so you can actually use those nice CEP Heads ... no head override required with ours.\n\n- XP and GP Costs for scribing scrolls, brewing potions and making wands is reduced from the standard pricing most places.\n\n- Most potions can be brewed using spells up to 5th level here. Some minor potions can be created by combining various forageables as well.\n\n- Most Wands can be made to accept spells up to the 6th level here. Wands here need to be equipped inorder to be used.\n\n- Custom Deity System: Based on the Forgotten Realms sourcebooks, deity choice can affect gameplay options for your character.\n\n- \"Voiceless\" Language and Emote System in use.\n\n- Custom Emote based Cantrips and Minor Spells for both Arcane and Divine Casters.\n\n- Unique and random \"summoned\" creatures. Druids and Rangers have their own unique summons. Many Cleric Domains have summons that better represent them. Necromacers have their own special summons.\n\n- Clerics can Turn/Destroy or Rebuke/Dominate undead based on alignment here\n\n- \"Camping\" placeables such as tents, campfires and cookpots for use with our resting system. \n\n- Mining for ore and gems.\n\n- Lot's of foraging for foods and useful herbs. Cooking of meals is also enabled and recipes grow with each update often. (There is no hunger or thirst system. Consumables are for RP purposes and restore a small amount of HP at times only.)\n\n- Random NPCs and Guards. Our scripted \"Commoners\" and \"Guards\" in various towns constantly change names and appearances enabling a fluid crowded feel to many areas without having to create thousands of NPCs.\n\n- Random Weapons on encountered creatures and enhanced AI scripting. Most of the semi-intelligent hostile encounters will spawn in with a random weapon and/or armors. This makes each encounter a fresh one and helps promote adventuring concepts like diverse parties and advance scouting and planning for each battle.\n\n- Unique Environmental scripting. Crossing streams, charging through brambles and other things here could have consequences if not careful.\n\n- Improved animal AI's so that skittish creatures flee when they spot you and most wild animals only attack when cornered or a player lingers too long and too close to them.\n\n- Charisma and Persuade add a bonus to appraise when dealing with some merchants.\n\n- Scaled Adventuring Areas. Most encounters will scale to your parties abilities. Some few areas are closed after you've reached a level in excess of the challenges, leaving more for new players to do and encouraging players to expand their explorations of the world.\n\n- Unique Random Encounter System that makes traversing most wilderness areas a new experience each time.\n\n- XP bonus for parties. To encourage group play and RP we give a small bonus to possible xp gained when in a group.\n\n- Player Run Guilds. \n\n- 400+ current areas for your adventuring. (expanding weekly)\n\n- Many unique creatures seldom seen elsewhere. (Xvarts, Bullywugs, etc...)\n\n- Expanded Armor and Weapon Crafting as well as Magical Item Creation inspired by the DMG rules. (Requires materials, skills, sometimes feats as well as an XP and GP cost to make items under our enhaced system)\n\n","Rating":10,"Votes":21,"Awards":[]},"1250":{"Title":"Eternal Destiny","Author":"Eternal Destiny Team","Submitted":20090423,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"None / Freeform","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://thedestiny.3.forumer.com/[/url","Number Players":"1-25","Setting":"World of Eternal Destiny","Length":"Unlimited","Number DMs":"6 DMs Located Around the Globe","IPs":"PW Action","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Classes":"All Classes and 60+ Subraces","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"1-40","Magic Level":"High","Schedule":"24/7/365","Treasure":"High","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"All Alignments Welcome and Supported","Experience Rewards":"Moderate to High","Races":"All Races including 60+ Letoscripted Subraces","PVP":"Mixed","ApplicationReqs":"No Applications Required and everything is available to all.

As such, neverwinter serves as it's main trade partner - with the occasional competition from Luskan. Nothing, it could be said is unusual about that - many an island is located off of the sword coast. However, anphillia is soaked in blood, littered with bones and the site of a seemingly neverending war.\n\nThe story began several hundred years ago, in the most unlikliest place, aboard a slave ship bound for Luskan. The slavers were cruel folk, vicious and sadistic - their leader took the name of Olaf Axfell and he was not there out of need for money, or out of being forced but rather because he loved doing his job. He was one of the most notorious slave traders as well as sea captains of his time, renowned in Luskan for his brutality and the mixture of fear and discipline he instilled in both his crewmen and his cargo.\n\nNow, being one of the most renowned slave traders - it was most upsetting to him when he found a slave that he couldnt break, a slave that gave the others hope. A despicable insect, the most wretched creature he could hope to have obtained. A humble paladin. Being such as he was, competetive and stubborn to the highest degree, the sensible option of simply killing the paladin simply never occured to him. Instead the paladin was subjected to torture, almost continuous torture - the paladin did not sleep, did not eat and did not drink. Yet every day he would, between his involuntary screams, let loose a small prayer to his god and a small glimmer of hope would sparkle throughout the eyes of the captives.\n\nHope is a strange thing, it gives weak men strength, starving men food, purposeless men purpose and on that ship it instilled fear amongst the slavers. The glimmer in the captives eyes became a glow and whispers of plots became shouts. The paladin would not succumb and Olaf would not simply put an end to it. This would have gone on, perhaps, until the ship had reached Luskan at least, but it had no such luck. A ferocious storm, seemingly from nowhere hit the ship one night. Olaf was present and attending to the paladin at this point. As the shouts from deck erupted and the sound of crushing timber was heard, the paladin, with his last strength cracked a small smile and whispered something. Enraged by his words, whatever they were, Olaf finally snapped and drove a branding pole straight through the paladins chest before rushing out unto the deck. Some say that the paladin whispered prayer and that the storm was a divine act, but that is simply hear-say.\n\nWhat he saw next was absolute chaos, men lay crushed under fallen rigging - some slaves, some slavers. It was impossible to tell who was who in the fiersome weather. The storm still raged, men were thrown overboard and in amongst it all, the slaves were fighting - enraged, beating slavers with theirs fists, throwing themselves at their captors in a desperate plea for escape. Olafs men fought back, cutting them down with swords and axes in there dozens, but they could not keep the combined might of all the slaves back - one cannot cut forever. Olaf himself grabbed a piece of the splintered deck and struck out like a man possessed at anyone who approached him, be they friend or foe. Shouting, he was heard even over the raging storm.\n\n\"The Paladin is dead, you are finished, he is dead - I will kill every last one of you if I have too!\"\n\nThe fury in his eyes caused some to stop in their tracks, but as his words were spoken, they instilled a greater rage than before. He had killed their paladin, their friend - their saviour. All eyes were on him now and the slaves advanced, despite Olafs shouts and mighty swings of his quickly fashioned weapon.\n\nAs the storm subsided, the ship was left in a wreck - stained red with blood and littered with corpses of slavers and slaves alike - those that had not been washed overboard at least. Olaf had retreated to his cabin, with 4 dozen of the surviving slavers they held there easily - the bloodlust had faded from the slaves now and they had claimed the lower decks as their own.\n\nThings seemed to calm, but a general sense of unease rippled throughout everyone on the vessel. There was no rigging left, no way to sail anywhere - and noone willling to brave the deck to fashion anything to move them. They were at the mercy of the ocean.\n\nThey drifted for less than a day before anyone realised that food was an issue, how would they eat? What would they drink? - This problem was solved, it seemed some people had taken up residence within the ships hold and had managed to secure much of the food and grain - however, both slavers and slaves had hidden here during the chaotic events of the night before, neither had any interest to fight and an uneasy truce grew between them and both the slaves and Olafs men - one they couldnt paticularly deny, since they would be without food otherwise.\n\nThe ship washed around in the unforgiving currents of the sea of swords, going nowhere, or at least it seemed - the sharp crash of wood splintering and the large mass of rocks that crushed into the ship came as a suprise to everyone - they had hit land.\n\nImmediately, Olaf and his remaining slavers spilled unto the island, bloody footsteps of the slaughter that seemed so long ago marking there arrival in the sand - without so much as a glance back at the ship they dissapeared into the woods, cutting a bloody path through anything that stood in their way. They were weary and did not want to try their chances against the slaves, at least for the moment.\n\nNext to come where the slaves, carrying the strangely undecayed body of the paladin that had given them hope, that had given them their freedom. Not one person knew his name, but they carried him like the most fragile, precious thing they had ever possessed. They moved again into the forest - the body scaring off wolves, giant bears and strange creatures as if it were enchanted, the slaves passed through without incident. They buried the paladin in a clearing when they had the chance - a former scholar simply placed one word upon the headstone. \"Cleaven\" he explained that it meant saviour in a forgotten tongue, the slaves hero finally had a name.\n\nFinally, the few that had hidden emerged - their leader, by general consensus, was Erik Ranzington a sensible, down to earth son of a farmer. The forest did not look at all safe to him, so the people that followed him set about making a settlement on the shore and by his orders started repairs upon the ship that had brought them here.\n\nA year passed before the village of Ranzington, named in honour of there leader had finished repairs on the ship - they had heard no word of the people that had ventured into the forest and they presumed them dead. However they found the island, which they called Anphillia, to be a kind mistress - if one was carefull you could obtain vast quantities of precious minerals and metals that were worth a fortune back home. It was for this reason they held off returning to the mainland, they would make their fortunes here.\n\nThe people of cleaven were the first to make contact with the village - the years and the island had changed the slaves that the Ranzington people had once known, yet the light and strong sense of morales that the paladin had instilled in each and every one of them remained. They brought trade to the small village of Ranzington and were welcomed with open arms. Only ten-day later, the first of the Axfell clan made contact with Ranzington - they too brought trade but they also brought the problem of conflict with the cleavens.\n\nUpon learning of their survival Olaf and his men killed several of the former slaves within Ranzington, the bloodlust and ferocity of the attack sending chilling echoes of what had occured upon the slave ship all that time ago across the entire island. The conflict escalated - some of the neutral Ranzington people where killed, by both sides. Erik Ranzington frowned upon this, as any leader would - but in his wisdom he did not escalate the conflict further, rather he tried to resolve it.\n\nCleaven at this time was ruled by a council, Axfell still remained in the iron grip of Olaf - not even the Cleavens would admit any wrongdoing in their actions, perhaps something which would have been different had the paladin survived. Erik was able, with all his cunning and persuasion, to sit both sides around the same table - however even he could not persuade anyone to admit fault or to stop the pointless conflict. The Axfell in their rage and fury would not back down and the Cleavens, with their righteous mentality swore to hunt them till the end of their days. Needless to say, the conflict continued.\n\nYears passed, tales of slaughter, backstabbing and open combat played out upon the landscape of anphillia were common place. Both Axfell and Cleaven grew in strength, the only place they would simply not harm each other was in Ranzingtons make-shift wooden walls. This was only due to Lord Ranzington's decree and the several well armed, well trained guards which now lined Ranzingtons streets. As the ship, which had brought them here filled up with precious metals - it sailed back to the mainland and made port in neverwinter. It sold it's cargo as well as the story of anphillia to eager ears. Of course, when it returned it was loaded with many, many types of people. Those that lusted for power, war, fame, fortune or those that simply sympathised with the warring factions.\n\nTo this day, Axfell and Cleaven still fight each other across the landscape of anphillia - riches, untold treasures, secrets and artefacts lay undiscovered beneath the bloody ground. Neither side has had the power or tact to overcome the other... but perhaps you can change that.\n","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"1258":{"Title":"DAY  1116","Author":"Builder_Anthony","Submitted":20090603,"Updated":20090604,"Category":"Hardcore Rules","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Number Players":"1-27","Setting":"Forgotten Realms Swamps","Number DMs":"1","IPs":"24.56.20.13:5121","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Heavy","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"1-18","Magic Level":"Moderate","Schedule":"10am to 3 am","Treasure":"Moderate","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","Races":"Drow welcome","PVP":"Full PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Permadeath","Connection":"Cable","House rules":"No loging during combat","Content Guide":"Everyone","Player Requirements":"Resting Food Water","RolePlay":"Medium","Guild link":"Link","Forums":"Link","Description":"A mountain slide has engulfed the town as the monsters peer in threw the city gates.Many have died and the city concil is struggling with the decision to either fight off the advanceing monster or to try and stop the sea hag that seeks the bones of the dracolich which lay in the woods guarded by the great druid.The city lies between the bones but what about the gates that lead to the swamp.With such a descision to make surely the concil will have many deaths on their hands.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1260":{"Title":"Skullport Legends","Author":"garrison, philip o'brien","Submitted":20090604,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"None / Freeform","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"url=http://skullportlegends.com/]SkullportLegends.com[/url","Number Players":"TBD","Setting":"Partly based on the Forgotten Realms Skullport/Undermountain Setting (~1370) but original content as well.","IPs":"skullportlegends.com:5121","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All classes welcome, dynamic spawn system scales creatures & loot to class weighted party levels.","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"4-40+ Everything scales to party level; some quests only available after level 40.","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","Schedule":"always on","Treasure":"High","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"Lawful Good won't always work well in Skullport proper, but anything goes in Undermountain!","Experience Rewards":"Moderate to High","Races":"Standard player races.

Set in a unique campaign world, the City of Closteria has risen slowly on the ruins of an ancient civilization destroyed by cataclysmic geological events over 1000 years ago - the cause of which is still unknown. New players will find themselves starting on the docks of the City of Closteria, newly arrived perhaps, from far lands in search of adventure. The city and river valley are areas of relative safety in a sea of increasingly dangerous and wild neighbors. Additionally, explorers will find that there is a world beneath the ground as complex and dangerous as the one above for many ancient secrets were swallowed by the earth during the great cataclysm.\n\nThe persistent world is implemented using NWNX2 and an SQL database. Using these tools and the content from the CEP many new game features have been added to provide adventures with new challenges and support for roleplay.\n\nFeatures:\n- Over 200 areas consistent with the world geography and climate, including underwater areas.\n- Persistent objects which allow bashable placeables and doors and resetting traps.\n- Implementation of climb, jump, swim, and dive skills and transitions.\n- New creature templates for variety and better challenges from base models as well as numerous unique special creatures. Over 500 at last count.\n- Hundreds of new item templates for many new magic items.\n- Revised experience system which scales rewards to encourage parties of similar level.\n- A fine grained alignment system, which allows far more acts to influence alignment over a longer period of time as well as �memory� of opposing acts. As time passes it becomes more difficult to change alignement.\n- A fine grained faction system which functions much like the alignment system allowing effects over longer periods of time.\n- Improvements to the Bard class, the bard's song has been increased in power, especially to the bard themselves. There are also new magic items which alter the effects of the bard song (e.g Pipes of Resonance which change the song damage from blunt to sonic)\n- Implementation of elemental wizard/sourcer domains which increases the power of arcane caster's with respect to one of the fundamental elemental domains: earth, wind, fire, and water.\n- Changes to allow rogues to get experience for use of their skills and for use of traps.\n- Skill items which allow players additional use of skills not accessable via the game interface.\n- Support for special swim/fly modes and support for wings and tails.\n- Custom death system which scales penalties for respawning with level. The respawn penalty also decays over real time.\n- Integration of several additional systems for more functionality. DMFI for languages and DM tools, Jasperre's AI for smarter monsters in some areas. The bloodsong/milambus clothing tailor.\n\nLimitations:\n- Class level is limited to level 20. This restriction will be raised once more content designed for epic level characters is in place. \n- The feat Devastating Critical is disabled for all player characters.\n- Some spells are limited in effect or conditions to provide better game play.\n\nRequires NWN+SOU+HOTU or Platinum/Diamond v1.69 as well as CEP v2.2.

Your team must complete arena specific quests, while blocking your rival's quest progression to gain access to the enemy fortress. Fantasy Fortress was never intended to be a \"Battle of The Builds\", All players who enter the arena will have their level restricted to 17, facilities to level up and remove levels are present. Dont be bashful, work in teams. Just remember if that the party becomes a horde of all your players, that there are other quests that you are neglecting to carryout. Individual kills are not rewarded, instead, the entire team receives sums gold for completing and holding quest locations. Gold can be spent at the fortress store on potions and other items, or gold can be horded till the end and spent on reward items that can pass freely through the portal. Read-on to examine each aspect of gameplay in detail.\n\nCapture Mana Sources - These provide your arch-wizard with magical resources so they can summon monsters and cast spell. The arch wizard has a number of different spell. Only arcane spell casters (Sorcerers, Wizards and Bards) can capture a mana sources however. During the capture countdown the spell caster will be vulnerable, and once they start they cannot abort the capture spell, so it is in the interest of the team's warriors to protect them. Mana is generated every 300 seconds (5mins) from time of capture, if the enemy retakes the source before then all progress is lost. Every time mana is generated the team is rewarded with a larger sum of gold. Success depends on your ability to retake points while holding on to them, with enough mana the arch wizard will easily be able to lay waste to the enemy fortress. \n\nCapture Guard Posts - Limit whos team can access a corresponding door. Controlling a guard post, will often force your rivals to take the long way round, taking pressure off of your mana sources. Anyone may capture a guardpost. Guard Posts also generate a minor amount of gold for the team.\n\nTeam Balance:\nTeams are assigned automatically when a player enters the arena. Players will be assigned to the team that most needs reinforcing, if this fails and one team drops below a half of the other teams strength, victory will be automatically awarded to the team with the greatest amount of mana.\n\nHenchmen:\nAn Npc called the Team Captain sell items and henchmen. These Henchman are reduced in level compared to players but are able capture mana sources.\n\nEnchantments and Gear:\nPlayers entering the arena portal will only be allowed to keep their equipped items. All other inventory, and gold will be removed. Make sure that you are prepared before entering! Equipped items will be stripped of all enchantments. Durring the match up players will be able to add enchantments based on a point system. Each player will have 100 points to start with to spend on enchantments rated by power and perceived usefulness. At anytime, enchantments can be removed or added at the globe of enchanting. Over the course of the game, players will be rewarded for quests in gold and more points to spend on enchantments. Items, such as potions, scrolls, can be bought from an Npc Team Captain. After the game, Players will have a another chance to spend their gold at the Reward Items Dealer. These are special items that retain their enchantments when moving through the arena portal.\n\nSummoned Monsters:\nMonsters can be summoned by the arch wizard, while weaker they often will out number players 2-1. Each monster type brings its own distinct advantages into play such as certain immunities.\n\nResting:\nPlayers may rest in the actual arena, however the default resting script has been modified to take longer, and make the player more vulnerable, i.e. find a safe place to nap!\n\n\nNo Movement or Attack Limitations?\nThere are no movement limitations other than those imposed the game; If you're a fighter expect weaker classes to flee in your terrifying wake! Here's an example of what to do instead of complain, team up with a wizard to cast hold on your mutual foes. If that fails your arch wizard can do it for a sum of mana! Currently every player is restricted to play a level 17 character, however this means that every enemy team player is a target!\n\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1280":{"Title":"Legends of Luruar","Author":"various","Submitted":20090925,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://talesofsm.11.forumer.com[/url","Number Players":"15","Setting":"The nation of Luruar in the Forgotten Realms","Length":"infinite","Number DMs":"seven","IPs":"38.96.174.50:5138","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"\"All standard classes are supported, with all prestige classes available upon request.\"","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"Levels 2-40, current averages are in the teens","Magic Level":"Moderate","Schedule":"24/7, 365.25","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Alignments":"all alignments supported","Experience Rewards":"Moderate","Races":"all standard nwn races supported,with standard subraces, others available upon application","PVP":"Mixed","ApplicationReqs":"Character Concept to pass 10th level, Prestige Class and Epic Applications.","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"25% Gold Loss on Death.\nChanges soon to 100 XP/Level on Death.","Connection":"T1+","House rules":"Libby's Rule: \"It's a Game.

We have eighteen working prestige classes, including Silverstar, Mystic Theurge, Bladesinger, and Duelist on top of the standard bioware implemented classes, most of which have undergone some changes to bring them in line with 3.5.\n\nWe rely heavily upon DM plots/quests to level and are focused upon roleplay and character development over grinding or PVP.

Feel free to try it out if it's running. But, here is some basic information.\n\nThe orgional concept was not made by me but, I was a editor of the scenario from Age of Empires 2. I redesigned it into a NWN module. I thought the idea was brilliant. It's a 7v1 type game where a hunter must kill 7 players before they destroy his wonder. If his wonder is destroyed, the builders win and if the builders are killed, hunter wins. It may not sound fair at first. However, the gameplay attempts to balance it. The builders can make walls, recruit units, or get effects to their character to help reach the wonder. However, doing this costs gold for them. They have very limited gold as well. If they don't use it wisely as a team, they will lose for sure. They have to follow a long pathway in order to reach the wonder though. But you might ask, \"What is keeping them from just running stright to the wonder and winning?\" Well, there are a number of things. There are 2 main gates that prevent continuing and wolves all around the path. If players destroy these gates, shortcuts open for the hunter. Make sure you are ready to move on before you destroy the gate. Also, since players start out very low in level, they all get +1k HP. But, if they are killed, they are out of the round and must wait until the next round. You might also ask, \"What is preventing the builders just killing the hunter?\" Well, he's set to plot. (takes no damage) So, don't bother attacking him...\n\nAnyway, that is the basic description of the module. Balancing will alway be an issue. I am slowly working on it...

It requires no Hak packs to play. It is quite different from most modules, in fact there is no module like it in NWN. Don't be turned off by the phrase high magic, everything is well balanced and challenging. Some things that make this module stand out are the hundreds of areas which are well designed, beautiful areas with great atmosphere which is a breath of fresh air from areas that are long, empty and seem to stretch on. There are hundreds and hundreds of custom creatures, thousands of custom items and even some custom spells and abilities.\n\nThe story takes place around the city of Midgard. There are many people talking about the giants who came from the north, trying to conquer the land. Midgard has a fort where they keep the giants at bay, but they don't know how long they can last and the giants seem endless. While the soldiers are fighting, bandits have decided to prey upon the innocent. Travelling has become quite dangerous, and the number of monsters around the continent are growing at an alarming rate. There is a slight norse mythology influence here, but there are also other influences. \n\nIn this module, heavy plates offer physical damage protection and low levels of AC, while the lighter armors offer more AC but less protection. It makes you decide between being able to dodge a little more, or being hit a bit more but taking less damage, or a mixture of the two using a light armor or a chainmail. Weapons are balanced out a bit, and there are weapons of just about any main type. You won't just see scimitar/kukri/rapier/scythe users here. Even spears, halberds, etc all have their uses. Weapon damages are based on the type of weapon. Generally two handers do the most damage, exotic STR melee weapons come in second, followed by other STR weapons and then followed by finesse weapons. \n\nWhile the original NWN has these same ideas to an extent, this module does it on a much larger scale. Specialize in a weapon but can't seem to be lucky enough to find one in the dungeons yet? Make one in the forge and upgrade it with various materials. Spellcasters don't have to worry about being left behind, since there are uncapped, custom spells here as well. All classes in this module are useful, even lesser played ones like Harpers, Druids or Bards. Skills like open lock and heal can be quite useful, in fact some chests and certain areas can only be reached by picking locks. While there are potions in the module, they are MUCH more expensive. \n\nParty play is recommended but you can also enjoy things solo. For those of you who don't like hacking and slashing your way through dungeons and finding loot....there is plenty for you to do. There are mini side quests, areas to explore, or you can just kick back in the tavern, share stories and drink with some friends. We are currently working on player housing and player owned buildings to increase the roleplay/social aspects of the game. \n\nRoleplaying isn't mandatory here, but is welcome. There are classic rpg elements here. You will learn a lot by talking to the npcs and reading things you come across. So far this module has been up a week and has attracted regulars. A good portion of people who try this module are instantly hooked. It's a breath of fresh air to them, there is plenty to do, it's challenging, it's balanced, and its unlike anything they ever played before. I could talk about Realms of Midgard forever really, but the best way is to come see for yourself.\" \n\n- Dante","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1288":{"Title":"Dor Maeglin","Author":"Dor Dev Team","Submitted":20091022,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Epic","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://www.dormaeglin.com[/url","Number Players":"40","Setting":"Custom realm of Dor Maeglin.

What is it? It's a safe place for people to come role play, character build and kick the stuffing out of some Hell spawned monstrosity with delusions of dominion. \n\nWho You Are: For reasons of your choosing, as a young adult, you enrolled into the Adventurer's Guild, where you apprenticed into the time honored tradition of Adventuring. After several years of training, you have now just graduated.\nAs a recent graduate and Novice Adventurer, you find yourself thrust out into a world rife with wonder and terror. A world on the brink of annihilation by an enemy foreign to our shores.\n\nHistory In Brief: Long ago, around a distant star, upon a far away and fabled world, the goddess, Mystryl sacrificed herself to set right the forces over which, the evil archmage Karsus sought dominion. At the climax of that epic struggle, the goddess destroyed herself to shatter the source of Karsus's power - the artifact known as the Mythallar. Karsus, himself was petrified, imprisoned in living stone for all eternity, buried beneath the ruins of his tyrannical empire.\nThe Mythallar and its pieces were scattered to the far flung corners of the universe and despite what you think you may know - the world of Faerun was not the only world devastated by the death of the Goddess of Magic. \nThe eruption of chaotic energies her death created, very nearly destroyed the world of Icarus as well. \nThe hardy Icaran folk did survive however, and had scarcely begun to rebuild when a new and even greater danger arrived on their world and it has been bloody red war every day since.\nIn the modern era, the people of Icarus have rebuilt and work to fortify their island holdfast against this darkness, whilst employing the young and brave to thwart the Enemy and discover the Mythallar pieces lest they fall into the hands of their foe.\nThis darkness, the Enemy, of which bedtime tales are told, has a name but the free and noble tongue dare not speak it. They simply call him, One Eye and it is the Legions of Hell that follow him.\n\nWhat You Do: As an Adventurer, it is your duty and sacred trust to combat this menace, by whatever means you are able. \n\nThe rule set is dynamic, evolving, involving and fun.

But this will also bring you a bunch of troubles: \nMany people will dislike you, some may, and shall, even attempt to your life.\nBeing a cop in the street of a metropolis in 2036 is a dangerous job, as you'll discover soon enough...\n\n/The Mod/\nWoT is built using the Dark Horizon Core Rules System, which is my final attempt at creating a ruleset that is far from the NWN's original one and that fits my needs. Those who have played on my former PWs and tested my different rulesets might be surprised to see how far I have reached this time.\nIt might be very difficult to get started, but intense reading of the Survival Guide should help. ^_^\nThis is a cyberpunk-themed world, so there are many things to get familiar with, such as CyberWare and advanced technology, weapon systems, etc.\n\nThe mod is still in development and receives daily updates, though it is playable, and will obviously require beta testing.\nI am not going to put the mod online for now, except for testing sessions or casual roleplay.\n\n/THE SCOPE/\nAt this early stage of the mod, you are intended to play a cop, but you may also play what you want [civilian, ganger, terrorist, etc] though it might turn boring because of the lack of content for those. As the mod expands, many more possibilities will be given and playing a cop to enjoy the mod would no longer be a requirement. The mod may even turn into a PW at times.\n\nFor now, as a cop, you are part of the SecForce, and given a rank. Your goal beside roleplaying with other cops and living your daily life is to complete missions. These missions range from arresting suspects to fighting gangers, investigations, counter-terrorism, etc.\nThese missions are re-playable and grant you Faction Points if they are succeeded, which are needed to raise in rank. You are also given Requisition Points, which are spent to requisition equipment from the SecForce. Your rank and the Requisition Cost being a limit to what you may requisition.\n\n/RULES/\nYou may want some reading, so get the Survival Guide and the Arms & Equipment Guide from there: Link\nThese are very far from being complete, but you will learn enough to get started.\nThe rules within these guides are from my DHCRS, and all the rules do not necessarily apply to War on Terror, such as the alien species and magic [except Psi Force, maybe ;)].\n\n/WHAT I NEED/\nWell, I just need people to test my mod out, and maybe future players. ^_^\nOtherwise, I might need a mapper, because I am skilled in almost every part of mod-building, but the one I despise the most is mapping! ^,.,^\n\n/CREDITS/\nToo much people to be credited here for their custom content. So I'll specifically credit the D20 Modern Team for their outstanding job at creating modern/scifi stuff. :)","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1300":{"Title":"Gehinom - PW of Hardcore Horror Role Play","Author":"Hierophant - Devari","Submitted":20100103,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://gehinom.freebb3.net/index.php[/url","Number Players":"15-25","Setting":"Original World - based on the works of HP Lovecraft, The Song of Ice and Fire series, the old Faerie Lore - and other folktales and dark cultural narratives.","Length":"Persistent World","Number DMs":"2+","Scope":"Large","Hack & Slash":"Light","Classes":"Restrictions on Wizards, Sorcerers, and Paladins.

For the shivering mortals, huddled by the imagined safety of their hearths, this is a world fraught with more danger than even a nightmare could create.\n\n Yes here wander the beasts spoken of in legend: the ever-thirsting undead that survive off of living blood, the howling beasts that rage through the overgrown forests, the murmuring warlocks who become mad as their power increases. Hunters- fueled by righteous anger and steadfast in their belief of the Almighty- struggle against overwhelming odds, and the remains of their battles are stepped over by those who have triumphed, and only fellow hunters mark their passing.\n \n These are the remains of the city known once as Nebari. These are the small communities that still cling to life in the difficult circumstances brought- not only by the meagre resources of the Dark Ages and the environment- by the pervasive darkness that lurks even in the brilliant candlelight. Here the unnatural creatures battle one another. In the shadowy alleyways and paved streets of the small villages, the supernatural emerges to fight the unseen, unknown and impervious force that keeps them trapped. On this island, escape has been made impossible, and as these are beings considered mythic by the world of Man, they know no such thing as \"impossible.\" They struggle, and in that, become fueled by increasing rage as they battle despair.\n\n Life is cheap. Honour is a laughable concept. Morals exist only in the dry books of scholars, and if there is a shining light to be found at all- is it that thing so many call by the name 'love?'- those who recognize it find that it is more delicate than Venetian glass. In this world, a crime is only such by name if it is witnessed, and the invisible eyes that watch the island's inhabitants play their games seem to care naught for justice.\n\n This is Romsa Displaced- a city in the World of Darkness, lost to the Dark Ages- and although no sign will read as such upon entering, be warned, wary traveler, that all hope should be abandoned upon crossing its' borders. Better to lose such a delusion than have it torn from you in the depths of the night...\n\nOur Module is currently in the beta stages we are working towards a final release but you are invited to join us in our test module during our test.

It was a relative time of peace, discovery and prosperity for all.\nScholars and primitive astrologist, had predicted a cosmic event of the heavens, of which the Empiric Over-Lord had widely ignored.\n\nWhen this event happened, it changed our world forever, and irrevocably. The Glorian Empire, though still intact in a much lesser degree, was more or less shattered from with-in.\n\nThis cosmic event was called Star-Fall. Literally, the major stars seen in the night sky, shifted their locations quickly, and one... a close Red-colored star, shot towards the world, exploding close, and sending fragments of it's body, and energy to bombard the world.\nWhat caused this phenomenon is still a mystery at best, but scholars studying the event, along with historians, have agreed the Red Star, wasn't a Star at all, but a small planet , that reflected the red light of our Sun in the sky.\n\nAs the energy and fragments bombarded the surface of the world, vast changes started happening. The first notable changes, was that of magic, and powers developing from normal every-day people. Though, most of these people, quickly became ill, both physically, and mentally... there was no denying the things they could do.\nSecondly... the appearance of Dragons, and other monsters. Somehow, these strange energies from the fallen star, created these creatures. What they did not kill... these energies changed.\n\nThis went on for thousands of years, as the world adjusted and adapted.\n\nThe Red Star, was labeled \" The Demon Star\", for it was later known it's energy caused the source of the magic, and power that changed our world, but.. it was inherently poisonous, and thus why people died, became infirm, or went insane that manifested it's powers.\nEventually it was discovered, that beings that manifested the Powers and magics, simply collected the raw energy from the Demon Star energy still in our atmosphere and embedded in our earth. To escape the illnesses, and other horrid fates it caused, our peoples learned that by using this energy and power up, purged us enough that our bodies can maintain decent health, but always, always.. the cycle repeats itself, inevitable it is, the poisonous Demon Star Energy, soaks into us no matter what we do.\nThere are those that are immune to the energy, what causes this is unknown, and to this date, it cannot be duplicated even by magic.\n\nThis is the state of our world now. Bombarded by cosmic energy, we either harness, use and purge, or face extinction , giving the world to the monsters, creatures, abominations and dragons of the world.\n\nIn this age, the Glorian Empire barely is held together, what's left of it. More like an allied collection of independent city-states than an Empire, since the Over-Lord was slain.\nIt was said the Over-Lord was immortal, and had existed for thousands of years. This changed when a unknown swordsman appeared one day, carrying a blade, forged from the metal of the Demon-Star, from fragments that penetrated our world when it exploded.\nDriven mad from the corrupting energy in the blade, it was never found out who forged the vile weapon, or how it came to the hands of the unknown swordsman.\n\nThe blade was named the Genisis Sword, for with one mortal blow, started a chain reaction that shook the Glorian Empire, and further changed it forever.\nSince the Over-Lord's demise, no other Over-Lord has stepped into his place. At best, the Empire has elected an acting Emperor at times, but such person is more a figure head, that tyrant ruler.\n\nAfter the Over-Lord was slain, the swordsman flung the weapon off the great cliffs, into the sea. After he was caught by the remaining Imperial Guard, questioned, tried and executed him, no other information about the Genisis Sword , or it's origins have ever surfaced.\n\nDuring our age here, in these desperate and dark days, as our Empire crumbles around us, a new Empire is rising across the Seas. They call themselves the Psarsym, and are evil, cruel, malicious.. and seek to conquer, or destroy our Empire utterly. Psarsym are masters of magics, powers, and mind powers. It is rumored, it was their ancestors that created the Genesis Blade, and sent it to our lands to destroy our glorious Empire. The Psarsym ally themselves with vile creatures, evil dragons, demons, and devils alike, nothing is sacred to them. Their lands are as black as their hearts, and their plague is slowly consuming the world under their rule, or obliterated in their wake.\n\nWelcome to our World, the changed world. Welcome to the last days of our glorious Empire.\nLest heroes rise up, and ... combat the inevitable dark tide, about to crush down on us all.\n\n~ Written by Anonymous Scholar and Historian~ \" \n\n That being said, Glorian Empire boast a fair amount of new and exciting aspects, such as new abilities, powers, and class additions not standard in the original NWN content. \n Going beyond level 40 , unlocks new content and things to partake in. \n It's a big world, with tons of areas to explore, adventure , and role-play in. \n\n We ARE a communal role-playing server, that actually does have it's fair share of combat as well. \n\nIt is NOT cannon material, not Forgotten-Realms, Not Grey-hawk... it's it's own unique world and Universe.\nIt's.. for a lack of any other way to describe it.. different. Very different, yet ... familiar as it is a DnD game on NWN... as much as it fits into that category. As such.. not everything is set in stone, and along the way there will be decisions, plots, and things added to make it a more \"solid\" world.. as it unfolds to the community.\n\n\nHopefully, you'll enjoy the mod, and stick around for countless hours of fun, and RP.\nLook forward to seeing you IG.\n\nSome features:\n-Special combat options resembling console RPG.\n-Deep \"Tech\" combat system, including martial techs, special summons, stances, Spell Art, Divine Sorcery, Demon Seals, etc.\n-A real-time sailing system\n-Muskets and cannons\n-Special combat events, like Weapon Locks and movie-styled Instant Kills.\n\nSome additions:\n-\"Raid\" and \"Hydra\" scenarios when you go sailing.\n-An improved Arena system in Adrian.\n-The rare \"Flash Chain\" combat scenario.\n-A \"bloody finish\" for you corn syrup freaks out there who can get a monster below -50HP.\n-High elemental damage also causes secondary effects.\n-Upgraded firearm system\n-The \"Fame\" and \"Reputation\" system is also added \n\nI forgot to mention.. i'm classifying the new hosted version as an RP/Action PW.\n\nRP coming first, and meaning..., role-playing. The development of a persona, both imaginative and fictional, that reacts, changes, and grows ... and exist with-in the plots and environments set forth. Player to player interaction, is a must to get the full enjoyment from the game.\n\nAction being secondary only to RP... lets face it, the staple of any DnD game is lots and lots of combat. This module, could very well be played, with-out a hint of RP in it, granting hours and hours of mindless combat and grinding. I'd rather not have it as such... so, stay in character, and take time to interact with others when given a chance to please.\n\nI think, the combination of the above... makes for a great PW.\n\nWith the additions of powers , maneuvers and abilities... , there's just so much more to this PW than almost anything else out there. Lots of content, doesn't even unlock, or isn't possible with-out being level 40.\n\nThere's no illegal combos of classes here, you may opt to power-build if you choose to. With the additions, it seems anyone and everyone will be some sort of powerbuild anyways... , there's nothing wrong with having a strong character.\n\nThough, like with any RP PW... I'd want to see players creating a character, and sticking to their concepts from level 1 all the way beyond to 40.\nYou may have as many PCs as you wish to play. \n\n The server has to be direct connected , it does not show up in game spy. \n\n Join us, have fun, and hope you enjoy it!","Rating":10,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"1305":{"Title":"Genesis Nordock","Author":"Superfly_2000","Submitted":20100209,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"url]http://www.nwngenesis.com[/url","Number Players":"Up to 64","Setting":"Forgotten Realm:ish","IPs":"(See website)","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Magic Level":"Moderate","Schedule":"24/7","Treasure":"Moderate","Experience Rewards":"Moderate","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"See the homepage.","House rules":"See the homepage.","Player Requirements":"See the homepage.","RolePlay":"Medium","Guild link":"Link","Forums":"Link","Description":"This server has been reborn again.

With a solid year's work put in it's mostly stable and ready to roll.\n\nAnphillia is a Role Play and PvP module involving two player forts at war, the good aligned Cleaven and the Evil Axfell. The never ending goal of defeating the opposing fort involves scouring the island facing its beastly inhabitants to acquire craftable resources to win the arms race. In the process, expect to face terrible battles unlike any dime-a-dozen kiddie server where you always win, and always be on guard for the opposing fort. skirmishes and all-out battles are to be expected as both sides seek out rare materials!\n\nThink: MMORPG comes to NWN with greater immersion, a smaller community, and DMs to keep things in order. A good game going can certainly become addictive.\n\nAnphillia has certainly be done before though, so what's different?\n\n-Every area will be rebuilt when all is said and done. Already both forts and every sub map has been rebuilt to exacting standards for immersion and quality. (Don't believe me? See the screen shots!) Roughly a score more areas have been rebuilt or added from scratch thus far using the latest CEP.\n\n-Balanced PvP with as little change to the core system as is practical. There are spell changes, but I'm sticking to the concept that less is more. Spells generally match their old functions as closely as possible, and generally only spells with firm problems are altered. (Bigby's, Greater Missile Storm, Harm, etc.) Tweaks, not a rebuild of the entire system.\n\n-The badly flawed \"low magic\" concept is dead, and I've aimed for a more standard level of magic for the FR setting. All CNR and loot items have been completely overhauled down to every last detail with equipment reaching +4 in power. Essentially the server's goal guideline are +1 per 5 PC levels. (+ to AC, enchantment, etc.) Stacking has been controlled through available items to prevent insanely high abilities, saves, skills, or other troublesome imbalances. Note that this doesn't mean \"epic\" equipment and levels, but a happy medium between the abusively paltry gear of 3.0 and the maxed out uber Anphillia servers running to level 40.\n\n-Smarter rules, not harder rules. Rather than forbid soloing to prevent ninja looters, you'll have a tough time sneaking to any chest undetected. Why restrict players endlessly when a few keystrokes can solve the core problems cleanly? Micromanagement, haphazard and ineffective draconian rules, and sloppy work are out. To quote eyesolated, one of Anphillia's original builders, \"if you can't script it, don't make it a rule\". Indeed.\n\n-Punks need not apply. A lot goes on the server, but not everything. Problem players will be removed if they arise. Good players deserve a pleasant server.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1309":{"Title":"La Marca Argéntea","Author":"La Marca Argéntea","Submitted":20100321,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"url]http://www.marcaargentea.net[/url","Number Players":"50","IPs":"marcaargentea.game-host.org","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Level Range":"1-40","Magic Level":"Moderate to High","PVP":"Mixed","Vault Type":"Server","RolePlay":"Heavy","Forums":"Link","Description":"Servidor de rol basado en la región \"La Marca Argéntea\" de Faerun, el servidor recrea unas de las zonas más variadas de este mágico mundo... aunque también de las más peligrosas.\n\nDesde el desierto del Anaurokh a las tierras nevadas del norte, pasando por la fortaleza enana de Adbar o la temible ciudad drow de Menzoberranzan.\n\nDecide si quieres ser una poderosa clériga de batalla drow, o un caballero de la legión argéntea. \n\nEl módulo incluye:\n\n- Más de 500 áreas\n- 12 Clases de prestigio nuevas como Archimago o Adepto sombrío. \n- Más de 100 nuevos conjuros\n- Libros de conjuros para guardia negro, asesino o agente arpista\n- Más de 80 nuevas dotes \n- 25 nuevas razas y subrazas: drows, elfo solar, duergars, etc...\n- Un sistema de oficios que te permitirá crear cualquier tipo de armas y dotarlas de extraordinarios poderes.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1310":{"Title":"Wake","Author":"Wake Team","Submitted":20100410,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"url]http://www.nwnwake.com/[/url","Number Players":"50","Setting":"Custom area of The Forgotten Realms","Number DMs":"5","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Light","Classes":"Some restricted classes","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"2-6","Magic Level":"Low","Number Servers":"1","Alignments":"All alignments","Races":"Some restricted races","PVP":"Full PvP","ApplicationReqs":"Application required","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Permanent","Connection":"100 Mbps","RolePlay":"Heavy","Description":"Arrested, tried, imprisoned, then bound and gagged, their next view of the sky and taste of fresh air is the moment the sack tied around their head is pulled off by the handlers, a rough group of grizzled mercenaries and seamen. A hired ship hauls them close to a cliff-lined shore, moving fast through the broiling waters of an undercurrent.\n\nThe handlers say nothing as those condemned are lead to the aft end of the ship. The rope that binds their hands is cut free and they are unceremoniously thrown from the stern, tumbling through the air.\n\nMen, women, human and demihuman alike are thrown into these waters, pulled under by the currents, whipped around and disoriented. The knowledge that they are dead to the world, left behind to be forgotten, given to the wilds of that place becomes realized. Knowing that their worth to the world outside is gone. The only common thread between them is their sentence, handed down by courts across the land, for any crimes those courts saw fit to recognize.\n\nNow, their life as before is no more. Their family and friends will move on, their crimes will be marked down and stowed away in dusty tomes.\n\nWill they continue their degradation? Will they seek redemption? Will they seek absolution from their crimes, or were they guilty at all?\n\nThe churning undercurrents and wakes of those ships can wash away as much or little of this past as they see fit.\n\nWelcome to Wake.\n\n-= Server Vision =-\n\nWake is aimed at reclaiming the quality of roleplay and the feeling of community that embodied the early days of Neverwinter Nights Roleplay Persistent Worlds. It is an attempt to put aside the cynicism and disappointment that many of us have found ourselves in since the advent of NWN2 among the many servers that never quite measured up to our expectations. Wake is our last attempt to reclaim the enjoyment of our shared hobby and create a server where engaging and high-quality roleplay is the standard and players are free to prance around pretending to be elves in an environment that reacts to their choices and actions. But seriously...\n\nWake is our attempt to recreate the traditional RP PW. Our aim is to take all of the things that made HAZE successful and create an enjoyable, high-RP server, to feed the addiction we all seem to have with online roleplaying.\n\n-= Setting =-\n\nWake will be set in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting in order to take advantage of the fact that the majority of players are already familiar with the setting. It is expected that the FR setting will have little impact on Wake beyond providing a common background to the characters as well as the religious pantheons available.\n\nWake takes place on an unnamed continent being used as a Penal Colony by various nations and organizations throughout Faerun. New players arrive to the colony by sea, being thrown overboard from their prison ships near enough to the coast for them to swim the remaining distance. The players will immediately be given control of a failed settlement near the coast, and from there they will be left to their own devices to survive or perish upon the hostile continent as their actions see fit.\n\n-= Features =-\n\nPermadeath - When a PC dies, he is dead forever. Deaths in game really matter, and taking care of your PC is extremely important. Personal relationships with other players through RP becomes dramatically more meaningful.\n\nE6 Leveling system - PCs enter the game at level 2, and will take approximately a month of normal play time to reach the max level of 6. After reaching 6, XP will continue to be gained, but rather than gaining another level, the player will choose a new feat for their character. This allows for a much wider variety of character options than lower levels, while maintaining a simple level 6 average balance to the world.\n\nCrafting - Wake uses the Craftable Natural Resources crafting system. Players will harvest resources in the wild, use them to build equipment, based on crafting XP and CNR levels (gained by successfully completing recipes) through a closed system. No character sheet skill points or feats required.\n\nPlayer Driven Experience - The main goal of the Wake team from the start was to create a very player-centric, engaging experience. Players can expect to see traditional DM plots from time to time, though the focus of Wake is to take the bulk of DMing away from grand metaplots and intricate NPC factions, and move it toward reacting to PC actions and working with players to drive PC-initiated plots. Players will be encouraged to initiate plots, create and join factions, and cause RP friendships, tension and drama between each other. Players in Wake will be expected to have the maturity to manage the In Game tensions, and the team can be expected to treat them as such.\n\nBuild Requests - Players in a position of RP influence can petition physical changes to the module, at the cost of in game special resource harvests. Clay, Stone, and Lumber (CLS) items are available throughout the setting to harvest and spend.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1311":{"Title":"Middle Earth Role Play","Author":"Olander","Submitted":20100410,"Updated":20100411,"Category":"Epic","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Number Players":"1-40","Setting":"LoTR","Length":"Endless","Number DMs":"3-5","IPs":"Pending","Scope":"Dependant on Module","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Tricks & Traps":"Light","Level Range":"3-40","Magic Level":"Moderate","Treasure":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"Occasional DM Needed","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","PVP":"Mixed","Vault Type":"Server","Connection":"100 Mbps","Content Guide":"Everyone","RolePlay":"Medium","Description":"Great Role Play, fantastic graphics, amazing quests, epic dungeons and endless fun!","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1312":{"Title":"Visions in Darkness","Author":"C_aribou","Submitted":20100415,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Capture The Flag","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Website":"url]http://www.vid.atforums.net[/url","Number Players":"45","Description":"Module Description:\nAbove and below the East Wall of Halruaa centuries of conflict have come to a boil.

I don�t usually post as I am more of a private offline LAN gamer. \n\nI love NWN 1. I love what people have done with hakpaks , they have created a whole new game, just to mention lord of worms and 666 as 2 of my heros.\n\nI started playing role-playing games from being 9 years old with my brothers, over the years I have tried different systems. With the aid of NWN I guess I have of created a synergy between electronic gaming and tabletop with buddies. Basically NWN handles the mechanics, but the DMFI can give me so many things to allow them to do out of the box actions. Conversations are also handled out of the game as are major party decisions, but other than that NWN gets to shine. For me this type of game far excels any MMPORG or even any NWN public server. �Nuverworld� sucks as a world name but it�s the one I started with way back then.\n\nSo to get to the point , a couple of games back , one of the 6 players could not make it in person , so we brought him in on the internet with voice conferencing and a connection to the game through game-spy. It worked great, he could talk with all in the room and they could hear him. It was like he was sat with us. \n\nSo this might be a bit random but I would like to see if I can recruit maybe 1-3 additional online players to virtually join the group. The next game will be on Sat 25th of Sept 2010 at about 10am GMT for several hours, but they take place about every month on a Fri evening about 7pm GMT to 11pm. FYI , I am based near Manchester in the UK.\n\nThat would be plenty of time for me to get the hak-paks to you and fill you in with the background, and how we might approach the voice set-up etc.\n\nI appreciate there is not much to go on here for a feel of the game , I am going to do a blog at some-point , but if you miss being around a table with your friends , discussing together how you are going to talk your way out of this impossible encounter , this might be for you. \n\nChris\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1328":{"Title":"Masks of Venice {NWN}","Author":"Neko","Submitted":20100819,"Updated":20110122,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Works on all versions","Website":"odmasksofvenice.darkbb.co","Number Players":"1-40","Setting":"The World of Darkness as viewed through the eyes of Renaissance Venice.","Number DMs":"Current: 4","IPs":"75.97.230.38:5121","Staff Requirements":"Fair, equitable, willing to do things for the sake of story and not \"character win.\"","Scope":"Dependant on Module","Hack & Slash":"Light","Classes":"Base classes permitted; Prestige Classes must be requested with an In Character reason.","Tricks & Traps":"Dependant on Module","Level Range":"1-40 {Average Level Currently: 8}","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Schedule":"24/7- server running: login at will.","Treasure":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"No DM Required","Alignments":"Alignments are used to reflect character- standard NWN class requirements {Lawful Good for Paladin, etc.} still stand.","Experience Rewards":"Low to Moderate","Races":"All races are considered a variant of human- subraces are scripted.","PVP":"Full PvP","ApplicationReqs":"Supernatural characters must be requested on the forums- DM acceptance ensures the character will have scripted subrace widgets.","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"HCR rules- 30% XP loss on death; level loss possible.","Connection":"ISDN","House rules":"Yes- respect the DMs and each other.","Content Guide":"Mature","Player Requirements":"Any and all players welcome.","RolePlay":"Heavy","Forums":"wodmasksofvenice.darkbb.com","Description":"In the World of Darkness, few lights shine to give those creeping through the shadows hope.

Use your common sense people!\n\nThis will most likely solve a lot of problems on the server. Is something not right? Then please don't start yelling like a baby. We don't know your age but we expect you to act as grownup while you are on this server. Even though you might not be an adult yet, just know that childish tantrum is not going to be Tolerated. And will not be appreciated by your fellow players as by the DM's (so not really a reason to act like a spoiled brat now is it?)\nIf there are any problems then we strongly ask you to try to try to solve it in a civil way. If all your diplomatic attempts seem to fail then you can always ask a DM or an ADMIN to help you solve the issue.\n\n2. Respect.\n\nYou know the sentence that sais: \"treat your fellow player like you would want to be treated\" when you are loading an area? Well that is EXACTLY what we want to have here.\nWe all want to have a nice world to play in, and we all work on it togheter so show other players and DM's the respect you want to be given.\nJust stay civil an polite in any In Character and Out of Character dealings.\n(So no childish tantrum or discrimination of any kind!!) That means either in the game itself as on the forums so please keep this all in mind people.\n\"You get the respect you give to others\"\n\n3. PVP conflicts and PC to PC interactions and such.\n\nPlayer to player interactions on Out Character should be dealt with in rule number 2. In Character, everything goes, with the only acception that the other player must agree to it to PVP. Or the permission of a Dm if it is a quest or whatever.\nThough keep in mind that you need to set the PC on hostile before entering PVP. Once the battle has started then everyone can join in. Once the combat or pursuit has ended and the encounter is over then the players must ask permission again.\n\n4. Stay In Character.\n\nThis is a roleplaying server and so we expect that all characters are \"IN CHARACTER\"\nOf course we won't ban you for having some OOC fun, since this is afterall just a game! But we do ask everyone to keep it to a minimum since everyone can RP to their best. If you -really- have to make OOC comments then please do it so out of public view (Like in private chat or something)\n\n\n5. What comes around, goes around.\n\nWell the game is about fun for sure! But to keep it realistic to a certain level then we need to take the consequenses of our actions.\nSo that would mean if you threaten, or use indecent sexual conduct, etc, to an other character then know that either the character, or the other players might do something about it.\n\nAre there consequenses for such actions in the Real world then so will there be in game.\n\nWe more then encourage evil characters though they need to face the consequences of their action.\n\nWhat goes around comes around people, or -each coin has two sides- or the \"Ying and Yang\" kinda deal and more of those thigs but just keep it real and take the consequenses like you should and we all have a nice time on the server.\n\n6. Crime & punishment.\n\nWe enforce these rules so we keep things fair and square. we will not ban you for stealing an apple or something.... though your character might get fined and a nice hotel with the delicious menu of only bread and water for a IC day orso (And no its no 3 star Hotel, its jail people!!!!!)\nAnd we won't ban you for a honest mistake. We will handle the three time rule. So first time you will get a warning and perhaps a speech from Aranna to Tokio, second time we might take a level and fine you with gold or take an item, third time, well you will get a ban from the server. Misbehaving in such a way is bad and most players dont approve it and surely the DM's wont!\n\nNOTE: Rogues can use Pickpocket on this server, a player is allowed to pickpocket an other player MITS he ask the target OOC first though (Of course the targeted player must agree to it).\n\n\n7. Problems need to be reported.\n\nProblems need to be reported as soon as possible. To a DM or even better, report it to the admin! We will try to help you with any issue you got with an other player or anything else you seem to have a problem with. Bare in mind that if you have a problem with even a DM then you should just report it to the admin. We all want to have a nice time on this server.\nSo keep us informed with your problems and we will try to help you with it.\n\nDocumentation of every kind, preferably of screenshots will be a great help in reporting and it gives us \"some\" insight of whats going on.","Content Guide":"Adult","RolePlay":"Heavy","Forums":"Link","Description":"There was once a time where Dragons ruled the sky as the humans build their cities and towns upon Eamara island.

His death fell hard on the dragons and on the humans, in his honor they erected a statue of him and planted it in the place where he loved it most.\nAs the humans and other folk stood their last stance against the army of dragons, summons and Orcs to defend their homes.\nAt the wizardtower did the armies fought as dragons flew at each others neck and the ground armies charged at each other with big weapons.\nThat day, did the war ended as almost all hope has faded did the tower crumble and collapsed as it killed the leader with it.\nAs it had cost many lives, men, elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings and dragons. Many died that day and as the few remaining returned to their homes to try and rebuild their lives. The dragons returned to their mountains to be minding their own business once more, knowing that they would face now even darker times. Dwarves returned to their mines and the elves returned to their forests, Halflings went to the hilly countries of the Island as the humans returned to their cities, yet their cities became infected by evil and they became lost to the island.\nThe dwarves hid themselves deep into the mines to be never seen again as the elves simply vanished in the woods, hidden from everyone and the halflings hid in their hilly homes to live their live.\nThe gnomes returned to their lab as they fancied crafting more then anything.\n\nAnd as the years, ages even passed did the island became forgotten by all who knew about it.\n\nEamara island, lays in the middle of the ocean, far from any kind of civilization.

The concept is quite new, here are the most important points :\n\n- the gameworld is infinite and self-generated by the system : undergrounds, interiors, exteriors, planets, star systems, galaxies, the whole universe; there is no size nor expansion limit, the number of game areas is infinite.\n\n- the website of the server acts very closely to the server itself : game maps, informations, shops, messages boards, weather, etc : everything can be consulted LIVE on the website. The game is played in NWN as well as on the website. For example, the game areas are showed on the website as they are discovered in the game. The objects sold by players can be consulted on the website, and many other examples.\n\n- a gameworld generated randomly : cities, towns, castles, ruins, animal reserves, resources mountains, amusement parks, domains, etc. are placed and configured automatically by the system. Of course, DMs and hosters can change it at any time.\n\n- players can build domains : huge political, economical and military centres with a lot of various construction possibilities, like shops, inns, extractors, farms, fields, transports, caserns, factories, etc. Players can become king of a planet by having a definite number of domains with some conditions. Kings can then rule their planet by definying laws. An empire can be created if several planets belong to a player or a player guide.\n\n- Creatures and resources are predefinied by the hosters for each planet. But then, the system places them randomly, sometimes in groups or families, with real attack and trap tactics. The world is very alive and random, there are often natural surprises.\n\n- Players can play monster races, like goblin, minotaur, troll, werewolf, etc. with boni et mali for each of them.\n\n- Players can play alone or in groups or with DMs, in role-play modus or hak n' slash or mixed, players have the choice.\n\n- And much more.\n\nCome and build your Empire, and help us to improve this module. Maybe you will also be interested in hosting your own UOA galaxy, so our universe can be built, because in NWN, the universe is now infinite.\n\nBest regards,\nTheRack.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1337":{"Title":"Bleach Revival","Author":"DM Nadir","Submitted":20100924,"Updated":20110727,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"Requires All Expansions (SoU & HotU & CEP)","Website":"Link","Number Players":"64","Setting":"Bleach manga/anime based world, built to be as true to the world as possible.","Length":"Constantly Ongoing with new updates and limitless options.","Number DMs":"7","IPs":"94.136.46.20:5122","Staff Requirements":"Agreeing to DM Code of Conduct.","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Light","Classes":"All classes available except Red Dragon Disciple and Shifter.\nAll other classes given great stat feats at epic levels.","Tricks & Traps":"Non-existent","Level Range":"1 to 40","Magic Level":"Great","Schedule":"Available, constantly improving.","Treasure":"Moderate","Number Servers":"1","DM Needed":"Multiple DMs required","Alignments":"All Available.","Races":"Human, Hollow, Shinigami, Quincy, Modified Soul, Arrancar, Vizard and Bount.","PVP":"Mixed","ApplicationReqs":"No application requirements to play.","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"Death is dependent on roleplay.","Connection":"100 Mbps","House rules":"Uses a customised Dice Fight roleplay system.","Content Guide":"Mature","Player Requirements":"CEP 2.4 only.","RolePlay":"Heavy","Description":"Bleach Revival is a detailed world, built by the players for the players, to offer them as much as possible to enrich the roleplay potential of the server.\nOffering many unique features and a dedicated DM team that are focused on fairness, and providing opportunity for roleplay and progression.","Rating":10,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"1338":{"Title":"Castle Vane","Author":"Bosgald","Submitted":20101009,"Updated":20101009,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"HOTU-1.69","Number Players":"35","Setting":"Dangerous lands surrounding a castle.","Number DMs":"2","IPs":"94.227.162.249:5121","Staff Requirements":"That you possess a good understanding of roleplay.","Scope":"Epic","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All classes are available.","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"There is no level range, but getting to level 10 will take a long time - in keeping with FR.","Magic Level":"Moderate","Schedule":"The server is expected to be fully complete by the end of October.

A detailed crafted world with unique class and race lore--negotiate with honorable orcs, explore a far wider range of possibilities as a two-god cleric, walk the path of a mage and try not to fall into corruption...\n\nPlayers begin at level one in the small town of Greycliff, perched precariously at the edge of a smuggler's cove and three competing nation-states. Unique approaches to old ideas--make a savage, maddened elven barbarian, a Wizard delving deeper into dark secrets, a cleric following their own path. Watch deserters approach friendly civilians and slaughter them for their gold, go on merchant expeditions to far-off, hostile cities for gold and glory, or put an end to war. Players are encouraged and able to affect the world as their characters see fit--and are able. \n\nFeatures:\n-Player's efforts and effects on the world and town will slowly raise the level cap, allowing for players to slowly grow more powerful based on the realistic nature of their environment.\n-Extensive crafting and fishing system. Be a farmer, baker, alchemist, and more.\n-Unique setting that paves the way for roleplay that goes beyond good and evil, deeper roleplay with hostile enemies, yet remains familiar to Forgotten Realms players.\n-Level-up system in which good roleplay, completing player quests, or affecting the world allow you to level up, so you earn your levels through more than hack'n'slash but nobody gets forgotten.\n-Conflicts within conflicts, stories within stories, background lore which will be slowly revealed.\n-Respectful, comfortable, and roleplay-oriented community.\n-Dynamic global weather and season system...the environment and weather changes as the years go by.\n-A variety of roleplay assisting systems such as letter-writing, knocking on doors, DMFI languages, and more.\n\nInterested in becoming staff or joining us?

The people there acknowledge no overlord and pay tribute to no great power, but instead jealously guard their independence and freedom from their larger neighbors.\n\nFor hundreds of years, Dalesmen have led rustic lives. Scattered in small communities, they have learned that the price of freedom is sober responsibility. People count\non no one but themselves, or perhaps the fellow who lives in the next farm over. Hard work and clean living will succeed where foreign magic and plots fail.\n\nUnfortunately, the Dalesmen have found that their simple lifestyle and morals aren't always enough. To the north lie the black battlements of Zhentil Keep, ruled by dangerous and manipulative folk who would like nothing better than to add the Dales to their list of conquests. To the south is the young nation of Sembia -- wealthy, ambitious, and strong. West of the Dales are broken mountains and badlands where all kinds of evil creatures plot raids and war against the Dales below. The freedom of the Dales often rests on the point of a sword.\n\nIn the old elven woods, the Cormanthor, ruins and old secrets lie waiting, some harboring wondrous treasures and others horrible death. The ancient woods are not so quiet or empty as the Dalesmen would like, and all sorts of brigands, bandits, and monsters have made their home in the dark forests and tors that lie between the Dales.\n\nWith the elven retreat, changes are sweeping this region, and adventure has come again to the Dales. From Scardale to Shadowdale, from Battledale to Teshendale, high peril, dark magic and ancient ruins wait for the bold of heart.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"1342":{"Title":"Las 13 Estrellas","Author":"AlexVIIIAlex","Submitted":20101120,"Updated":20101128,"Category":"Roleplay","Patch Version":"CEP-2.00 Requires Community Expansion Project","Number Players":"1-30","Number DMs":"1 (always on-line)","IPs":"79.145.180.252","Scope":"Medium","Hack & Slash":"Medium","Classes":"All the basics of nwn.","Tricks & Traps":"Medium","Level Range":"1-40 (reencarnable/To reincarnate)","Magic Level":"Low to Moderate","Schedule":"All the day.

Be a commander, direct your workers, create your legions, and attack the enemy!\n----------------------------------------\nThis is, what I would call, Strategy PvP. You start the game at level 5, and 500 gold to purchase starting equipment at the starter merchant. Then, once you enter the game, you are given aditional gold to help you start off your army. You start with a limited amount of workers, who can harvest food, mine raw materials, or increase your production level. There are multiple important units as well. The Enchanter/ess, who can craft magical items using gold, materials, and production. A mine foreman/taskmaster oversees the production of materials. He can be used to withdraw a miner from the mines, and as a formidable warrior he can also fight with the best of them. There are the merchants, who sell and buy items, and will hire out mercenries. And then, each team has a king in their stronghold, who is the objective of the game. \n\nIn other words, your king dies, YOU LOSE.

To understand what that means you first need to understand what Vives was.\n\nBilled as a \"poetic and breathing world\" by its creators, the Vives PW was a place for roleplaying and storytelling. Half the experience was in-game, the other half happened on the forum where players and dm's embroidered upon in-game action and spun new yarns. Vives was one of the first persistent worlds, beginning in 2003, and running until early 2010, when Cecil the (sea sick) server died. By this time the original team had gone on to other things, but the memories remained, and a few crazies lingered.\n\nWe are so crazy about Vives that we resurrected it six months ago, and have kept the torch lit. And now, we have renewed its look with two recent hall of fame projects, Project Q, and NWNCQ. This is our relaunch of Vives. We call it Vives Refreshed.\n\nWe get together for periodic game nights, and in between game nights players romp across the world impromptu on adventures of their own making. Vives comprises 700 areas, every one of which is significant to Vives' story and game play, has a well developed body of lore that you can discover in game, and is well loved by its builders and players. Vives is also a very dangerous world. Adventure with a friend and don't feed the undead.\n\nWe use a number of hak packs. We have links to downloads in the Files section below. In additon to these downloads you will need Project Q, and the modular version of NWNCQ. Project Q is awesome. You should download it. Check it out.\nBoth Project Q, and the NWNCQ modular hak system are listed in our required Hak Paks.\n\nOur new forum where we gather is at lefora forums.\n\nThe old vives page can be found here.\n\n* * * CONTRIBUTORS and CUSTOM CONTENT (a selection) * * *\nNWN community - neither Vives nor Vives Refreshed would exist without the broader NWN community.

Political roleplay will be a large part of the server, and various player-created factions and player-ruled factions will interact to create a living, organic world. \n\n� Large, sweeping areas to give a sense of scale \n\n� Play as anything you like - From an ambitious warlord, to a daring settler, or a glory-seeking adventurer. You choose your own ambitions, and shape the world around you. \n\n� Build into the land itself! You can cut down forests, build towers, dig into the side of cliffs, make secret hideouts. With the proper effort, anything can be done. \n\n� Dynamic in-character consequence system. Great deeds of bravery or nefarious evil will be rewarded. But remember, you must pay for the consequences of your actions. Permanent death is an extremely important part of narrative, and will be a part of the roleplay here. \n\n� Our philosophy towards DMing: Favoritism is anathema, DMs exist to serve player arcs and support player storylines. Rather than being rule-enforcers, they are 99% focused on interactive narrative. Player factions will be a key source of roleplay and gameplay, and DMs will do their utmost to support their growth and existence. \n\n� Influences from real-world history, high fantasy, and various low-fantasy settings such as A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE \n\n� A unique adaptation of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting: Magic and the gods are mysterious, and the world is gritty and organic.

Now we stand upon the border of our Empire, the newest edge of our Civilization. Hadrian. We will make it our own.\"\n- Author Unknown, Attributed to An Imperial Officer At the Founding of Hadrian\n\n\nWelcome to Netheril Rising, a Neverwinter Nights 1 persistent roleplaying server set in the Forgotten Realms. The setting is focused on the ancient past of the Forgotten Realms, specifically the early history of the Netheril Empire. The main settlement of the server is the town of Hadrian; a border town recently settled by the Netherese on the very edge of the expanding Netheril Empire. Though the Netheril Empire is powerful, it is still in it's infancy and far from the Arcane power of Forgotten Realm lore.\n\nThe lands around Hadrian are harsh and the town faces many challenges as it attempts to establish itself in virgin wilderness. These virgin lands are said to be filled with vicious animals, bands of goblins, orcs, and even savage humanoids that refuse to accept a civilized life style. There are also rumors of a great tribe of goblins that still survives just beyond the border of the lands' claimed by the Empire with the establishment of Hadrian.\n\nThe town of Hadrian is not without resource, however. It has an established Militia, headed by officers of the Imperial Army. Representatives from each of the three most influential Imperial Houses. A member of the Enclave, the Arcanists Guild of the Netheril Empire. Even an Oracle of Janath is said to call the lands around Hadrian home. \n\nWhile Hadrian may prosper for the moment, it's future is in the hands of the colonists whom are arriving daily. Drawn from throughout the Empire, they come for many reasons. A new start, a chance to prove themselves, or fortune and glory perhaps.

He led a strong and vibrant community which built the foundation of Aventia until he stopped hosting in 2008 (?) After which Ralt began hosting it, and in conjunction with the community continued to develop until he stopped hosting about 5-6 months ago. I considered this the second generation of Av (Av2.) There are now 2 separate Aventias, AventiaG hosted by Grench, and Aventia 3 Merged hosted by myself. Aventia originally was all one module, but was then split up into 4 (and then later 5) separate modules on 4 (5) different servers sharing a server vault. I have merged them back into one module again for Av3. Aventia has had easily 100+ people work on it over the years, and Av3 continues to be community content contributed driven world with 100�s of areas for all level ranges, and constantly evolving areas and features.\n \nSome of the features of Av3 are:\n \n-Basically unlimited levels- You stop getting standard levels at 40, but continue to get levels based off XP which give you various bonuses depending on your build, in addition to a new feature in Av3 called Post Epic Level (PEL) ability bonuses which allow players to continue to gain ability points. There is an actual level cap of 2000 or so, but no one has ever legitimately (with out being a DM test toon) gotten close, so for all intensive purposes it is basically unlimited. I believe the highest level a player has achieved to date is 600, although we have other current players who are also quite high.\n \n-There are so many other features to Av3, I can�t possibly list them all, but some of them include numerous class/ability/feat/spell changes, a subrace system, an experience/gold bank in addition to an item vault, quest items can be acquired by participating in DM events but can also be gotten in game outside of events, custom items can be made, there is a re-leveler, low level forge, appearance crafter (tailor), portal system, shard of returning, a guide book to Aventia 3, and I could go on and on. \n\nSoU, HotU, and CEP 2.3 or higher required.

In a cataclysmic event it vanished from it's existence there.

A self contained pocket dimension that hangs suspended in the deep ethereal plane.\nIn Manual of the Planes terms, The Dark Isles is a demiplane on the Deep Ethereal (as presented as an option on pg. 55 of MotP). The Deep Ethereal is a transitive plane connecting the Ethereal Planes of the multiverse. Essentially it is tucked away in a dark and unremarkable corner of the universe where no one can see it.\nIn the ending days before the land collapsed many sought to flee from the chaos. Many left even as many were abandoned to the fate of the land. Those who escaped though did so unaware that their souls were still bound to the land. It was not long before the ethereal rift claimed the land and surrounding islands.\nFor many years all who were of the land slept dead and dreaming unaware that they did so, unaware that the land was destroyed and reformed.\n\n\nHaks are below you also need cep 2.3.\nLink to CEP_23_Full_C.7z below\nCheck out our forum for more info.\n\nHaks are now also available for download from or new website!

However, in this module, we have modified the setting to better fit our vision.

ALL people have the capability of terrible �evil� or generous �good.� In this setting, PURE GOOD and PURE EVIL do not exist in the mortal races. Rather, everyone is generally somewhere upon a vast spectrum, and never permanently. �Good� men can fall to temptation, just as �evil� can be redeemed. ","Experience Rewards":"Dependant on Player's efforts","Races":"It is possible to play all races in BK, including most subraces and even one or two monstrous humanoid races.\n\nSetting-wise, many races inhabit the Border Kingdoms. A variety of humanoid species exist and are generally acknowledged, and viewed as a natural part of the world.\n\nBy far, the most common species to inhabit the Border Kingdoms are Humans. Over 70% of the population is human, and most kingdoms are run, ruled, and populated by humans. Of these, the most common racial groups are Chondathans, Calishites, and Damarans. Some dwarves live in the human cities, but are generally not organized into any towns. They claim they once had a vast mountain city in the region, but it was lost centuries ago.\n\nElves are relatively uncommon, and not well-understood by the local humans. In our setting, the Drow still hold their vast underground empire, broken up into various houses. However, humans in the Border Kingdoms would mistake them for Moon Elves and would think nothing of their appearance. In this setting, the nature of the Drow is unknown to surfacers.\n\nSatyrs, centaurs, wemics, orcs, lizardfolk, and many other humanoid �intelligent� species exist, and are quite common in the more wild areas of the Border Kingdoms. While humans tend to view them warily, they are generally tolerated in small numbers. For example, the Lizardfolk of the Qurth Forest occasionally emerge to trade their furs and spices to the human settlements in exchange for metal tools. The orcish tribes once spread across the region, but have slowly been pushed into the fringes of the realm, making their homes in the hills.\n\nThere are a variety of beasts that inhabit the Border Kingdoms, but most are considered �animals.� These span from simple birds and deer, to very dangerous creatures like Owlbears or Manticores.\n\n�Unnatural� creatures exist as well, but are considered myth and legend by the vast majority of the population. Tales of the undead, for example, are considered myths and tales to scare small children. Encounters with these monsters are very, very rare. Telling tale of an encounter with a creature of undeath would likely earn the storyteller looks of disbelief, scoffs, or claims of insanity. ","PVP":"Full PvP","Vault Type":"Server","Death":"When you are killed by a static-content NPC (ie, a bear, a monster in a dungeon, etc) you are considered 'unconscious.' All of your inventory and equipment is dropped into a bag, save for the armor you currently have equipped. No XP or renown is lost.\n\nYou may then choose to:\n\na. Respawn where you were 'killed,'\n\nor\n\nb. Respawn at the last place you rested.\n\n\nWhen you are killed by a player, one of two things happen.\n\na. If the player was in 'subdual' mode, you are knocked unconscious for a little while, and your vision goes dark. Your inventory and gold is dropped.\n\nb. If the player was in 'lethal' mode, you are killed, and your character is considered permanently dead. A corpse is spawned with all your equipment inside it, which is fully lootable. Deaths this way require a screenshot of events to be taken preemptively (in case an OOC dispute arises), and a strong in-character motivation. ","Connection":"Mixed","House rules":"Yes, and they can all be found on the BK forums.","Content Guide":"Everyone","Player Requirements":"Follow the rules and understand that we are still in beta.","RolePlay":"Heavy","Forums":"Link","Description":"The Border Kingdoms is a unique, upcoming persistent world for NWN, set in the eponymous Border Kingdoms region of a slightly modified Forgotten Realms setting.\n\nSome of the features include:\n\n� Philosophy towards player dynamics and interaction with the world, a system that allows player groups to form real kingdoms with subservient NPCs to act as 'extras' rather than overshadowing PCs, which are the real focus. Political roleplay will be a large part of the server, and various player-created factions and player-ruled factions will interact to create a living, organic world.\n\n� Large, sweeping areas to give a sense of scale, and more than enough land to go around.\n\n� Play as anything you like - From an ambitious warlord, to a daring settler, or a glory-seeking adventurer. You choose your own ambitions, and shape the world around you.\n\n� Build into the land itself! You can cut down forests, build towers and castles, dig into the side of cliffs, make secret hideouts. Found a town and construct buildings to create a thriving settlement. With the proper effort, anything can be done.\n\n� Dynamic in-character consequence system. Great deeds of bravery or nefarious evil will be rewarded. But remember, you must pay for the consequences of your actions.\n\n� Our philosophy towards DMing: Favoritism is anathema, DMs exist to serve player arcs and support player storylines. Rather than being rule-enforcers, they are 99% focused on interactive narrative. Player factions will be a key source of roleplay and gameplay, and DMs will do their utmost to support their growth and existence.\n\n� Influences from real-world history, high fantasy, and various low-fantasy settings such as 'Warhammer' and 'A song of Ice and Fire.'\n\n� A unique adaptation of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting: Magic is considered the stuff of myth and legend, the gods are mysterious, and the world is gritty and organic. A significant 'darkening' of the setting.\n\n� 'Spellcaster' classes will be a very rare sight through the application cap (a la 'Jedi from S.W.G.), as will 'magical' items and 'consumables'. With this in mind, the server will be balanced to support the martial classes such as Archers, Rogues, Fighters, Barbarians, Monks, et cetera, with a strong focus on these classes. The majority of spells require expensive components to cast, and significant changes have been made to spellcasters to keep them in-line with the martial classes.\n\n�Crafted equipment will be a large part of the economy. Smiths can specialize in armor or weapons (Or both, should they spend the time and money.) All crafted equipment is, in general, superior to drops in dungeons, but takes time to make. There are a number of exceptions to this rule, but we wanted to avoid rewarding 'dungeon farming' over a crafting economy.\nHigh-quality sets of armor, for example, will specialize in different types of damage immunities. For example, a 'Reinforced'-style Full-plate will give a % immunity against piercing weapons, whereas a 'Mail-backed'-style plate will give protection against slashing. Other styles will protect against bludgeoning, et cetera. As each damage type on our weapons have been balanced to be powerful, this adds another layer of strategy to weapon and armor choice.\n\n�A number of martial and exotic weapons have been balanced to be viable in combat.\n\n� A large, carefully chosen soundtrack, entirely sourced from renaissance and medieval music from a variety of cultures around the world.\n\n� A focus on regional culture. While traveling across our many vast, carefully-crafted areas, players will experience significant cultural changes and really feel that they are in a different part of the realm.\n\n� State-of-the-art Hakpaks and the freshest, newest content from the vault, making for a visually enticing server, paired with an extremely high standard for area design and overall consistency with regards to geography.
