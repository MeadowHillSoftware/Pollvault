However, MotB and SoZ use the same name for the heartbeat script and will, therefore, require the player to rename the appropriate file for each game. \n\nI have left the SoZ heartbeat script as the default used - and so to change this to be used with MotB, the player must rename the k_mod_hb.NCS and k_mod_hb.NSS (inside my hak folder) to something like k_mod_hb.NCS_soz and k_mod_hb.NSS_soz and then rename the k_mod_hb.NCS_motb and k_mod_hb.NSS_motb to k_mod_hb.NCS and k_mod_hb.NSS.

Meaning that while you'll still have the feats and the level-draining creature weapon, all the abilities and bonuses gained from being a vampire will have vanished.\n\nThis is a workaround for that 'problem' that also restores limited functionality to the Vampire Ability feats by giving them 'new' scripts that are somewhat similar to their old abilities (Dominate Monster, Polymorph Dire Wolf, Summon Dire Wolf, and Ethereal Jaunt) and are cast at the player's total level.\n\nMake no mistake; this can not be considered anything other than a cheat.\n\nAll I did was add a new 'Vampire' class which is a duplicate of the Undead class with the two exceptions being that it:\n\nA) Requires the player to have the Mark of the Vampire feat.\nB) Adds most of the previously script-added vampiric bonus as existing feats at first level.\n\nThe feats it adds are as follows:\n\nFEAT_EPIC_GREAT_STRENGTH_1 through FEAT_EPIC_GREAT_STRENGTH_6\nFEAT_EPIC_GREAT_DEXTERITY_1 through FEAT_EPIC_GREAT_DEXTERITY_4\nFEAT_EPIC_GREAT_INTELLIGENCE_1\nFEAT_EPIC_GREAT_INTELLIGENCE_2\nFEAT_EPIC_GREAT_WISDOM_1\nFEAT_EPIC_GREAT_WISDOM_2\nFEAT_EPIC_GREAT_CHARISMA_1 through FEAT_EPIC_GREAT_CHARISMA_4\nFEAT_EPIC_ENERGY_RESISTANCE_COLD_1\nFEAT_EPIC_ENERGY_RESISTANCE_ELECTRICAL_1\nFEAT_DEATHLESS_MASTERY\nFEAT_TOUGH_AS_BONE\nFEAT_BONE_SKIN_2\nFEAT_FAST_HEALING_II\nFEAT_FAVORED_SOUL_DR_SILVER\nWeapProfCreature\nFEAT_DODGE\nFEAT_ALERTNESS\nFEAT_LIGHTNING_REFLEXES\nFEAT_IMPROVED_INITIATIVE\nFEAT_STEALTHY\nFEAT_PARTIAL_SKILL_AFFINITY_LISTEN\nFEAT_PARTIAL_SKILL_AFFINITY_SEARCH\nFEAT_PARTIAL_SKILL_AFFINITY_SPOT\nFEAT_SKILL_AFFINITY_BLUFF\nFEAT_SKILL_AFFINITY_LISTEN\nFEAT_SKILL_AFFINITY_MOVE_SILENTLY\nFEAT_SKILL_AFFINITY_SEARCH\nFEAT_SKILL_AFFINITY_SPOT\nFEAT_GREATER_SKILL_AFFINITY_MOVE_SILENTLY\nFEAT_SKILL_FOCUS_BLUFF\nFEAT_SKILL_FOCUS_HIDE\nFEAT_SKILL_FOCUS_LISTEN\nFEAT_SKILL_FOCUS_SEARCH\nFEAT_SKILL_FOCUS_SPOT\n \nThat was the closest I could get to the default bonuses with the existing Feats, and I have no clue how to go about creating new ones. If someone else wants to; feel free.\n\nAs I said earlier; taking a level of this class is obviously a cheat, and a rather messy one at that, but it might be fun to run around MotB as a partial vampire.\n\n------------------\nInstallation\n------------------\n\nJust toss in your override folder, overwriting the three 2da files included with Kaedrin's PRC Pack.\n\nThis requires both Kaedrin's PRC Pack and the Mysteries of Westgate Adventure Pack.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"33":{"Name":"Increased SoZ Creature Part Drops","Author":"Jake Zahn","Submitted":20090603,"Updated":20090604,"Category":"Module Specific","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This Mod increases the frequency of Creature Part drops in the Storm of Zehir campaign.\n\nBy default, most Samarach creatures only have a 25% to drop their relevant part while almost all Swordcoast creatures have a 100% chance.
