This is the same tool that has been \n\nused by Obsidian game designers to create the official NWN2 campaign.\n\nThis brief guide will help you get started by demonstrating the basics of \n\nthe toolset. You will learn fastest by experimenting with the toolset and by \n\njoining the NWN2 mod community, which can be reached through \n\nwww.obsidianent.com (click on NWN2 logo).\n\nNote: This version of the toolset documentation has been assembled for \n\nthe purpose of the toolset beta test. We recognize that this documentation is \n\nnot as thorough as desired and appreciate your patience and understanding in \n\ntesting the toolset with only this limited documentation to assist you. In \n\naddition to your comments on the toolset itself, we would appreciate your \n\nfeedback on what additional documentation is most needed to help both new \n\nand experienced modders create their own NWN2 worlds.\nThe exclusive NWN2 Toolset Beta Test forum can be found at \n\nwww.ataricommunity.com. Please look there for more information on this Beta \n\nTest.\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe NWN2 toolset package includes the following elements:\n\n\nThe NWN2 game and toolset.\n NWN2_BetaTest_Toolset_HowTos: A series of HowTos to explain basic \n\ntoolset use. These HowTos include the following topics:\nCreating a Module: The three components that comprise a module: areas, \n\nconversations, scripts. Create a new area, including placing a start location and \n\ntrying it out in the game.\nPlacing Content: Place and set-up creatures, placeables (props), and \n\nloot.\nWriting a Conversation: Create a dialogue and attach it to an NPC. Simple \n\nuse of scripts in conversations.\nBasic Trigger Usage: Place a trigger and use it to cause something to \n\nhappen.\nCreate items: Create your own magic items for players to find (and \n\nenemies to use!) Use armor attachments and coloring to create unique armor \n\nappearances.\nMap Making: Create and sculpt an exterior or interior area. Understanding \n\nhow to create maps isn�t necessary to get started, but that will help you create \n\nyour own world with its own unique flavor.\nNWN2_BetaTest_Toolset_Scripting: This document is primarily intended \n\nfor advanced users and includes:\nAn explanation of NWN2 global script naming conventions.\nA library of over 50 available action and conditional scripts (for use in \n\nconversations).\nDescriptions of new and modified scripts (as compared to those in \n\nNWN1), including new scripting systems (ambient life and scripted \n\nwaypoints).\nNWN2_BetaTest_Toolset_FAQ: A short collection of some specific \n\nquestions that have come up during our development of NWN2.\nSample Module: A sample module, 0100_UninvitedGuests. This module \n\nis an extremely simple adventure that makes use of many of the concepts \n\ndiscussed in the HowTos. It is designed to be easy for you view examples of \n\nhow to accomplish certain tasks.\nStarter Maps: Six �blank� maps that are fully sculpted but contain no \n\ncontent (monsters, NPCs, etc.). You can use these to quickly set-up your own \n\nquests and adventures!\n\n\nWHAT�S NEW?\n\nIf you are experienced with the Aurora engine and NWN1 toolset, then you will \n\nfind many familiar features in the NWN2 toolset. The toolset you have now has \n\nbeen redesigned, however, to make the most of new features and technology \n\nthat is available for NWN2. Some of the new features include:\n\nWorld Creation\n\nTerrain Painting. You can sculpt the terrain and apply textures, water, \n\nand animated grass. Various brush sizes are available for initial \n\nsculpting/painting and refined work.\nTrees. You can quickly generate unique and animated trees.\nWeather Control. You can set sky color and cloud density and \n\nvelocity.\nDynamic Day/Night Cycle. You can set various weather and lighting \n\nconditions and the game will dynamically move between them as time \n\nprogresses. For example, you can have a light fog roll in during the dawn and \n\nthen burn away as the sun rises.\nSpecial Effects Editor. The toolset comes with the special effects editor \n\nthat was used for the NWN2 spells.\nArmor Customization. With over 100 different greaves, vambraces, and \n\nmore, you can custom tailor armors to create your own unique-looking magic \n\nitems or uniforms. All armor pieces can be individually tinted with multiple \n\ncolors.\nObject Scaling. You can scale most placeables and creatures easily, \n\nallowing you to make a tougher looking bugbear chieftain or a cat-sized giant \n\nspider hatchling.\nEnhanced Camera Controls. New camera features allow for more \n\ncinematic cut scenes.\nGlobal Scripts. The NWN2 toolset has a much more robust collection of \n\nglobal scripts that are ready for use in your own modules.\n\nUsability\n\nCustomizable Workspace. You have much more control over where \n\nvarious tools and windows are located and how much space they take up, \n\nallowing you to adjust the toolset�s layout as you wish.\nImproved Conversation Editor. You can pass parameters to scripts and \n\nassign multiple conditional and action scripts. A �main question node� feature \n\nmakes it much easier to construct certain types of conversations.\nLevel Baking. A semi-automated baking process creates the walkmesh for \n\nyour level, which causes placeables you specify to automatically block \n\nmovement without dealing directly with the walkmesh.\nMulti-tasking. You can have multiple areas, conversations, and scripts \n\nopen simultaneously, allowing for faster content creation.\nCampaign System. Multiple modules can now share resources and journal \n\ndata.\nFlexible Categories. NWN2 has no item palettes, allowing you to organize \n\nyour blueprints and instances in whatever categories you�d like.\nPlugins. You can create plugins for the toolset, much like you can for \n\nPhotoshop or 3DS Max.\n\n\nQUICK REFERENCE\n\nTo use the toolset, just open the file NWN2ToolsetLauncher.exe. After a few \n\nmoments, you should see:\n\nAll windows within the NWN2 Toolset can be docked, resized, and moved to \n\nset things up however you prefer. The main components of the toolset \n\nare:\n\nMenu Bar.\nToolbars.\nArea List/Conversation List/Script List. Tabs at the bottom select which \n\nlist you are viewing. Double-click on any area, conversation, or script name in \n\nthe list to open it.\nArea Contents. Lists all of the components of the currently selected area, \n\nif any. Components include items, creatures, triggers, placeables, and \n\nmore.\nArea Viewer. Shows what the area looks like. You can modify terrain and \n\ntextures, place objects, etc. through the Area Viewer.\nProperty Panel. Shows properties for the selected object. The Property \n\nPanel contains many tabs (Basics tab, Skills tab, etc.). If you select an object in \n\nthe Area Viewer (5), Area Contents (4), or Specific Blueprints (8) section, its \n\nproperties are shown here.\nBlueprint categories. Blueprints are templates for any object that can be \n\nplaced in an area. Note that the Area Contents section (4) has the same \n\noptions. Blueprints include all global content as well as local templates you \n\nmight create.\n\nNote: If you click on a blueprint, its properties automatically appear \n\nin the Property Panel. You can right-click on a blueprint to see its properties in \n\na new window, but this process can be slow and no more than 3 property \n\nwindows can be open at any time.\n\n\nSpecific Blueprints. This section is similar to the Area Contents, but lists \n\nall available objects, not just those placed in the current area. For example, this \n\nsection would let you select a goblin, while the Area Contents section lets you \n\nselect a specific goblin that you have placed.\nTabs to switch from Blueprints to the Terrain (exteriors) and Tile \n\n(interiors) tabs.\n\nThe HowTos provide additional detail about many of these features. Open the \n\nSample Module to reverse engineer our content and learn more about the \n\ntoolset�s functionality.\nTo try the Sample Module, start NWN2, click �New Game,� then �New Module,� \n\nand select 0100_UninvitedGuests.\n\nTo open the Sample Module in the toolset, start the toolset, then File \n\n Open, and select 0100_UninvitedGuests.mod.\n\nSome simple tips:\n\nIf you get stuck, please visit www.ataricommunity.com and post on the \n\nforums.\nIn the Area Viewer, use Ctrl-middle-click to rotate the camera and the \n\nmousewheel to move the camera forward and backwards.\nFor fast creation of objects (creatures, items, placeables � anything in the \n\nBlueprint Categories section) copy the blueprint of an existing object that�s \n\nsimilar to what you want. Then change the properties of the copied \n\nblueprint.\nYou can use Copy (Ctrl-C) and Paste (Ctrl-V) in the Area Viewer to \n\nquickly duplicate placed objects.\nCheck View  Options and the Plugins menu to change settings \n\nand to access helpful supplemental tools.\n\nWe hope you enjoy all of the features of the NWN2 toolset. We appreciate \n\nyour time and interest and look forward to your comments and \n\nsuggestions!\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe NWN2 Team\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"4":{"Name":"NWN2 TOOLSET HOWTO - CREATING A MODULE","Author":"Obsidian","Submitted":20061003,"Updated":20061003,"Category":"Toolset","Description":"NWN2 TOOLSET HOWTO - CREATING A MODULE\n\n\nThis HowTo covers creating a module and areas within that module, as well as \n\nthe basic components of a module: Areas, Conversations, and Scripts. By the \n\nend of this HowTo you�ll be familiar with the anatomy of a module and know \n\nhow to create a new area, install a starting point, and try it out in the game.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWhat is a Module?\nLoading a Module\nAreas, Conversations, and Scripts\nMaking Your First Area\nPlacing a Start Location\nExploring Your Module\nConclusion\n\n\nWHAT IS A MODULE?\n\nModules (.mod files) contain all the elements of a complete Neverwinter Nights \n\n2 adventure. A module with one area is the most basic playable adventure, \n\nwith a typical short adventure being a module of several areas and events. A \n\ntruly epic adventure (such as the official NWN2 campaign) links several \n\nmodules together.\n\nTo create a new module, simply open the toolset. When it first loads it should \n\nlook like the screen below. A new, empty module is now ready to be made.\n\n\n\nLOADING A MODULE\n\nShould you wish to continue working on an existing module, you can open \n\nyour saved module through the Dropdown Menu: File  Open.\n\nThis Open function brings up a window where you can browse your computer \n\nfor the module. The default directory is the Modules directory in your \n\nNeverwinter Nights 2 game folder. Files with a .mod extension are valid \n\nmodule files.\n\n\nAREAS, CONVERSATIONS, AND SCRIPTS\n\nThe three main components of a module are Areas, Conversations, and \n\nScripts.\n\nAreas are the playable levels of the module. A playable module needs at least \n\none area, and multiple areas can be packaged into one module. Areas contain \n\na walkable region populated with creatures, placeables (the NWN2 term for \n\nstationary objects), and a host of other gameplay objects. An area could be a \n\ntavern, a cave, a forest of goblins, a farm, or whatever your imagination would \n\nlike. It�s important to note that an entire area loads all at once and moving \n\nbetween areas requires a load. If an area is too large, loading it may take \n\nforever and the area might run more slowly during play. Conversely, many \n\nsmall areas mean frequent trips to the loading screen. For your first areas, you \n\nshould err on the side of making them small.\n\nAreas can either be exterior or interior � it is not possible to have an area \n\nflagged as both, though you can have an exterior area (a town) that contains \n\nseveral doors in to interior areas (the shops and houses of the town).\nConversations are interactions that are created with the Dialogue Editor. They \n\ncontain the text and special conditions of a speech, debate, staredown, or any \n\nother talking event in the adventure. Conversations are used whenever you�d \n\nlike to give players a means for talking to someone.\n\nAt its heart, a conversation is any sort of branching menu, so a \n\nconversation doesn�t necessarily have to be two people talking � if you want a \n\nplayer to encounter a panel with three switches, a conversation with three \n\nresponses is an effective way to present the player with the situation.\n\nConversations are extremely powerful tools and are covered in later \n\nHowTos. For now, just remember that conversations are saved in a module, so \n\nany conversation can be used across all areas packaged into one module.\n\nScripts are text files containing lines of code (written in the game�s \n\nC-based programming language) that choreograph special actions and events \n\nabove and beyond the game�s regular set of actions. A troll placed in a cave \n\nknows how to attack adventurers without you giving it any pointers or \n\ninstructions. If you want the troll to always run away from dwarves, or if you�d \n\nlike reinforcements to appear when it dies, scripts can let you make those \n\nthings happen.\n\nWith scripting, nearly any sort of custom event, behavior, or cut scene can \n\nbe crafted by a dedicated designer. However, scripting is a pretty advanced \n\ntopic so for now just know that custom scripts are saved as part of a module, \n\nand can thus be used across all areas packaged into one module.\n\n\nMAKING YOUR FIRST AREA\n\nA module needs at least one area to be playable. To create your first area, use \n\nthe Dropdown Menus and select File  New  Area.\n\nOnce you�ve selected to create a new area from the dropdown menu, the New \n\nArea Wizard window appears. Enter a name for your area as the area�s tag (in \n\nthe above example, the new area will be the area outside of Pitney Lannon�s \n\nhouse so the name �Lannon House Exterior� is used).\n\nTags are used by the toolset and game to identify many different types of \n\nthings, from areas to creatures to items. Tags do not need to be unique.\n\nNext, select type of area you wish to make (to continue the above \n\nexample, this will be Pitney�s property, not the inside of his house, so we�ll \n\nchoose exterior). Press �Next� when you�ve entered the area tag and selected \n\nthe desired area type. These cannot be changed once the area is created.\n\nNow the New Area Wizard asks for your desired area size. You can either \n\nselect a pre-defined square sized from Tiny (about the size of a small home or \n\ngarden) to Giant (a sprawling city or expansive forest) or you can create a \n\nrectangle of varying length and width by adjusting the sliders. Press the \n\n�Finish� button when you have the desired size. We�ll keep it simple for this \n\nexample and stick with a small area.\n\nOnce you�ve selected the area size, you�ve made a new area! You will see a \n\nblank area in your toolset!\n\n\nPLACING A START LOCATION\n\nWith an area in play, all you need is a start location and your module will be \n\nplayable (albeit slightly lacking in epic content). The start location lets the \n\ngame know where to place the player characters when they enter the module. \n\nMultiple areas can be included in a module, the Start Location can be in any \n\none of those areas (not necessarily the first one you made). There can only be \n\none Start Location per module, so if one is already present in any area, placing \n\na new Start Location erases the old one.\n\nTo place a start location, click on the �Set Start Location� text on the action \n\nbar running across the top of the screen. It�s next to a red circle with an arrow \n\nin it, so it should stand out from the other buttons. Once you�ve clicked it, you \n\ncan now click anywhere in the terrain to place the Start Location. When placed, \n\nit appears as a red compass.\n\n\nEXPLORING YOUR MODULE\n\nWhile it may not look like much, an area with a start location is all you need to \n\nhave a playable adventure. If you�d like to explore the area you�ve made, you�ll \n\nneed to save your module and then load the game and play your module as if \n\nit were any other adventure.\n\nTo save your module, simply save from the Dropdown Menu: File \n\n Save As. Alternately, Ctrl+S also saves. Give your module a name \n\nand click �Save� and you�re ready to go!\nStart by launching your Neverwinter Nights 2 client.\n\nSelect a �New Game� followed by �New Module.� Look at the list of \n\nmodules and you should see yours. Select it from the list and press �Start \n\nModule.� Select a character (or make one if you wish) and you�re ready to walk \n\naround your level!\n\n\nHey� that blank exterior sure looks familiar�\nAs you build your module, you can give your adventure a practice test by \n\nplacing the start location near an area of interest, saving your game, playing \n\nthe module in the game, and seeing what happens!\n\nOne thing to keep in mind if you are going to test out your level in the \n\ngame: save games include module information. So if you save your game \n\nwhile playing your module, changing the module won�t have an effect on your \n\nsave game. To get a sense of the latest changes to your module, you should \n\nfire it up as a new module instead of loading a save game.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThat concludes the basic info on getting your module started. You�re well on \n\nyour way to creating your own single-session adventures or epic sagas. Now \n\nthat you�ve completed this HowTo, you should know:\n\n How to create a new module (it�s as simple as opening the toolset).\nThe general purposes of areas, conversations, and scripts.\nHow to create a new area.\nHow to place a Start Location.\nHow to save your module and test it out in the game.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"5":{"Name":"NWN2 TOOLSET HOWTO � PLACING OBJECTS","Author":"Obsidian","Submitted":20061003,"Updated":20061003,"Category":"Toolset","Description":"NWN2 TOOLSET HOWTO � PLACING OBJECTS\n\n\nThis HowTo will teach you the basics of placing creatures, placeables, and \n\nitems into the areas of your module. In addition to basic placement, you�ll \n\nexplore some basic settings to modify the actors and props of your world \n\nwithout complicated scripting. By the end of the HowTo, you will know how to \n\npopulate your area with allies, villains, scenery, and loot.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWhat Are Objects?\nBlueprints and Instances\nCreatures\nPlacing Creatures\nModifying Creatures\nFactions\nDungeons & Dragons Statistics\nConversations\nScripts\nPlaceables\nPlacing Placeables\nModifying Placeables\nItems\nPlacing Items on Creatures and Placeables\nConclusion\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE OBJECTS?\n\n\nAn object is something that can be placed in your module. The most common \n\nobjects you�ll probably use are creatures, placeables, and items, which are the \n\nmeat and potatoes of fantasy adventure. These are the actors and props that \n\nwill populate your areas with challenge and flavor.\n\nScripts and conversations interact with these elements to make epic quests \n\nand branching puzzles� but all that will come later � you can still make a \n\nsimple adventure from just these easy-to-place and easy-to-tweak game \n\nobjects.\n\nCreatures are monsters, villagers, beasts, ghosts, rival adventurers, and \n\nany manner of non-player characters (NPCs) in the game (and they can even \n\nbe made into companions that the player could control, though for now, it�s \n\nbest to just view them as always computer-controlled).\n\nCreatures can engage in combat and conversations, move around the \n\ngame world, use doors and other objects, cast spells and invoke special \n\nabilities, and perform complex behaviors through the use of scripting.\n\nPlaceables are the name for props and environmental objects in \n\nNeverwinter Nights 2. Like creatures, placeables can have scripts, inventories, \n\nand conversations, though they lack any sort of behavior.\nItems are the weapons, armor, potions, keys, quest objects, and other portable \n\nprops of the game. Items are rarely placed directly into the game world the \n\nsame way as creatures and placeables. Instead, items are usually attached to \n\ncreatures and placeables.\n\n\nBLUEPRINTS AND INSTANCES\n\nCreatures, Placeables, and Items are created as blueprints � a sort of template \n\nor mold from which identical copies can be sewn (all objects have blueprints). \n\nOnce a creature, placeable, or item is placed into a level from a blueprint, that \n\nunique actor or prop becomes an instance.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Instances\n\nChanges to one instance have no effect on the blueprint or another instance \n\nthat came from the same blueprint. Furthermore, an instance is not affected by \n\nchanges to its parent blueprint after it is placed.\n\nIf you place down five goblins from the same blueprint and make one a \n\nwizard, the other four do not automatically change to wizards as well. If you \n\nplace down five goblins of the same blueprint and then add armor to the \n\nblueprint, the five instances of goblins placed would not automatically gain \n\narmor (though any placed down after the blueprint changed would be \n\narmored).\n\nThe creatures, placeables, and items discussed in this HowTo are already \n\nin the Toolset. Another HowTo discusses how to create your own items and a \n\nsimilar procedure applies to creating new creature or placeable blueprints.\n\n\nCREATURES\n\nWhile the name �creature� may evoke images monsters and vermin, this \n\ngeneric term applies to all mobile actors in the game, even kind old ladies and \n\nchildren who need to be rescued from wolves. Creatures fill a wide variety of \n\nroles: monsters, conversation encounters, merchants, and background traffic \n\nare the most common.\n\n\nPlacing Creatures\n\nCreatures can be placed into the level with the toolset. To do this, locate the \n\n�Blueprints� window in your Toolset. In the default setup, you�ll see this \n\nwindow in the lower-right corner. Press the �Creatures� button (the dragon \n\nsymbol) to view all creature blueprints. You�ll see several entries with a �+� \n\nsign next to the name, click the �+� to expand the list.\n\nLook for Humanoid  Lizardfolk  Lizardfolk Warrior\nClick on the Lizardfolk Warrior entry and you will now be able to place \n\nLizardfolk Warriors. Move your cursor into the Area Viewer and click on the \n\nmap wherever you�d like to place an instance of the Lizardfolk Warrior.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Spawning and Encounters\n\nCreatures can also be spawned in. In this case, you don�t actually �paint� the \n\ncreature into the level in the Toolset. Instead, scripts are used to create, in \n\nreal-time, X number of instances of Y blueprint. In this way, you could create a \n\nscenario where enemies flood in through a trapdoor but only when a certain \n\ncondition has been met (an alarm raised, for instance).\n\nThe enemies aren�t actually in the level until the script calls them in, so a \n\ncrafty player can�t detect them or interact with them until certain conditions \n\nhave been met. A more automated method of spawning in creatures is through \n\nencounters.\n\nSpawning in creatures is an advanced technique that won�t be covered in \n\nthis HowTo, but it�s important to know that placing creatures directly into the \n\nlevel is not the only method for populating your module. When you are more \n\ncomfortable with the toolset, you should experiment with encounter blueprints.\n\nOnce placed in the level, you can freely change a creature�s properties. \n\nPress the �Select Objects� button on the Toolbar at the top of the toolset to \n\nmake sure your cursor is in selection mode. Click on the creature in the Area \n\nViewer to select it and look at the Property Panel (located in the upper-right \n\ncorner of the screen by default).\n\n\nModifying Creatures\n\nYou can alter a creature�s appearance in many ways. The �Properties� tab has \n\nentries for overall appearance type, hair, head, body bag, options to make \n\nhelmets or armor invisible on a creature, and many other such features.\n\nLet�s try experimenting with a creature�s scale and color.\nFind the entry for �Scale� and click on the text field to the right that currently \n\nhas �1, 1, 1� in it. When you click on this field, you�ll see a flashing cursor \n\nprompting you to input new values for the creature�s scale. This scale of this \n\ncreature is currently 1 x width, 1 x length, and 1 x height. Try typing in �1.5, \n\n1.5, 1.5� Press Enter when done and watch as your Lizardfolk Warrior \n\nincreases 50% in every dimension.\n\nTo change the color, scroll down to the properties below scale and look \n\nfor �Tint (Skin).� Click on the adjacent field (which should show a white box \n\nand the numbers �255, 255, 255�). Clicking will bring up a color selection tool. \n\nTry picking some colors and note that creature�s appearance in your editing \n\nwindow. When you�ve found a color you like, click �OK� to set that color for the \n\nLizardfolk Warrior.\n\n\nFactions\n\nFaction is an important property for creatures as it determines who a creature \n\nlikes and dislikes. A creature is friendly with creatures of its own faction and \n\nneutral or hostile to creatures of other factions. To set a faction, just click on \n\nthe �Faction� field (scroll down, it�s below the fields for scale and tint and under \n\nthe �Behavior� subset of properties) and click on the info field. You can then \n\nassign that faction to the creature.\n\nHow do you know if one faction is friend or foe to another? In the \n\nDropdown Menu, select View  Factions and you�ll see the Faction \n\ntable for your module. This grid shows how Factions interrelate with 0�s \n\nrepresenting hostility, 50 representing a neutral relationship, and 100 \n\nrepresenting friendly.\n\nYou can Add and Remove factions and click on their entries in the grid to \n\nalter names and relationship numbers. The PC faction is the player character�s \n\nfaction. Note that the Lizardfolk Warrior is part of the Hostile faction which has \n\na �0� rating with the PC faction � the Lizardfolk Warrior hates the PC and will \n\nattack the player on sight. By changing the numbers in the relationship matrix, \n\nyou can influence the overall behavior of creatures without complicated \n\nscripting.\n\nWhen you�re done looking at the Factions window, click the �X� in the upper \n\nright corner to close it and return to the regular editing view.\n\n\nDungeons & Dragons Statistics\n\nDungeons & Dragons statistics are easy to modify on creatures, though the \n\nToolset does assume you know what classes, skills, feats, and spells do. Look \n\nat the Lizardfolk Warrior�s properties info again (in the upper right corner � \n\nmake sure the Lizardfolk Warrior is selected) and click on the �Basics� tab.\n\nHere you can modify the Lizardfolk Warrior�s basic properties like name, \n\nrace, and class. Try adding a level of fighter to the Lizardfolk Warrior. Click the \n\n�Add� button and notice that a new class appears in its Classes information. \n\nClick the Dropdown Menu to change the barbarian class to fighter. If you wish, \n\nassign a level using the up/down buttons to the right of the class name.\nUsing the properties window, you can switch between the tabs for Statistics, \n\nFeats, Skills, etc. to tinker with a creature�s various abilities.\n\n\nConversations\n\nConversations are placed on any object that will �talk� to the player. Creating \n\nnew conversations is covered in a different HowTo but learning to place them \n\nis very easy. Select the creature and, in that creature�s property window, look \n\nfor the �Conversation� field. Click on the field next to Conversation and click \n\nthe dropdown button. A list of conversations available in this module will \n\nappear and you may select the one to apply to the creature. Now, when the \n\nplayer tries to talk to this creature, the conversation event will take place.\n\n\nScripts\n\nScripts can be placed on creatures to expand their functionality and behavior. \n\nScripts are listed in the �Properties� tab and you can attach a script to various \n\nevents of the creature�s existence. A script placed in the �On Death� slot will \n\ntake place when the creature is killed, and �On Inventory Disturbed� script \n\nwould trigger when someone tries to pick its pockets and so forth. Creatures \n\nmade with the basic blueprints will have default scripts in all of these various \n\nslots, so you don�t need to know any scripting to have creatures do things like \n\nmove to a target, attack, use abilities, etc. As you become familiar with the \n\nToolset, you may wish to return to these fields later and try using new scripts� \n\nbut for now, you can safely ignore them.\n\n\nPlaceables\n\nPlaceables are the non-portable props of Neverwinter Nights 2. Placeables, like \n\ncreatures, have many settings and variables and can accept scripts and \n\nconversations. Placeables are generally used as dynamic props which the \n\nplayer can manipulate or destroy, or as static objects that exist as cosmetic \n\nfeatures in the game world.\n\n\nPlacing Placeables\n\nAs with creatures, placeables can be placed or spawned into a level, though \n\nspawning placeables is rarely necessary. To place a placeable, locate the \n\n�Blueprints� window in your Toolset. In the default setup, you�ll see this \n\nwindow in the lower-right corner of the screen. Press the �Placeables� button \n\n(the table symbol) to view all placeable blueprints. You�ll see several entries \n\nwith a �+� sign next to the name, click the �+� to expand the list.\n\nTry placing a cooking pot Look for 02 � MANMADE PROPS  POTS \n\n{03}\n\nClick on the Pots {03} entry and you will now be able to place a cooking pot \n\ninto the area. Move your cursor into the editing window and left click on the \n\nmap wherever you�d like to stamp down an instance of the cooking pot.\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Text in braces\n\nText that appears in {braces} will appear in the toolset but not in the game. \n\nWhen naming objects, you can include comments in braces that are notes to \n\nyourself but won�t be seen by the players. Goblin{strong} and Goblin{weak} \n\nwould both show up as just �Goblin� in the game. Similarly, a container called \n\n{Trapped}Chest would innocently appear as �Chest� in the game.\n\n\nModifying Placeables\n\nConversations and Scripts can be attached to placeables in exactly the same \n\nways as for creatures. Placeables have a few different ways scripts can trigger \n\ncompared to a creature, but the setup is the same and, as with creatures, you \n\nneed not bother with scripts just yet.\n\nConversations may seem an unlikely thing to add to a table, lamp, or \n\nother inanimate object. However, keep in mind that conversations are really \n\njust branching text and a placeable that is a box with three buttons on it could \n\nbest be represented with a conversation with four choices (one choice for each \n\nbutton and one to press nothing). For now, you won�t need to bother with \n\neither conversations or scripts on your placeables.\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Environmental Objects\n\nEnvironmental objects are decorative props that do not interact with \n\ncreatures in any way. While these objects are non-interactive and aren�t even \n\nsolid with respect to other creatures, they take very little CPU power compared \n\nto other, dynamic objects. If you wish to fill an area with lots of props and \n\nwould like to make those props completely cosmetic, you can convert them to \n\nenvironmental objects to streamline the performance of your level.\n\nTo change a placeable to environmental, simply select it and right-click on \n\nit in the editing window. You will see a dropdown window appear, select \n\nConvert  Placeables to Environmental Objects\n\nYou can return an Environmental object back to being a normal placeable by \n\nusing the command listed right under the one you just used.\n\nContainers are placeables that have inventory and can be used by a player \n\nto access the items and storage space. To set a placeable as a container, select \n\nthe placeable and look at its properties window.\n\nIn the Properties tab, make sure that the following fields are set as \n\nfollows:\nHas Inventory? = True\nInventory Size > 1, though 136 is average for a chest\nStatic = False\nUsable? = True\n\nTo change any of these properties, just click on the field next to the name. \n\nThese fields set the placeable as being capable of holding items and usable by \n\ncreatures. A player can now use this object in the game and take items from \n\nthis placeable (as well as store them). If this placeable is destroyed, it will drop \n\nany items it held.\n\n\nITEMS\n\nItems are mobile props, including weapons, armor, magic trinkets, keys, and \n\nall manner of objects meant to be transported and not stuck in the \n\nenvironment.\n\nWeapons, armor, magic tools, and other equipment-style items have \n\nmany fields and variables � creating and modifying items is covered in another \n\nHowTo. However, when placing your creatures and placeables in the world, \n\nyou will often want to put equipment and loot on them.\n\n\nPlacing Items on Creatures and Placeables\n\nCreatures and placeables have inventories where items are carried. Placing \n\nitems into either is roughly the same process. Start by selecting the creature or \n\nplaceable (for example, the lizardfolk in Pitney Lannon�s house) in the area and \n\nclicking on the �Inventory� tab of its Properties Panel. There will be an �Edit� \n\nbutton in the corner of this window, click it to access the creature�s inventory.\n\nLet�s add some more weapons to this Lizardfolk. Look for the Weapons \n\ncategory in the list of items in the lower-left. Click on the �+� next to Weapons \n\nto expand the categories of weapons.Then expand Bladed and Shortswords. \n\nYou may need to use the scroll bar to see all your options as the menus \n\nexpand.\n\nLook for entries called �The Icy Blade� and �The Lucky One� in the \n\nlower-left list of items. To equip an item onto a creature, click and drag the \n\nitem from the lower-left item list to one of the equipment slots on the \n\nright-hand side. The Icy Blade is a weapon and so will fit in a creature�s left or \n\nright hand � try clicking and dragging it to the left hand slot. If done correctly, \n\nthe item�s name will appear in the slot.\n\nTo put an item into a creature�s general inventory, click and drag it to the \n\nupper-left area. The name of the item will then appear in the general inventory \n\nsection.\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Item Instances\n\nWhen you give an item to a creature, you are creating a new instance of it. \n\nAs with placing instances of creatures, item instances are not directly linked to \n\ntheir parent blueprint. So if you edit an item blueprint, the instances of that \n\nitem you have already placed will not reflect the changes. Similarly, you can \n\nmodify an instance of a item without affecting other items made from the same \n\nblueprint. It is generally best to create items as blueprints instead of modifying \n\nspecific instances. Doing so will make it easier for you to later track down \n\nspecifics for any given item.\n\nThe two boxes next to each item in the inventory/equipment areas can be \n\nchecked to make an item droppable or pickpocketable. By default, when a \n\ncreature dies, all of its items go with it. An item flagged as �droppable� will be \n\nleft on the ground when its owner dies. An item flagged �pickpocketable� can \n\nbe lifted from its owner with the Sleight of Hand skill. Try flagging �The Lucky \n\nOne� as droppable.\n\nPlacing items on containers is done in the same manner as with creatures, \n\nbut placeables have only a general inventory. It�s also worth noting that \n\ndroppable and pickpocketable flags have no bearing on items in a container � \n\nif a container is destroyed, all items are left on the ground and containers have \n\nno pockets to pick (though they can be pried open and looted).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCreatures, placeables, and items are the actors and props of adventure. While \n\nall three of these objects have many variables and parameters, they are simple \n\nto place and the most important settings are easy to tweak.

You will learn a little about how \n\ncondition and action scripts can be used to make your conversations more \n\ninteresting and powerful. You will also learn how to attach the complete \n\nconversation to a creature in your module.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAnatomy of a Conversation\nConversation Scripting Basics\nConditions\nActions\nWriting a Dialogue\nSome Basic Conversation Tricks\nAttaching a Conversation to a Creature\nConclusion\n\n\nCONVERSATION BASICS\n\nConversations are an important aspect of NWN2 gameplay. They are used to \n\ntalk with companions, trade with a merchant, and get quest information from \n\nNPCs. At its heart, a conversation is really just a branching menu, so a \n\nconversation doesn�t necessarily have to be two people talking � if you want a \n\nplayer to encounter an inanimate control panel with three switches, a \n\nconversation with three responses would be an effective way of representing \n\nthe situation.\n\n\nANATOMY OF A CONVERSATION\n\nConversations can appear complicated at first, but you will soon be able to \n\nwrite them quickly.\n\nThis screenshot shows a portion of Pitney�s conversation in the Sample \n\nModule, 0100_UninvitedGuests. Conversations (sometimes referred to as \n\ndialogues) are arranged in a branching tree, not unlike a folder directory in \n\nWindows.\n\nEach row or line in the conversation is referred to as a node. The leftmost \n\nsection is the text, which is what is displayed to the player.\n\nRed nodes are lines that are spoken by the NPC. Blue nodes are the \n\nplayer�s responses. A blue �[CONTINUE]� means that the player has no choice \n\nto make at that node. In these cases, the conversation will proceed to the next \n\nred line, allowing an NPC to make multiple statements before the player \n\nresponds.\n\nThe text for the currently selected node. All of the information in the \n\nNode Properties section (D) refers to this node.\nA series of options from which the player can choose. After the preceding \n\nred node fires, the player will see these options and can click on (or press the \n\nnumber of) the one he wishes to select. Note the + sign to the left of these \n\nnodes, which shows that they can each be expanded.\nOther node information. By right-clicking on this region (choose \n\n�Columns�) you can set which columns of information will be displayed. In this \n\nscreenshot, you can see Actions, Conditions, and Quest information for each \n\nnode.\nNode Properties. This section contains more details on the selected \n\nnode.\nText. The text for the selected node is shown here. Just click on the text \n\nbox and type to change what the NPC says (red node) or what player option is \n\npresented (blue node).\n\nThe grey nodes are links to other nodes within the conversation. Using links \n\nprevents you from having to type the same line for the same situation.\n\nTo add a node to a conversation tree, just right click on the preceding node \n\nand choose Add. A �New Line� window will appear. Just type in the text you�d \n\nlike the player to see. (The language selection Dropdown Menu and the �Edit \n\nString Ref� button will not apply to your modules, but are used for the official \n\ncampaign.)\n\n\nCONVERSATION SCRIPTING BASICS\n\nScripting in NWN2 is very powerful and can be complicated. In creating the \n\nofficial campaign, we had many scripters who are a specialized type of \n\ndesigner (or a specialized type of programmer, depending upon your \n\nperspective) who spent their time mastering the scripting tools and \n\npossibilities, creating new global scripts to be used in area creation.\n\nThe details of scripting are beyond the scope of these HowTos, but we�ll \n\ndiscuss some of the very basics in the context of how scripts can be used in \n\nconversations. The best way to learn more about scripting is to experiment \n\nwith the Sample Module and see how we were able to create it. Then play \n\naround with conversations and scripts in your own modules.\n\n\nConditions\n\nConditions are test scripts that are attached to a conversation node and are \n\neither TRUE or FALSE. When a condition is TRUE, then that conversation node \n\nfires (is executed). For example, you might have an NPC who has two possible \n\ngreetings: the first is warm and friendly while the other is cold and standoffish.\n\nIf you placed a condition script on the first node to check if the player is \n\nan elf, then elves would get the warm greeting and other races the cold one. In \n\nthis case, the condition script is being used to help establish the personality of \n\nan NPC.\n\nIn the Sample Module, conditions are used to determine which of Pitney�s \n\ndialog nodes will be displayed, based upon the player�s quest state. If the \n\nplayer declined to help Pitney, then the poor fellow pleads again with the \n\nplayer. If the player has killed the lizardfolk, then Pitney expresses his \n\ngratitude.\n\nIf a condition is not met, then the player will never see that conversation \n\nnode. For a series of player responses (blue nodes), this might mean that the \n\nplayer only sees 3 of the 4 possible choices. For an NPC statement (red nodes), \n\nthe first node whose conditions are met is shown.\n\nIf you experiment with the Sample Module, you will notice that there are 5 \n\ninitial nodes for Pitney. Which one the player sees depends upon what has \n\nhappened so far.\n\nNode Properties Tabs. These tabs let you view different properties of the \n\nconversation node. (In this screenshot, the Conditions tab is shown.)\nCondition Operators. If a node has multiple conditions, you can specify \n\n�And� or �Or� to indicate whether they must all be true or if only some of them \n\nneed to be true for the node to fire.\nScript Name. This text box contains the name of the condition script. In \n\nthis case, the global script gc_journal_entry, which checks a journal (quest) \n\nentry, is being used.\nScript Parameters. The remainder of the row for each condition shows \n\nwhat parameters are passed to the condition script. In this case, the parameter \n\nsQuestTag is given the value �01_lizardfolk� and the parameter sCheck is given \n\nthe value �10.�\n\nThe use of script parameters is very powerful and allows a single script to \n\nbe used in dozens of conversations. For example, gc_journal_entry can be \n\nused to check any state for any quest in the entire game! The use of \n\nparameters for scripts is a new function of the NWN2 toolset.\n\nNote: If you add a global script to Conditions or Actions, or swap \n\none script for another, click the �Refresh� button to set the appropriate \n\nparameters for the new script.\nScript Code. The documentation and code for the condition script is \n\nshown in this window.\n\nActions\n\nAn action is a script that is used to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. An \n\naction script is executed when a conversation node fires. For example, an \n\naction could cause an NPC to become hostile to the player, move the player to \n\nanother map, or place gold in a treasure chest.\n\nIn the Sample Module, an action script is used to reward the player with \n\nexperience points for completing his quest for Pitney. Action scripts are set for \n\nnodes similar to how condition scripts are set.\n\n\nWRITING A CONVERSATION\n\nLet�s try writing a conversation for victim of the lizardfolk holed up in Pitney \n\nLannon�s house. The player can talk to this person after dispatching the \n\nlizardfolk.\nTo create a new conversation, use the Dropdown Menu at the top of the \n\nToolset and select File \" New \" Conversion.\n\nYour new dialogue will be entirely empty, save for the Root node. As \n\nmentioned in the earlier overview of a conversation, you can add your first line \n\nby right-clicking on the Root node and selecting �Add.� This will bring up the \n\nNew Line window where you can input the first line of the dialogue. Note that \n\nthe first line after the root is always an NPC line.\n\nOnce you hit �OK� the New Line is added and you have the introductory line \n\nfor the victim.\n\nIf you were to add a line to this red NPC line, you�d be adding a player \n\nresponse node. If you wanted the NPC to say two lines before the player \n\nresponded, you�d have to make an empty player node between the red NPC \n\nnodes. Try adding a blank line to the introduction.\n\n\nEnd Dialog? If a Player node has NO responses attached to it, it is a \n\nconversation-ending node. Let�s see what happens if we add another NPC line \n\nafter the highlighted, empty PC line.\n\nThe blue player node switched to [Continue] now that an NPC line follows \n\nit. Now that the NPC has said two lines, let�s add some player response nodes. \n\nTo give a player multiple possible responses at one time, add multiple times to \n\nthe same node. If you want three possible responses to the �I can�t feel my \n\nleg�� line, right-click then �Add� on that line three times.\n\nNow you have three possible PC responses to that line. Fill in text for each \n\nline by clicking on the line, and then typing in the text box (lower-right of the \n\ndialogue editor with the �Insert� button).\n\nSince these lines don�t yet have any text following them, they are \n\ndialogue-enders. If you�d like, you could continue to add NPC nodes, and \n\nsubsequent player nodes, to your heart�s content. The basics of adding lines \n\nare quite simple.\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Stores\n\nStores are only accessed through script in a conversation � they are not \n\nobjects that the player can detect. Stores have blueprints just like other types \n\nof objects. After you create your store�s blueprint, place it on the map \n\nnormally. It is generally best to place your store next to the NPC. Check out \n\nthe Sample Module for an example of a store.\n\nStore Dialogue Node. This is the dialogue node that accesses the store in \n\nthe Sample Module.\nScript ga_open_store. This action opens your store. It is given the store�s \n\ntag as a parameter.\nStore Properties Panel. To edit the contents of your store (and to initially \n\nassign its tag), open its Property Panel. Click on the �Store� tab, then click the \n\n�Edit� button to change its contents. You can them place instances of any \n\nblueprint item into your store.\nArea Contents. All stores in an area can be seen here under the �Store� \n\ntab.\n\n\nSOME BASIC CONVERSATION TRICKS\n\nLinks are an incredible time saver when writing large dialogues. If you want \n\nthe conversation to return to a previous set of options, links let you do so \n\nwithout typing re-typing everything over again.\n\nContinuing with the previous conversation, let�s say that the survivor is \n\nclinging to life, and if the player asks questions, the victim shortly collapses in \n\nexhaustion.\nIn effect, the dialogue would look like this:\n\nNotice that the �Why should I help you?� and �Who are you?� nodes lead \n\nto exactly the same text. Writing this out is more work than is necessary, and it \n\nclutters your conversation. There�s an easier way using links to streamline this \n\nconversation.\n\nFirst step is to remove everything after the �Who are you?� line � it�s no \n\nlonger needed. By Right-clicking on the �Please� help me�� line and selecting \n\n�Remove,� that red NPC node and all nodes connected to it are purged.\nNext step is to set the link. We want �Who are you?� to link to the line under \n\n�Why should I help you?� Right-click on that line and select �Set Link \n\nDestination.�\n\nThis flags the NPC node as being the new destination for any other player \n\nnode in the dialogue. Adding this to the �Who are you node?� is as simple as \n\nright-clicking on the node and selecting �Insert Link.�\n\nOnce in, you�ll see a grey node attached to �Who are you?� This indicates \n\nthat if the player were to select �Who are you?� they would get bounced to the \n\nsame node as if they selected �Why should I help you?�\n\nIf you ever forget where a particular gray node leads, just double-click it. \n\nThe editor will take you to the destination node.\n\nLinks make the difference between writing a large conversation in a few \n\nminutes versus a few hours.\nPipes and Braces can be used to write text that shows up in the Toolset but \n\nNOT in game. Thus, if you are writing a long conversation and need to leave \n\nnotes to yourself that you don�t want players seeing in game, you can place \n\nyour text in pipes, |like this| or in braces {like this}.\n\nThe line above may look messy but the player will only see the text \n\n�Thank you stranger, I won�t forget your kindness!� The conversation�s author \n\ncan keep tabs on what kind of response this is and leave a note to return later \n\nand add a bump to the player�s Good alignment � neither of these notes will \n\never show up in the actual gameplay.\n\nBarkstrings are conversations with only NPC nodes and no player \n\nresponses. When speaking to an object with a barkstring conversation, the \n\ngame does not stop for a full branching conversation. Instead, the one red \n\nnode of dialogue floats over the speaker�s head without any halt in gameplay.\n\nIn the Sample Module, 01_ginni is an example of a barkstring \n\nconversation. Pitney�s wife always speaks a single line and never allows the \n\nplayer to offer a response.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Fall-through\n\nFall-through is a term for creating multiple NPC nodes and assigning \n\nconditions so that, if the first node can�t be displayed, the process �falls \n\nthrough� to the next red NPC node down the line. As mentioned earlier in our \n\ndiscussion of conditions and actions, a node can be given a condition and if \n\nthat condition is FALSE, the line will not be displayed. Observe Pitney Lannon�s \n\nconversation:\n\nNotice how there are 5 red NPC nodes off of the root (indicated by the vertical \n\nline dropping down from the word Root).\n\nThe first red NPC node that is TRUE is displayed, and the conversation \n\nfollows the nodes under it � the other nodes are effectively ignored. Here, the \n\nauthor has used comments in pipes to indicate when and why each red NPC \n\nnode is used. When first speaking with Pitney, the first red line fires. Next time \n\nin the dialogue, the game checks to see if the player refused to help and if so, \n\nit plays the second red line, otherwise, it checks to see if he�s agreed to help� \n\nand so on.\n\nAs you experiment more with conditions, you can use fall-through to \n\ncreate very powerful, reactive conversations. The player may feel like it�s five \n\ncompletely different dialogues, all custom-tailored to what events took place \n\nalready when really, it�s just one conversation using fall-through to create a \n\nsmart dialogue.\n\nAdvanced Topic: One-time-only Nodes\n\nYou may occasionally want an NPC to speak a line once and never repeat \n\nit again. For example, in the Sample Module, Pitney�s initial conversation (in \n\nwhich he tells the player about his problem and begs for help) occurs only \n\nonce. After this, Pitney will respond based upon the player�s quest state. This is \n\nto create the illusion that Pitney knows and remembers the PC.\n\nTo set a dialog node as one-time-only, click the node in the Dialog Editor, \n\nand select the �Node� tab in the Node Properties window (at the bottom of the \n\nscreen). Click the �Show Once� field, and you will be able to select from a \n\ndrop-down menu. The �Show Once� field defaults to �Always,� which means \n\nthat the node will always appear, unless Conditions dictate otherwise.\n\nSet the �Show Once� tab to �Once per game� to ensure that the node will \n\nonly be called once, and will never appear again. Be certain that a fall-through \n\nnode follows the once-only node, however, or the conversation will simply \n\nclose.\n\nFor Persistent Worlds, it may be wiser to set the �Show Once� field to \n\n�Once per creature that uses this conversation.� Otherwise, the node will be \n\ndisplayed for the first player who views the dialog, but will never appear again!\n\n\nATTACHING A CONVERSATION TO A CREATURE\n\nConversations are placed on any creature or object that will talk to the player. \n\nSelect the creature or placeable and, in that object�s property window, look for \n\nthe �Conversation� field. Click on the field next to Conversation and click the \n\ndropdown button. A list of conversations available in this module will appear \n\nand you may select the one to apply to the creature. Now, when the player \n\ntries to talk to this creature, the conversation event will take place.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNeverwinter Nights 2 offers an extremely powerful conversation system that \n\ncan look intimidating at first but is quite simple to use. Put your writing skills \n\nto the test and see what sort of conversations you can offer your players!

You will also gain a more detailed understanding of \n\ntwo specific types of triggers: speak triggers and area transitions.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nWhat is a Trigger?\nPlacing a Speak Trigger\nArea Transition Triggers\nConclusion\n\n\nWHAT IS A TRIGGER?\n\nUnlike most objects that are placed in the game world, triggers are usually \n\ninvisible to players. They behave as their name suggests � when a PC crosses \n\nthe border of a trigger, something happens. A trigger might activate a dialog, \n\nspring a trap, or spawn a gang of monsters.\n\nIf you have played the Sample Module, �Uninvited Guests,� then you have \n\nalready encountered a simple trigger. When you first approached Pitney \n\nLannon, your PC entered an invisible speak trigger. This trigger caused Pitney \n\nto run toward you and opened his dialog window.\n\nThe toolset provides a set of pre-made triggers for quick and easy use. \n\nMore advanced modders will probably make extensive use of the �generic� \n\ntrigger, which can activate custom scripts and is highly versatile. For the \n\npurposes of this tutorial, however, we will focus on some simple pre-made \n\ntriggers.\n\n\nPLACING A SPEAK TRIGGER\n\nA speak trigger opens the dialog window and launches a Conversation file. \n\nTo place a speak trigger in the world, first open an Area in your module. Then \n\nlocate the �Blueprints� panel, and select the �Triggers� tab.\n\nClick �SpeakTrigger,� and move your mouse pointer into the Area Viewer. Note \n\nthat the mouse pointer looks like a crosshairs, instead of an arrow.You will \n\nnow define the borders of a new SpeakTrigger.\n\nClick once in the Area Viewer to set the first corner of your trigger. Then \n\nclick another point nearby � a line will be drawn, connecting the two points. \n\nClick two more points to define a square or rectangle. Press F2 (or right-click \n\nonce), and your mouse pointer will return to default mode. A trigger can be \n\nany shape. You set as many corners as you like, and the toolset will adjust \n\nyour trigger�s shape accordingly.\n\nOnce you have created a trigger, you can move it around the Area, just \n\nlike any other placeable object. Click your trigger once, and click-and-drag it \n\nwherever you want.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Reshaping Triggers\n\nIf you don�t like the current shape of a trigger, you can right-click it and \n\nselect �Repaint Trigger� from the Dropdown Menu. This turns your mouse \n\npointer back into a crosshairs. As soon as you click once in the Area Viewer, \n\nyour old trigger shape will disappear, and you�ll be able to set a new one. \n\nWhen you Repaint a trigger, any properties that you have already set on that \n\ntrigger remain unchanged.\n\nYour trigger is now placed in the world, but you will need to set its \n\nproperties before it will have any in-game effect. Start by selecting (clicking) \n\nyour trigger. Then take a look at the Properties Panel.\n\nFirst, be sure that the �Properties� tab is selected. Scroll down to the �Scripts� \n\nsection. Notice that the On Enter Script is already set to gtr_speak_node. Do \n\nnot change or delete this script � it provides the basic functionality for a speak \n\ntrigger.\n\nAt the bottom of the �Scripts� section is a line labeled �Variables.� Click the \n\nfield to the right of the �Variables� label (you should see some boldfaced black \n\ntext in this field), and a browse button (labeled with ellipses) should appear. \n\nClick the browse button to open the Variables window.\n\nYou should see nine variables listed in the new window, labeled 0 through 8. \n\nClick on each of these to view its settings on the right-hand side of the \n\nwindow. We�ll review the most important of these variables, in turn.\n\nNPC_Tag. Determines the NPC who will be initiating conversation with \n\nthe player. Enter this character�s tag in the �ValueString� field. In the sample \n\nmodule, ValueString is set to 01_pitney, which is Pitney Lannon�s tag.\nConversation. The most important field � your trigger will do nothing if \n\nthis field is left blank. This field specifies the tag of the conversation launched \n\nby your trigger. Enter this conversation�s tag in the ValueString field. In the \n\nsample module, ValueString is set to 01_pitney, which is the tag of Pitney�s \n\nconversation.\nRun. Determines whether the NPC will approach your character when the \n\ndialog begins. If you set the ValueInt field to 1, the NPC will run to your \n\ncharacter. If you set ValueInt to 0, the NPC will walk. If you set ValueInt to -1, \n\nthe NPC will remain where he is. In the sample module, this variable is set to \n\n1, so that Pitney comes running over to your character as his dialog \n\nbegins.\nTalkNow. Determines whether the dialog starts before the NPC \n\napproaches your character. Set the ValueInt field to 1 if you want the dialog to \n\nstart immediately. Set ValueInt to 0 if you don�t want the dialog to start until \n\nthe NPC reaches your character. In the sample module, this variable is set to 0, \n\nso that Pitney�s dialog doesn�t open until Pitney runs over to your \n\ncharacter.\nMultiUse. Determines whether the trigger will fire every time a PC enters \n\nit, or if it fires only once per game. Set ValueInt to 1 if you want the trigger to \n\nfire every time a PC crosses its border. If you leave ValueInt set to 0, the \n\ntrigger will only fire once. In the sample module, this variable is set to 0, so \n\nthat Pitney only initiates his conversation the first time the player enters the \n\nspeak trigger.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Speak Triggers and Combat\n\nCombatCutsceneSetup. This special variable is useful when a speak trigger is \n\nplaced in a dangerous area. If there is a chance that hostile enemies might be \n\nnearby when a player enters the speak trigger, set this variable to 1. This will \n\ncause all hostile creatures to disappear for the duration of the triggered \n\nconversation (and prevents your player from being attacked while stuck � and \n\nhelpless � in dialog). In the sample module, there is no chance of any hostile \n\ncreatures attacking the player in the Lannon Farm area, so this variable is set to \n\n0.\n\nAfter the conversation, the hostile creatures will be returned and game \n\nplay will continue normally.\nIf you have assigned a conversation tag to the Conversation variable, assigned \n\nan NPC tag to the NPC_Tag variable, and made sure that this NPC is placed in \n\nyour Area, then your speak trigger is ready to test in game!\nNow that you have learned the basics of placing a trigger, we will discuss \n\nanother trigger type: the area transition.\n\n\nAREA TRANSITION TRIGGERS\n\nAn area transition allows the player to move from one area to another by \n\nwalking over a trigger. They are useful in situations where a door is \n\ninappropriate (for example, if you want the PC to leave an area by walking \n\ndown a road). This section explains the basic functionality of area transition \n\ntriggers, defines parameters that need to be set, and notes how they differ \n\nfrom speak triggers.\n\nPlace an area transition in the same way as a Speak Trigger. To properly \n\nset an area transition so that it will transport players to the area of your choice, \n\nfirst select your area transition trigger, and look at the Properties panel and \n\ntab.\n\nLocate the �Behavior� section, and set the following fields:\n\nLink object type. Determines whether your area transition will send the \n\nplayer to a door or a waypoint. From the dropdown menu, select �Transition to \n\na door� if you want the player to be sent directly to a door object.\n\nSelect �Transition to a waypoint� if you want the player to be sent to a \n\nparticular placed waypoint. (If you select �No Transition,� then your area \n\ntransition will do nothing.)\n\nLinked to. Sets the tag of the door or waypoint destination. [Note: You \n\nmust be certain that this tag matches the tag of your door or waypoint exactly, \n\nand that this door or waypoint is actually placed somewhere in your \n\nmodule.]\n\nParty Transition. Determines whether the entire party is sent to the \n\ndestination door or waypoint. If this field is set to true, the entire party will be \n\ntransitioned to the new area when any one member of that party enters the \n\narea transition trigger.\n\nIf this field is set to false, and a member of the party enters the area transition \n\ntrigger, that member will be sent to the new area, but the other party \n\nmembers will be left behind. In general, it is a good idea to set this field to \n\nTrue.\n\nLocalized Name. You can use this field to remind yourself of an area \n\ntransition�s purpose and/or destination. It is not displayed to players.\n\nIf you have set the properties described above, and made certain that your \n\ndestination door or waypoint is placed somewhere in your module, then your \n\narea transition is ready to test in game!\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: World Map\n\nIt is also possible to set up transitions that bring the player to a World \n\nMap. The world map is an image that you create that depicts an abstracted \n\nmap of your entire game world. You can place map points on the map, with an \n\nimage (such as a city or dungeon icon) associated with each.\n\nWhen the player goes to the World Map, they can just select their desired \n\ndestination and they will transport there instantly. You can even set-up scripts \n\nto cause special events to occur when the player travels to certain areas at \n\ndifferent points in the adventure.\n\nTo experiment with the World Map Editor, go to Plugins  World Map \n\nEditor.\n\nThe global script gtr_world_map_en is used in the Official Campaign as an \n\nOnEnter script for all triggers that serve as World Map transitions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTriggers are a useful tool in area design and allow you to create events that \n\nhappen based upon the location of the player. Now that you�ve completed this \n\nHowTo, you should know:\n\nHow to place a trigger in the game world, and how to redraw it, if \n\nnecessary.\nHow to trigger a dialog from a trigger.\nHow to use triggers to transition from one Area to another.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"9":{"Name":"NWN2 TOOLSET HOWTO� CREATING ITEMS","Author":"Obsidian","Submitted":20061004,"Updated":20061004,"Category":"Toolset","Description":"NWN2 TOOLSET HOWTO� CREATING ITEMS\n\n\nThis HowTo discusses the basics of items and how to create them. By the end \n\nof this HowTo, you�ll know about most of the many properties items can have, \n\nas well as how to create your own items. You�ll also have learned about how to \n\ncreate custom appearances for items that appear in game, such as weapons \n\nand armors.\n\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWhat Is An Item?\nCreating An Item Blueprint\nCreating An Unequippable Item\nCreating An Equippable Item - Weapons\nCreating An Equippable Item - Armor\nConclusion\n\n\nWHAT IS AN ITEM?\n\nAnything in the game (or your module, for example) that can be picked up and \n\nused in some fashion � that is an item. All armors, all weapons, all potions, all \n\nquest items � all the useful things that populate a world, from the magic sword \n\nin the troll�s lair to the gold coins you sell it to the merchant for.\n\nItems fall into two categories: equippable and unequippable. Equippable \n\nitems include jewelry, weapons, armor � things that a character can \n\nconceivably place upon their body or wield in their hands. Unequippable \n\nobjects are items that are never actually placed on a character�s body - they \n\nnever take up an armor or weapon slot - and may or may not have an effect.\n\nUnequippable items can provide a passive effect when held in one�s \n\ninventory, can be disposable (such as potions or scrolls), can be used in \n\ncrafting (such as raw materials), or simply take up space (such as a quest \n\nitem).\n\nSince equippable and unequippable items can have very different effects, \n\nthis tutorial will walk you through making both types, creating a sample of \n\neach for use in the Lannon Farm module.\n\n\nCREATING AN ITEM BLUEPRINT\n\nTo create a new item, click on the �Items� tab in the Blueprint Menu to bring \n\nup all of the items in the game. Right-click anywhere in the New Item field to \n\nbring up a small pop-up menu: within that menu, go to �Create Blueprint,� and \n\nselect �Module� (this is unless you wish to create an item usable in any \n\nmodule: if you want to do that, select �Global� instead).\n\nThis process creates a new item template for you to work with within that \n\nparticular module group.\n\nNote: another method for item creation involves copying an existing \n\nblueprint by clicking on the particular item, right-clicking to bring up the \n\nDropdown Menu, and selecting �Copy Blueprint.�\n\nThis creates an identical version of that blueprint to modify � which can be \n\nbeneficial for creating items that only need to be slightly modified from an \n\noriginal version.\n\nWithin the item template are multiple fields that determine the properties \n\nof an item:\n\nNote: Some tabs are closed in this screenshot because they do not \n\ndirectly deal with items being created. The Armor tab is closed here because it \n\ndeals exclusively with armor items, which are addressed after this section. The \n\nMisc & and Scripts fields are not used in the creation of standard game items \n\nand are thus not touched-on here beyond a brief explanation.\n\nAppearance. This section briefly determines the general look of your \n\nitem, particularly weapons.\nAppearance (special effect) � a list of special effects that can be attached \n\nto an item. Typically these are not necessary, as weapon effects are actually \n\nhard-coded: any weapon with an elemental enhancement bonus that averages \n\nto 3 or higher (i.e., 1d6 and up, not 1d4) automatically gains an appropriate \n\nvisual effect. Visual effects can also be set in the �Behavior� section.\nContainer UI Screen � sets what background graphic is used when a \n\nplaceable container is opened. Should be left at the default for item-creation \n\npurposes.\nIcon � what icon the item uses (pulls from the list in \n\nnwn2_icons.2da).\nModel Part � what model the item uses (only important for certain \n\nequippable items, such as weapons and bard instruments. Wearable items use \n\nthe armor set tool and are discussed later).\nTint � the colors that the item model is tinted (shown in RGB \n\nvalues).\nBehavior. How the item works within the game world.\nAdditional Cost � how much the item will cost in addition to the preset \n\nvalues (seen three lines below in the unmodifiable �Base Cost� area). Every \n\nitem is given a base cost in the baseitems.2da: any enchantments on the item \n\nare given values via code and added on to the cost.\n\nIf the user desires any modifications in addition to this code-based value, it can \n\nbe added here (or set as a negative value to decrease the price).\nArmor Type (for game rules) � sets the armor type (via the preset armor \n\nrules in the 2das). Only important for base armor sets.\nArmor Rules Info � CANNOT MODIFY. Gives a list of all of the rules \n\nattributes for the selected armor type.\nBase Cost � CANNOT MODIFY. Lists the base cost of the selected item \n\ntype.\nBase Item � determines the actual item type. This is likely the most \n\nimportant field in the entire blueprint (aside from the resref, which is discussed \n\nbelow) because it determines item elements such as model used, item weight, \n\nweapon stats, and base cost (all of these individual settings are controlled by \n\nthe baseitems.2da file, and cannot be modified within the toolset itself).\nCharges � how many total charges a magical item has (only useful for \n\nitems that cast a spell, and that the user only wants to have a particular \n\nnumber of charges � different spells can have different charge costs, and even \n\nbe recharged if desired)\nContainer Preference � which type of container the item defaults into \n\nwhen picked up: default is the standard player inventory. This setting can be \n\nused, for example, to have a potion box that, by default, will store the player�s \n\npotions.\nCursed � sets the item to be cursed (non-droppable, non-disarmable until \n\na Remove Curse or similar spell is cast on it).\nDroppable � whether or not NPCs will drop that item (default set to false \n\n� usually handled on a case-by-case basis when an item is placed on an NPC - \n\nfor example, you may want an ogre to drop the club he wields, but a troll \n\nwouldn�t drop his claws).\nForce Into Preferred Container � whether the item can be dropped into a \n\ncontainer other than their preferred one (like preventing arrows from going \n\nanywhere but in a quiver, or gems in a gem bag)\nIdentified � whether or not the item is identified, or needs a Lore \n\ncheck/Identify spell cast on it before it is able to be equipped (for magic items \n\nin NWN2, this is usually set to False).\nItem Properties � any special abilities that an item has (things like Cast \n\nSpell, Enhancement Bonus [+2], Damage Vulnerability: Acid) � these are all \n\nset in a pop-up menu that accompanies this field.\nItem Property Activation Preference � controls when an item is able to \n\nuse its special properties. Items such as weapons are only active when \n\nequipped, while items such as charms can have abilities when they are in \n\nrepository (i.e., inventory). Items can also be set to give effects in both \n\nsituations (equipped and unequipped).\nPickpocketable � whether or not an item can be pickpocketed (default set \n\nto false � usually handled on a case-by-case basis when an item is placed on \n\nan NPC).\nPlot � whether or not an item is vital to the Plot of the game (such as a \n\nquest item). Prevents item from being destroyed or moved from the character�s \n\ninventory.\nStack Size � how many items of that type appear at once when the item is \n\nplaced in game (a stack size of 1 for an item means only one of that item will \n\nappear at once, while a stack size of 50 means that 50 of that item will appear \n\nat once)\nStolen � whether or not the item is stolen, and thus cannot be sold to \n\nmerchants who are not tagged as Black Market vendors (default set to false � \n\nusually handled on a case-by-case basis when an item is placed on an \n\nNPC)\nBlueprint. How the toolset is able to track the item.\nComment � basic field to jot down comments. This information is never \n\nvisible to the player within the game.\nTemplate Resref � resref of the blueprint that an instance came from (key \n\nfor placed instances within modules). Each item must have a unique \n\nresref.\nGeneral. How the item is categorized and described.\nClassification � how the item is ordered within the toolset\nLocalized Description � base descriptive text for the item: this appears on \n\nnormal items, or unidentified items before they have been identified.\nLocalized Description (when identified) � descriptive text for the item after \n\nit has been identified.\nLocalized Name � the name of the item.\nResource Name � the name of the actual file on disk (the official filename \n\nof the item)\nTag � name by which an object can be referred to in script [Note: the \n\ntag, Resource Name, and Template Resref are all usually the same name, to \n\nkeep things simple]. It is generally best to use unique tags, but unlike resrefs, \n\ntwo items can have the same tag.\n5. Misc. Deals with the UV scroll, which is used to determine how fast the \n\ntexture of the item scrolls in the U and V directions (typically used to add the \n\nproper �flowing� look to things like water elementals and lava flows).\nScripts. Additional scripts attached to an item (beyond the standard \n\nones). For example, taking gem bag could trigger a script that causes its owner \n\nto attack you.\nStatistics. Sets the item�s material properties.\nDamage Reductions � sets the item�s damage reduction (not a damage \n\nreduction property granted to the wielder, but the properties of the item \n\nitself).\nMaterial � what the item is made of, which is used for weapons and \n\narmor in order to determine its effect on certain monsters, and vice-versa. For \n\nexample, lycanthropes are resistant to weapons that aren�t made with \n\nalchemical silver.\n\nNow that the terms have all been defined, you have the foundation you need \n\nto create items.\n\n\nCREATING AN UNEQUIPPABLE ITEM\n\nThe first item to be created for the example is a non-equippable item � Pitney \n\nLannon�s prized bottle of 1363 Harvest Mead. Follow the steps listed above to \n\ncreate a new module-specific item, and you can start filling in the particulars of \n\nthat item.\n\nWhen setting up a new item, set the item�s Localized Name and its \n\nResource Name/Tag/Template Resref at the same time. As soon as you set \n\nthese, the item will appear in the Items directory.\n\nOnce the name and resrefs have been set, you need to set the Base Item \n\n(in the Behavior field). In the example case, because the Harvest Mead is a \n\nsmall, unequippable item with no special properties needed, it should be set to \n\nbe a �Miscellaneous Small Object� (this will assure that is assigned the proper \n\nsettings from the baseitems.2da) � use the Dropdown Menu in the Base Items \n\nfield to select it, and hit �Enter� to confirm your choice.\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: 2da Files\n\nThe term 2da stands for �2 dimensional array.� 2da Files are used by NWN2 to \n\ncontain data for many aspects of the game, including spells, character classes, \n\nand feats. The 2da files are located in the Data folder. baseitems.2da specifies \n\nthe basic parameters for many different types of items. Each row in a 2da is \n\none entry and each column is a field.\n\nFor example, all greatswords share the same row in the baseitems.2da. \n\nThey all do the same amount of base damage, are equipped with two hands, \n\nchoose their models from the same set of options, etc. Potions, rings, \n\nscimitars, etc. each have their own row in baseitems.2da.\n\n\nOnce these main parts of the item are set, the only things that remain are \n\nsetting the icon for the item (selecting the icon field will create a drop-down, \n\nscrolling menu just like the Base Item field: change the icon from temp0 to \n\nit_spirits), setting the desired value in the Plot field (it is not necessary to \n\nprevent the Mead from being dropped or destroyed, so the field will remain set \n\nto False in this case), and writing a proper description for the item in the \n\nLocalized Description field.\n\nTo give the item a little more variety (and to provide an example of how \n\nan unequippable item can provide passive bonuses by sitting in one�s \n\ninventory), open up the �Item Properties� tab to add a special property to the \n\nitem.\n\nScroll through the Available Properties to the Skill Bonus section, and \n\nopen it up to find the Concentration skill. Click on the �Add Property� button to \n\nadd the property to the item, then select the bonus and look beneath the \n\nAvailable Properties field to the tabbed �Selected Property� field. Set the Cost \n\nValue (in this case, the bonus to Concentration) to +2, and click OK to confirm \n\nthe selection.\n\n\nFinally, in order to get the Concentration bonus to actually show up for \n\nthe player (since the item can not be equipped), change the Item Property \n\nActivation Preference to ITEMPROP_ACTIVE_REPOSITORY_ONLY, which will \n\nmake the item properties only apply when the object is in the character�s \n\ninventory.\n\nThe item should be ready to place within the module.\n\n\nCREATING AN EQUIPPABLE ITEM - WEAPONS\n\nNow that an unequippable item has been created for the module, it is time to \n\ncreate a pair of suitable equippable items: a weapon and an armor. In terms of \n\nweapons, it just so happens that Pitney Lannon is in possession of a quality \n\nclub perfect for harassing pesky lizardfolk: he may lack the courage to use it \n\nhimself, but this hardly prevents him from passing it on to an enterprising \n\nyoung soul who might make better use of it�\n\nTo craft a weapon (Lannon�s Reptile Bane Cudgel in this example), follow \n\nthe usual instructions to create a new module-specific item (right-click on \n\n�Items,� Create Blueprint -> Module). As with creating an unequippable item, \n\nset the item name and resref first.\n\nOnce the name and resref have been set, go to the Base Item field and \n\nselect an equippable item type from the list (�Club� in this case). Since the Club \n\nbase item is a weapon, now there will be an actual model available to \n\nselect\n\nNote: this is the case with most equippable items, but not all � \n\nbracers, rods, wands, and jewelry do not have visible models set for them.\n\nMove up to the Appearance area and set the desired model number in the \n\nModel Part fields: different base items have a different number of available \n\nmodels and model types, and some have interchangeable model types \n\n(swapping out different hilts, blades, and pommels on swords, for example).\n\nTo find out what model (or combination of models) looks ideal, it is a \n\ngood idea to change the Model Part values one at a time and swap between the \n\n�Properties� and �Preview� tabs to see how the item changes [Note: if a black \n\nquestion-marked cube appears in the Preview window, that is because there is \n\nno model set for the given model number].\n\nFor the Reptile Bane Cudgel example, type in �2� in the first Model Part \n\nfield � this will select the second available club model (the metal one). You will \n\nbe able to check the model by clicking the �Preview� tab at the top of the \n\nwindow, and navigating through the window by using the mouse scroll button \n\nto zoom, Ctrl+right-click to move the model around, and \n\nCtrl+middle-button-click to tilt the camera\n\nNote: the �Preview� option on the top bar must be selected, or no \n\nmodel will appear in the Preview window\n\nOnce the club appears correctly, open up the Tint mini-menu in the \n\nAppearance area. Three set tints will appear � click on one to bring up the \n\nColor Edit Form.\n\nThe Color Edit Form sets the individual tints on a model, either by \n\nselecting a color by hand from the palette on the left, or by selecting a named \n\nswatch on the right (the names of each swatch appear when the mouse cursor \n\nis hovered over each swatch).\n\nIt�s often helpful to set the tint values initially to very bright colors (like \n\npure red, green, or blue) so that it is very obvious between switching from the \n\n�Properties� tab to the �Preview� tab which tint is connected to what part of the \n\nmodel. In the case of the club model 2, the Model Tint 1 controls the main \n\nbody of the club, the second tint controls the color of the handle, and the third \n\ntint governs the color of the wrapping.\n\nFor this example, swatches will be used to select the colors of the Reptile \n\nBane Cudgel: Darker Cool Brown for Tint 1, Medium Cool Brown for Tint 2, \n\nand Darker Pea Green for Tint 3. Once the tints are set, check the Preview \n\nwindow to see how it looks.\n\nOnce the appearance of the club is set, follow the same sequence of \n\nevents to finish up the item as on an unequippable item � setting the icon \n\n(it_wu_clubpoison), writing up a description, and setting a proper set of Item \n\nProperties.\n\nFor the Reptile Bane Cudgel, it is important for the weapon to have a \n\nproper bonus against Reptiles to suit its name. Click on the Item Properties \n\nfield and select the �Attack Bonus vs. Racial Group� ability, scroll down and \n\nselect �Reptilian� from the list, and change the Cost Value of the ability to +3. \n\nTo strengthen the weapon a bit more, scroll down to �Enhancement Bonus� \n\nand add that property as well, setting the Cost Value to +1. [Note: you can \n\nadd numerous additional properties to items in this same fashion].\n\nOnce the Item Properties are set, scroll down to the Statistics section and \n\nset the Material field to �Metal (Iron)�: while not terribly critical for this \n\nparticular weapon, it�s good practice to set the value for every weapon, in case \n\none wishes to make an item out of a different material. Certain materials are \n\nset to give specialized effects, such as Cold Iron (effective against demons) or \n\nDarksteel (deals an additional +1 electricity damage), and can be a valuable \n\naddition to many types of items.\n\nOnce this field is set, the weapon should be ready for use.\n\n\nCREATING AN EQUIPPABLE ITEM - ARMOR\n\nAfter creating a properly equippable weapon, there are only a few additional \n\nsteps to be learned to create an armor set. Pitney�s Militia Armor should \n\nprovide a good introduction on how to spruce up a base armor model with a \n\nfew appropriate attachments, and an additional feat and spell bonus.\n\nTo create a set of armor, follow the same steps as creating a standard \n\nequippable item: create the blueprint, set the item name and resrefs, and set \n\nthe Base Item to �Armor.� Once the Base Item has been set to �Armor,� set the \n\nArmor Type field to the desired style of armor (in this case, Pitney is a simple \n\nvillage militiaman, so Padded armor should work nicely). When the Armor \n\nType is set, you will see the ArmorRulesInfo field below (in gray) update to \n\nreflect the rules for that particular armor type.\n\n\nOnce the Armor Type has been set, select the �Armor Set� tab on the far \n\nright of the blueprint menu � this will help you to set the actual appearance of \n\nthe armor itself [Note: the model for the Armor Set tool is a human male: \n\nwhile the majority of the base armor models are identical in appearance across \n\nrace and gender, some armors may appear different on some race/gender \n\ncombinations]\n\nAs with the Preview window, navigation within the Armor Set window is \n\ncontrolled with a combination of the middle mouse button and the Ctrl key: \n\nthe mouse scroll controls zoom, Ctrl-middle -click rotates the model, and \n\nmiddle -click-drag moves the model. It is important to note that when using \n\nthe Armor Set tool that one should turn OFF the Preview option along the top \n\nbar of the window: the Armor Set tool will be useable either way, but turning \n\noff the Preview option prevents armor flickering within the Armor Set tool \n\nwhen the Preview window loads an updated model.\n\nThe first thing to do when creating an armor within the Armor Set \n\nwindow is to set the base appearance of the model, which is listed under the \n\nMain Type (which controls the armor appearance type) and Main Variation \n\n(selects model variation within the main type) menus. The two armors below \n\nare both scale mail, for example, but use different variations.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Untraditional Armors\n\nIt is possible for the armor appearance and the Armor Type (from the \n\n�Properties� tab) to be set differently, so one could have armor that looked like \n\ncloth but had the properties of Full Plate mail, and vice versa. This is an option \n\nfor armor creation, but moreover something to be aware of when creating \n\narmor.\n\nFor the purposes of the example, select the �Padded� armor from the Main \n\nType menu in the �Armor Set� tab, and select variation 0 for the set.\n\nThe second step of creating armor is to decide on the armor attachments. \n\nOn the bottom right of the Armor Set tab is a scrolling menu listing each \n\narmor attachment slot, which allows the user to pick what armor attachment \n\nthey would like to put in what location [Note: as per the note above, armor \n\nappearance and Armor Type are not inherently linked, so it is possible to use \n\nany attachment on any base armor without influencing its stats.] To place an \n\nattachment, scroll to the desired attachment location (such as �Left leg�), open \n\nup the Dropdown Menu (which lists the models available for that attachment \n\nslot), and select the desired attachment.\n\nFor Pitney�s armor, since it�s a bit fancier than the armor of the other \n\nmilitiamen, he�s been given burly leather shoulderpads (Left shoulder: 7, Right \n\nshoulder: 3), mismatched arm and knee attachments from wear-and-tear \n\n(Right bracer: 21, Left arm: 18, Left Knee: 3, Right Knee: 4), and matched \n\nlegwear to protect his thighs (Left & Right Leg: 17).\n\nAfter the basic armor attachments have been set, you can apply gear \n\nattachments as well. Gear attachments are items that are not directly attached \n\nto the armor itself: helms, belts, gloves, cloaks, and boots. Gear attachments \n\nare located directly beneath the Main type armor setting, and are handled in an \n\nidentical fashion.\n\nIn the example, to equip the given armor set with leather gloves, scroll \n\ndown in the menu to the Gloves Type menu, click the check-box next to the \n\nmenu to turn on the gear attachment, select �Leather,� and set the desired \n\nvariation (model #3). Using this same method for the other attachments, you \n\ncan easily set the armor set to have a very unique and distinctive look with no \n\nhassle.\n\nAfter all of the attachments have been set, you can begin tinting the \n\narmor. Next to each armor piece � main, attachment, and base � there are \n\nthree squares that control the tint color for each piece of armor, in order of \n\nimportance (first color covers the bulk of the item, with the second and third \n\ncolors as the secondary and tertiary details). When setting a tint, click on a tint \n\nbutton and select a color within the Color Edit Form (which is identical to the \n\none used to set weapon tints).\n\nAlthough the base armor is only able to take the latter two tints listed, it is \n\npossible to set three tints on it temporarily: this is done in order to take \n\nadvantage of the �Apply To All� button that sits immediately below the main \n\narmor tint buttons. The �Apply To All� button automatically migrates the color \n\nsettings of the base armor to all of the armor attachments so that they do not \n\nneed to be set individually (but they can be if desired).\n\nFor Pitney�s armor, if the main colors are set to be (in order of \n\nappearance) Pale Warm Brown, Darker Yellow Orange, and Dark Yellow \n\nOrange, only the second two tints will actually appear on the base armor, but \n\npressing the �Apply to All� button will set all of the armor attachments to those \n\nsame settings.\n\nNote: gear attachments are not included in this change; they are \n\ntinted individually.\n\nThe below examples show a screenshot previous to pressing the �Apply to \n\nAll� button (left picture), and after (right picture): you can see that the base \n\narmor tints featured at the top have been migrated to the attachments, and are \n\nshowing up on the model.\n\nOnce all of the attachments and gear are set and properly tinted, return to \n\nthe �Properties� tab to finish up the item: setting the icon used \n\n(it_al_padded04 for the example), the material type (since the example armor \n\nis padded, it should be kept as �Non-Specific�), other desired property tweaks, \n\nand setting the Item Properties.\n\nIn terms of the example: Pitney once won a bet with Tarmas, so the local \n\nwizard grudgingly enchanted the item with a pair of smaller spells � the Item \n\nProperties should be set up to reflect this. Open up the Item Properties menu, \n\nopen up the �Bonus Feat� selection in the Available Properties menu, and select \n\nthe �Toughness� feat � this is one of many available feats that can be included \n\non an item for a character to take advantage of.\n\nIn addition to this, scroll down to the �Cast Spell� selection in the menu, select \n\nthe �Light� spell, and set the Cost Value to 1 Use/Day.\n\nIf the player wants to use this spell, they can equip the armor, and \n\nright-click on the armor in their inventory to bring up the menu to cast the \n\nspell � or use the Item Property Activation Preference to set the item�s magical \n\nproperties to be usable even when the item is unequipped.\n\n\nOnce the properties of the armor have been set, save the changes made � and \n\nthe armor should be ready to be placed into a module and used.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAlthough a first glance at the many fields and settings of an item blueprint may \n\nappear intimidating, it should quickly become an easy thing to swiftly create all \n\nkinds of items � both fantastical and mundane � with which to populate one�s \n\nmodules. Now that you have completed this HowTo, you should know:\n\nSome of the various properties that can be assigned to items.\nHow to create new equippable and unequippable models.\nHow to customize specific weapon and armor appearances.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"10":{"Name":"NWN2 TOOLSET HOWTO - MAP MAKING","Author":"Obsidian","Submitted":20061004,"Updated":20061004,"Category":"Toolset","Description":"NWN2 TOOLSET HOWTO - MAP MAKING\n\n\nMap making is a rewarding part of creating your module. It�s the first thing the player sees after making his \n\ncharacter. The Neverwinter Nights 2 map making tools are incredibly flexible and you now have far more \n\ncontrol over terrain and prop placement. With the added functionality comes more complexity. This \n\ndocument goes over the basics of exterior and interior map making and how to place the various objects.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWhat are Exterior and Interior Maps?\nExterior Environment Basics\nToolbar\nDay/Night Settings\nArea Properties\nUsing Environmental Tools\nBrush\nTerrain\nTexturing\nGrass\nWater\nPlacing Objects\nPlaceables\nEnvironmental Objects\nTrees\nPoint Lights\nPlaced Effects\nPrefabs\nLevel Baking\nWalkmesh Painting\nWalkmesh Cutter (Trigger)\nPlaceables and Walkmeshes\nBaking a Level\nInterior Environment Basics\nTiles\nLevel Baking\nGeneral Lighting and Additional Considerations\nConclusion\n\n\nWHAT ARE EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR MAPS?\n\nAreas in the game are either exterior or interior maps. Exterior maps are made with a height map and allow \n\nfull flexibility in sculpting your terrain. Interior maps are made with the various tilesets and similar to how \n\nthe original NWN1 maps were created, though with greater flexibility on object placement.\n\nWithin any given module, you can use both exterior and interior areas. In the Sample Module, for \n\nexample, you begin in the exterior map outside of Pitney�s home and then can enter the interior map in his \n\nhome.\n\n\nEXTERIOR ENVIRONMENT BASICS\n\nThe first thing you need to do is create your first map. Create a new area by selecting 'File' 'New' 'Area'. \n\nThe New Area Wizard will come up.\n\nThe Area Tag is the name for the map so choose whatever is appropriate. Leave the Area Type on \n\nExterior. The size of the area can be adjusted after the map is made but start with a small map while \n\npracticing with the toolset.\n\nYou should see a plain green area in the main window. If you click �Grid� on the Toolbar it will show \n\nthe area grid with Black. Red, and White lines.\n\nThe black lines signify tile regions which affect textures, water, & grass limits. The tile regions will be \n\ncovered in more detail in the appropriate sections.\n\nThe White line indicates where the map border starts. Each exterior map has a 2 tile region border that \n\ncharacters can not enter. It�s there purely for decoration so characters won�t see the end of the world! This is \n\na place for hills, snaking roads, trees, etc. that add some beauty and detail to your maps but have no other \n\neffect to gameplay.\n\n\nToolbar\n\nThe toolbar has several handy functions for map making. Not all options will be covered but feel free to play \n\naround with the toggles to see what they do!\n\nGrid. This will toggle to grid which is handy for seeing the region grid and border grid.\nOcclusion Grid. This toggle shows the border area marked in red. Good for seeing where the border \n\narea starts without the grid visible. Remember characters can not enter the border area so this will help \n\nindicate the end of the walkable area.\nSurface Mesh. Shows the surface of the map that can be modified by the Terrain tools. Each line \n\nintersection can be adjusted in height. This will be covered in more detail in the terrain tools section.\nBaked. This is for level baking which will be covered in the Baking section.\nShadows, Water, Bloom, Fog, Sky. These toggle the various map features and are mostly for help \n\nduring map creation. The water toggle for example is handy when you want to paint terrain under a lake \n\nand need to temporarily see what you are doing! These toggles do not affect the terrain in any way in the \n\ngame engine.\nUse Area Far Plane. This is used in conjunction with the Fog settings (Farclip, FogEnd, FogStart) in \n\narea lighting. It will clip the view to where the game will stop drawing objects (Farclip). Useful for \n\ndetermining what players will see at different locations on a map.\nNormal Mapped Terrain. This toggle shows the terrain using either the basic ground textures or the \n\nnormal mapped ground textures. Normal mapped textures are similar to bump mapping in that they show \n\nshadow detail based on how the light hits them. For lower end systems normal mapped textures can be \n\nturned off so this toggle allows you to see what the terrain will look like on those systems.\nDay/Night. Allows you to select which of the 7 day/night settings to display your map in. Default is \n\nused for maps that have no day/night cycle. Lighting will be covered in more depth in the lighting \n\nsections.\n\n\nFilters: Show/Hide. The Show/Hide dropdown toggles the various map objects on and off. This is \n\nhandy for map making to remove various elements for ease of editing. As an example you might want to \n\nremove trees from the map so terrain painting would be easier. This is strictly for display and the objects \n\nnever actually are deleted.\nFilters: Selection. A very important dropdown that filters what objects you can interact with. When \n\nthere are many objects on a map but you are only adjusting lights for example you can turn off selection for \n\nall other types. That way you won�t accidentally move or delete something else. The editor has no undo \n\nfunction as of this writing so use the selection dropdown as a precaution.\nSnap. Used for doors so they will snap into position at the doorframe correctly.\nSelect Objects. The main mode for selecting the various objects on a map.\nPaint Objects. When you are painting objects this mode will be automatically selected. When you are \n\ndone painting objects hit ESC and you will return to Select Objects mode.\nSelect Terrain. Allows a tile to be selected. This is handy when working with water or checking texture \n\nusage.\nPaint Terrain. Mode for painting terrain, textures, water, or grass. This mode will be automatically \n\nselected when using those tools. The color of the brush will match the tool button color. If you wish to \n\nreturn to object selection, select �Select Objects�\nTiles. Used for Interior maps, see that section for more details.\n Drag Selection. Marquee selection toggle. If you wish to click-drag a bunch of objects you can use this \n\ntoggle option. It�s recommended to have this option off during normal use so you don�t accidentally select \n\nmore then one object.\n\n\nDay/Night Settings\n\nMaps can have a full day/night lighting cycle. This runs automatically. Some races like Drow get negatives \n\nduring daytime hours and there are ways to force \"always day\" or \"always night\" on a map. Or through \n\nscripts, you can start the clock at certain hours.\n\nThe day/night cycle is broken into 7 phases. If you look at the �Area Properties� for a map you�ll see a \n\nsection at the top labeled �Day/Night Cycle Stages� which allows full control of the lighting for each stage. \n\nThe details of this will not be covered in this document so it�s best to use one of the standard light settings \n\nfor your first maps.\n\nDefault is a special setting used on maps that have no Day/Night cycle. Mostly used for interior maps or \n\nthose that have a fixed time of day. Also generally used on maps made exclusively for cut scenes.\n\nRun. This allows you to see the full day/night cycle running in the editor.\nNormal Speed/Fast. Adjusts the speed of day/night cycle when �Run� is active. Useful to get a quick \n\nfeel of how the area looks at all times of the day.\n\n\nArea Properties\n\nThe Area Properties for a map are accessed by clicking your area in the \"Areas\" tab. The \"Properties\" \n\nwindow will display the area properties. This is where you can find the Day/Night Cycle Stages adjustments \n\nplus other settings useful for map making.\n\n\n\nAppearance.\na. Day/Night Cycle Stages - Opening this section allows control of the lighting for each cycle stage and \n\nthe default stage if no day/night cycle is turned off. There are many options here which allow almost infinite \n\ncontrol of your level lighting. When starting out it�s best to look at one of the standard lighting settings on \n\nsome of the sample maps to get a feel for what each control does.\nb. Sky Ring - Select a sky ring for each direction on a map. Examples such as mountains, hills, trees, & \n\ncities. These will appear the same color as fog color over the skybox on the horizon.\n\n\nEnvironment.\n\n\na. Day/Night Cycle True/False - If set to True the game will cycle through the 7 day/night phases. If set \n\nto False the game will light the map only on the Default lighting setting.\nb. Has Directional Light? True/False - The �SunMoon� setting (also known as the Directional Light) in \n\nthe Lighting stages will be turned on/off here. This should normally be True for exterior maps. For interior \n\nmaps it can be used for additional light to enhance the normal mapped textures but is optional. It does \n\ncount as a light when determining performance issues with number of lights.\n\nSee Point Lights for more details.\n\n\nc. Directional Light Casts Shadows True/False - The �SunMoon� directional light can have shadows \n\non/off. Normally exterior maps would be set to True. For interior maps that use directional light this would \n\nnormally be set to False. If Directional Lights are turned off then this setting has no function.\nd. Is Always Night? True/False - Normally used for exterior maps that have a fixed �Default� lighting. \n\nThis setting affects whether races like drow and duergar ever suffer their light sensitivity penalties.\n\nAdvanced Topic: Eternal Night\n\nTo make an area night all of the time, you have to do more than just set �IsAlwaysNight� to True. Make \n\nsure that the Day/Night Cycle is set to False and that the Default lighting setting (#7) is set to the nighttime \n\nconditions that you desire.\n Fog. Not currently functional. Leave at False.\nGeneral.\na. Interior True/False - For interior maps this should be set to true. Exterior maps should be set to \n\nfalse. Surprise!\nb. Natural - Natural environments like caves or forests should be set to true. Towns or villages would \n\nbe set to false.\nc. Underground - Caves or underground lairs should be set to True.\nd. Size � The map can be resized by selecting the button to the right of the \"Size\" listing. A popup will \n\nappear that allows the map to be increased or decreased in size from any of the compass directions. There \n\nare a few issues to be aware of when doing this. Any object that is Position Locked will not move when the \n\nmap shifts size. When the map changes size it sometimes needs to move objects to add the tiles and those \n\nlocked items will stay behind. Height locked items are not affected though.\n\nIf you are unsure which direction is North there�s a button (Show North) above the Area Viewer that \n\nplaces a North arrow in the center of the map. It�s a very good idea to save before doing a resize since there \n\nis no undo command.\n\nImport/Export Environment Settings\n\nAt the top of the Area Properties window are two buttons �Import Properties� & �Export Properties�. These \n\nsettings will allow you to import and export a group or individual day/night/default lighting settings. Useful \n\nif you like a map�s lighting and want to import it to your own map.\n\n\nUsing Environmental Tools \n\nNow it�s time to try your hand at painting an exterior map. There are four major tools available.\nTerrain is for adjusting the height of the surface mesh, adjusting the walkable areas, and tinting the \n\ntextures. The brush will match the color of the currently selected tool.\n\nTexturing is used to paint the actual terrain surface with grass, rock, dirt, cobblestones, etc. and has \n\ngreat versatility in brush control for nice mixing effects.\nGrass is used to paint various animated grass on the surface mesh and has control for mixing different grass \n\ntextures, blade size, size variation, and density.\nWater can be painted down at any height and has control of color, ripples, speed, & reflections.\n\n\nBrush\n\nAll four tools use the Brush to control painting size, brush pressure, height, & density.\n\nSize. This is the area of the brush that paints at the full pressure setting. Indicated by the inner circle of \n\nthe brush.\nOuter. The �drop-off� of the brush. Indicated by the outer circle of the brush. A large outer setting will \n\nmake more subtle hills when painting terrain and more blended textures during texture painting.\nPressure. In terrain building this will affect how extreme the sculpting of the terrain will be. For subtle \n\nchanges use a low setting under 20%. For texturing it controls how much the selected texture mixes with \n\nthe already painted textures. As an example if you have pressure set at 50% it will mix the selected texture \n\n50% with any other textures in the currently affected area.\nDensity. On grass painting this affects how much grass will paint in the current brush size. A high \n\nnumber will make a dense grass section.\nHeight. Controls what level the water will paint. Can be used with the Eyedropper button. More details \n\nare in the water section.\nS, M, L, G. These are predefined buttons for brush size.\n\n\nTerrain\n\nThe terrain tools allow sculpting terrain. You can paint hills, chasms, mountains, roads, etc. It�s the basic \n\ntool section for laying out your map.\n\nBrushes\nRaise/Lower. As the name suggests the brush will raise or lower the terrain in the selected brush area. \n\nUse the pressure setting to control the level of adjustment. Lower settings are suggested for fine \n\ncontrol.\nNoise. Adds a noise to painted area to break up flat sections of the map. Please note the tool does not \n\nwork across tile regions and can break sections. If this happens use the Smooth tool to clear out disjointed \n\ntile regions.\nSmooth. Smoothes out a section. Great for flattening out peaks or building terraced hills.\nWalk/No Walk. Used in conjunction with level baking to control character movement on a map. See \n\nLevel Baking for more details.\nFlatten. This control has �Height� instead of �Pressure� and will force the surface mesh to flatten at the \n\nset height. Used with the Eyedropper tool allows good control on maps you have much elevation \n\nchanges.\nColor. Used to tint the ground textures a certain color. Very useful in adding detail and modeling to \n\nexisting textures. Using a medium brown to darken ground around water or in crevasses along hills helps \n\nbreak up uniform patterns. Don�t underestimate this tool! Great to use after texturing is completed to \n\n�weather� a map.\n\n\nOther Options\n\n Flatten Under. By selecting a placeable object and pressing this button, the ground will flatten to the \n\nbase of that object. Good for use with buildings to match the ground to the floor.\nEyedropper. Used with Flatten to define a height level to flatten too. Very useful for making terraced \n\nhills or raising sections of the map quickly.\nColor. Used with the Color Brush to tint ground textures.\n\n\nTexturing\n\nThis tool is used to paint textures on the terrain. With the pressure option various textures can be layered to \n\nadd greater detail and variety.\n\nTexture painting has some limits so be sure to plan ahead when making your map. Usually it�s a good \n\nidea to pick a couple grass and dirt textures that you plan to use throughout the map. Leave at least one \n\ntexture space free for later additions. Even though you can use up to six textures per tile region don�t go too \n\nheavy on usage. The more unique textures a map has the more video card memory is needed.\n\n\nTexture Selection. This scrolling list shows all the textures included with NWN2 for use with ground \n\ntexturing. Select a texture on the list and the brush will paint it on the terrain at the size and pressure \n\npercentage.\nTexture Swapper. This option will swap the currently selected texture with another one you pick on the \n\npopup list. This will do this swap on the entire map so take care!\nFill Map. This will fill the entire map with the selected texture overwriting all current texture painting. \n\nThere is a confirmation box just to remind you since this is a very dangerous button!\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Selection\n\nThis list shows the currently used textures on a tile region. Each tile region (the black lines when �Grid� \n\nis on) can have a unique set of six textures. The position on the list is not an issue when painting from one \n\ntile to another. So if you have Dirt05 on two tiles in different positions on the list the editor will paint \n\ncorrectly across tile boundaries. You can individually change a texture on a tile by selecting that texture and \n\npicking a new one. If you want to do this for the entire map, use the Texture Swapper. If you already have \n\n6 textures on a tile the editor will not allow you to paint another one.\n\n\nGrass\n\nAnimated grass adds some nice movement and dimensionality to a map. It can be sprayed down like a \n\ntexture and has control on blade size and density.\n\nGrass Options.\na. Blade Size - Adjusts the size of the grass.\nb. Blade Size Variation - Adjusts the size variation so grass doesn�t have an even height. The higher the \n\nnumber the more extreme the variation will be.\n2. Grass.\na. Grass Selection - Pick a grass texture from the list. You can select multiple grass textures and they \n\nwill be mixed together when you paint.\nb. Paint - Paint grass with the brush.\nc. Erase - Erase grass with the brush.\n\n\nWater\n\nWater is painted down just like textures or grass but conforms to a flat height setting. Each tile region can \n\nhave its own water height so it�s wise to plan ahead on where you want water if multiple ponds or lakes will \n\nbe on\na map.\n\nWater.\na. Paint - Paint water down with the brush. The water will paint out to the Outer setting as there is no \n\nfalloff with water. While a tile is selected any changes to settings will affect all water on that tile only. If you \n\nwish to update the water on another tile just paint there and that water will conform to your new \n\nsettings.\nb. Erase - Erase water with the brush.\nc. Eyedropper - Use the button to set the height you would like the water to be painted at. Useful for \n\nfilling in a lake and finding the height just by selecting the wanted waterline.\nd. Import - Import previously saved water.\ne. Export - Export your favorite water settings for use on other maps.\nWater Settings.\na. Color - Set the color of the water!\nb. Ripple- Adjust the level of ripple. X & Y can be independently controlled.\nc. Smoothness - Adjust the choppiness of the water. From a violent sea to a frozen lake.\nd. Refraction settings - Adjust the reflection level of the water.\nWater Layers. Water has 3 layers that can be independently controlled. Allows great variety of effects. \n\nControls scroll direction, rate, and angle. Plus two textures are available.\n\n\nPlacing Objects\n\nNow that you are familiar with terrain, textures, grass, and water painting its time to place the various \n\nobjects on a map.\n\nThe Blueprints window is where you pick the various objects. Each type has its own tab. For the \n\npurposes of map making, we are most concerned with placeables, environment objects, trees, lights, placed \n\neffects, and prefabs. Some of these are discussed below.\n\n\nPlaceables\n\nPlaceables are premade objects like buildings, rocks, crates, etc. Just select a placeable from the list and \n\nstamp it down on the map. It will conform to the height of the terrain. If you select and drag you can move \n\nit around. Shift-right-click & Hold to rotate. Page Up/Down to change height. The Spacebar drops to the \n\nground plane.\n\n\nPlaceable Properties\n\nThere are many properties associated with a placeable. When a placeable is selected its properties will \n\nappear in the properties window. Not all will be covered in this document but below are ones more \n\nassociated with decorating your levels.\n\nTint. Many placeables have areas of the object that can be tinted a selected color. Up to three colors \n\ncan be changed depending on the object. The object name will indicate if the object has tinting \n\nenabled.\nScale. Change the X/Y/Z scale value of an object. Can be made large or small but take care not to \n\nincrease size too much since it will stretch the texture!\nStatic True/False (Static/Dynamic). Static objects (Static True) are default placeables. This means the \n\nobject takes up space but can not be interacted with. Dynamic objects (Static False) are chests, bookcases, \n\netc. that need to be interacted with. Chests etc. are covered in more detail in other documents.\nHeight/Position Lock. These settings control locking of an object. Height lock is useful when you have \n\nan object at the right height and don�t want it to move up/down when you adjust its position. Position lock \n\nis good for objects you don�t want to accidentally move later. Quick key for HeightLock is Z. Quick key for \n\nPosition Lock is L.\nStackable. Placing objects on tables can be a pain! But Stackable True solves it for you. Select an object \n\nand set Stackable to True. Drag that object to a table and the object will pop up to the top! Quick key is \n\nS.\nCast/Receive shadows. Shadow casting is processor intensive. For small objects or objects always \n\ninside a shadow you can set them to not cast shadows. By turning off receive shadows an object can appear \n\nto glow. Useful for arcane circles or torches.\n\n\nEnvironmental Objects\n\nEnvironmental objects are placeables converted to a less processor intensive format. Any placeable can be \n\nconverted. Select the placeable and use the �Convert� button at the top of the map screen. Also any \n\nenvironmental object can be converted back to a placeable.\n\nUse this for any object in the Border area or objects like rocks or buildings that the player can never get \n\nclose to. The engine does not calculate collision with them (character or camera) and does not cut the \n\nwalkmesh for them. They are useful to give the game fewer things to calculate when running your map. \n\nDecorative objects on tables are another good candidate for conversion.\n\n\nTrees\n\nTrees are objects created with the SpeedTree technology. They are designed specifically for high speed \n\nprocessing of natural looking trees and can be used in relatively great numbers without significant processor \n\nload.\n\nTrees can be adjusted in scale just like placeables and have standard height and position locking \n\noptions.\n\nEach tree has a random seed value that can be changed to adjust the look. So if two Oak trees are \n\nplaced with different seed values both will have different trucks, branches, and leaf positions. Play with the \n\nnumber and see what interesting trees you can make!\n\nThough the number of trees can be relatively great, the number of unique trees should be controlled. \n\nThe engine spends a fair amount of time calculating each unique tree so limiting the number is a good idea \n\nto keep your map running smoothly. At present it is recommended not to have more then five unique trees \n\nper map. Please note the same tree with two different seed values is considered two unique trees. But tree \n\nscaling is not considered a unique tree so using the same tree/seed value with different scales is an easy way \n\nto add variety.\n\n\nPoint Lights\n\nPoint lights are lights that can be placed on a map to add interest to a level. You can adjust range, color, \n\nintensity, shadow level, & flickering to each light.\n\nPlacing. Point lights are placed just like other objects. You will notice there is only one listed in the \n\nBlueprints. To keep track of your lights they can be named in Light Properties under �Localized Name.� If \n\nyou select multiple lights all can be named as a group. For example all the torch lights on a level could be \n\nnamed \"SmallTorch Light.\"\nColor. The color setting controls the color, reflected color, and intensity of the light.\na. Diffuse Color. This is the main setting for color and will light all objects within the range that \n\ncolor.\nb. Specular Color. This is the reflected color that bounces off shiny objects like armor, metal, and \n\nglossy objects.\nc. Intensity. Brightness of the light. Be careful of\ntoo high a setting since it can blow out the detail on close objects.\nd. Lerp Color. Used when Lerp is on. The color a lerp light changes to from the normal color \n\nsettings.\nRange. Range of the light. The red dot pattern globe shows the point the light no longer affects tiles, \n\nsurface mesh, and objects. This range is significant when dealing with lighting performance issues.\nShadow/Intensity. Lights can cast dynamic shadows on tiles, surface mesh, objects, & characters. The \n\nintensity is how dark that shadow will be. It�s best to keep the intensity close to your directional light \n\nshadow settings. Generally a setting of 0.5 or 0.6 is a good level. Turning off shadows helps with \n\nperformance and works well for lights that should act more like a glow such as magical effects in the \n\nenvironment.\nFlicker settings. Lights can be set to flicker so objects like torches and fireplaces look more natural. The \n\nFlicker Type controls the type of flicker effect. For example Jumpy will make the dynamic shadows move \n\nand works wonderfully with campfires and similar.\na. Flicker Rate. The speed of the flicker.\nb. Flicker Variance. The range of the flicker effect. High number will make the flicker more dramatic \n\nwhile a small number will make it more subtle.\nLerp settings. Lerp can set a second color for a pulsating light. Use it for a light you want to change \n\nbetween two colors. The Lerp Period controls the rate of the transition.\nPerformance Considerations. Point lights take a fair amount of processor time especially with shadows \n\nturned on. Use the range globe to see how many lights are affecting objects, surface mesh, and tiles. A \n\ngood rule of thumb is to have no more then three lights hitting any of these. Remember if you are using a \n\ndirectional light it should be considered when making your calculations.\n\n\nPlaced Effects\n\nPlaced effects are premade effects created with the Effects Editor. They include such things as fire, torches, \n\ncandles, smoke, etc. They are placed like any other object and have few controls to deal with. The yellow \n\n\"helper\" object allows you to select and move the effect around. You can turn this off separately in the \n\nShow/Hide filter on the Toolbar.\n\n\nPrefabs\n\nPrefabs are objects grouped together for easy placement. An example is a chandelier with candle placed \n\neffects. When you select the object group it moves and rotates as one item. You can Right-Click on the \n\nobject group and ungroup them if you prefer. If you want to select just one object in the group Ctrl+click. \n\nYou can manipulate that one item without breaking the group.\n\nMake your own prefabs by first selecting multiple objects and then right-clicking on one of the objects \n\nin that group. A popup allows you to group those items together. Give the group a unique name and you�re \n\ndone! If you can export that group to your Override folder, it will appear on your Prefabs blueprints \n\nwindow.\n\n\nLevel Baking\n\nLevel baking is the process of defining what is and is not walkable by the characters. The process has two \n\nbasic steps. The first step is to define your walkable region and the second step is to run the �Bake� \n\nprocedure which imbeds the walk data into the level. You can always modify the map walkable regions but \n\nyou must �rebake� the level after you do this before running the level in the game engine. If you try to run a \n\nlevel without baking, the characters will be stuck wherever they spawn!\n\nThe first step in getting a level ready for baking is defining where on the map a character is allowed to \n\nwalk. There are basically three levels of control for this procedure. Please note that border area tiles are \n\nALWAYS set to �No Walk�.\n\n\nWalkmesh Painting\n\nThe first level is the �Walk/No Walk� buttons under Terrain Tools. This is the lowest level control over where \n\na character can walk. Use the Brush tool to control size of brush similar to how it works for Terrain and \n\nTexturing. The black lines are non-walk areas, green lines walk areas, & yellow lines are the border between \n\nthem. The character in the image is standing in a legal walk area but the hill to his left is not crossable.\n\nIt is advisable to paint �No Walk� over large areas of non accessible areas since it will make the baking \n\nprocess much faster and generate a smaller area file.\n\n\nWalkmesh Cutter (Trigger)\n\nIn the �Triggers� tab of the Blueprints window there is a special trigger called a Walkmesh Cutter. This \n\nspecial trigger displays in blue and is used to more finely control where a character can walk. It is placed the \n\nsame way as a normal trigger (see trigger placement info elsewhere) and will define a no walk region when \n\nthe level is baked. It�s usually best to place these with the camera directly overhead. In the below image our \n\nhero now has a tighter exit off this slight rise. He can�t walk in the black area to the left and rear plus is \n\nblocked directly in front of him. And he can�t walk inside the area defined by the blue region.\n\n\nPlaceables and Walkmeshes\n\nPlaceables will cut out the walkmesh automatically during the bake process. This is especially useful for \n\nbuildings and walls which you can use to strategically block areas of the map. Many objects like bridges and \n\nraised platforms will cut the walkmesh so the character can walk on the bridge or platform instead of the \n\nterrain below it.\n\n\nBaking a Level\n\nOnce you have everything defined it�s time to run the bake procedure. Under �File� is an option called \n\n�Bake�. Running this can take some time on large maps so you will be greeted with a warning box just to be \n\nsure you really want to do it.\n\nOnce you run the baking procedure you can check it to be sure everything is defined as you planned. \n\nOn the toolbar turn on toggles �Surface Mesh� and �Baked�. In the image below the Walkmesh cutter has cut \n\nout the area defined by the blue lines. The rock placeable cut itself out automatically! Our character has \n\nmuch less space to move around now. Note there�s a little sliver of walkable region between the cutter and \n\nrock placeable but since each creature in the game has a defined width he shouldn�t be able to move inside \n\nthere.\n\nIf you want to make changes to a walkmesh first turn off the \"Baked\" toggle button and make any \n\nadjustments you want. You can change walkmesh cutters, placeable locations, & terrain walkmesh painting. \n\nBut before you run your level in the game make sure to �rebake� the level! The Bake toggle will always show \n\nthe current terrain bake so by turning it on and off will show the changes that you made.\n\n\nAdvanced Topic: Issues with too many objects\n\nSometimes with densely packed placeables a tile region can get overloaded and fail the bake process. \n\nYou�ll see that by a tile that is completely unwalkable. There are two ways to fix this. Delete and/or move \n\nsome placeables and try baking again. Or try converting some placeables to �Environmental Objects� (see \n\nplaceables section) and surrounding by a Walkmesh Cutter. Walkmesh Cutters tend to be simpler for the \n\nengine to process a walkmesh from. The below example shows two stools and a campfire that were \n\nconverted to environmental objects and surrounded by a cutter.\n\nThis is a simple example and normally the engine would not have an issue with a simple cut like this.\n\n\nINTERIOR ENVIRONMENT BASICS\n\nInterior maps are created using tilesets similar to the original NWN1. There is no surface mesh painting or \n\ntexturing needed since you can build everything from the included tilesets. It generally takes less time to \n\nmake a good interior than it does to make a good exterior.\n\nA new area is created just like with an exterior map.\n\nCreate a new area by selecting 'File' 'New' 'Area.' The New Area Wizard will open up.\n\nThe Area Tag is the name for the map so choose whatever is appropriate. Switch the Area Type to Interior \n\n(terrain). The size of the area can be adjusted after the map is made but start with a small map while \n\npracticing with the toolset.\n\n\nTiles\n\nThe Tiles Panel displays the seven tilesets available. By opening up each subsection it will show the available \n\ntiles for that set. Most tilesets also have �Meta Tiles� that are special larger pieces used either for specific \n\nmain campaign maps or for added flexibility. The �Caves� tileset for example has many unusual meta tile \n\npieces to help make a cave look more natural.\n\nPlacing tiles is as easy as selecting the desired type and clicking it down on the map area. To make \n\nmapping easier turn on �Occlusion Grid� on the Toolbar. This will show the tile boundaries and map \n\nedges.\n\nRotating tiles. To rotate a tile use the Left/Right Arrow keys.\nTypes. There are many types of tiles and the thumbnail image will give you an idea what the tile is. A \n\nblue line means a wall. Red is a door position. A cyan dot is a corner. Arrows indicate a staircase up or \n\ndown.\nTile Variations. Some tile pieces have variations you can choose. Frequently a straight wall will have \n\nversions with pillars, windows, damage, etc. To cycle through the variations use the Up/Down Arrow \n\nkeys.\nMixing tilesets. Some tilesets can be mixed such as the Caves and Mines. Doorways will sometimes line \n\nup depending on tileset or a special Meta Tile will be available to connect them. Check the sets and \n\nexperiment to find what you can connect!\nBorder considerations. When placing tiles make sure to leave one tile section around the perimeter of \n\nthe map. Otherwise the backside of a tile will be visible ingame.\nSelecting Tiles. On the Toolbar you will note the �Tiles� button is on when placing tiles. You can select \n\nmultiple tiles by holding the Shift key down. This is useful when tinting (explained below.) When you want \n\nto work with objects make sure to switch to \"Select Objects.\"\nDeleting Tiles. Just select a tile and press the Delete Key. You can use the Shift Key to select multiple \n\ntiles first. If you have any objects on that tile they will stay behind but you won�t be able to see them unless \n\nyou place another tile down. All deleted tiles are replaced with a \"Roof\" tile.\nTile Tinting. Most tilesets can be tinted. There are separate controls for Walls and Floors. Select a tile \n\nor group of tiles and check the Tile Properties window. Under Appearance you can select the colors you \n\nwant to change. Some tilesets have tinting on the roof pieces. These are not separately tinted but use the \n\nWall colors.\n\n\nLevel Baking\n\nLevel baking needs to be done before a map is completed just like exterior maps. Tilesets are predefined for \n\nbaking. The walls and doorways are already setup to bake properly. Your main consideration will be \n\nplaceables and other objects. Remember if a tile is overly populated with objects it can fail to bake properly. \n\nIf this happens that tile will not be walkable and you will either have to remove some objects or convert \n\nsome to environmental objects and use walkmesh cutters. See the Level Baking section for more info.\n\n\nGeneral Lighting and Additional Considerations\n\nInterior maps are lit just like exterior maps but no exterior elements like sky, moon, or sun are visible. \n\nInterior maps should be set to �Day/Night Cycle: False� in the Area Properties window. They will only use \n\nthe �Default� light setting.\n\nDirectional light considerations. Normally you will want to have \"Directional Light Casts Shadows: \n\nFalse\" & \"Is Always Night?: False\" set. The directional light can be set to True or False. The directional light \n\n(SunMoon setting under Default) can help punch up the Normal mapping on the walls and floor. But when \n\ncalculating number of lights for performance issues you must count it as another light resource.\nPoint Light considerations. Point lights are extremely important for interiors to help enhance the \n\nlighting of your map. They should be used for torches, candles, fireplace objects, etc. and help add \n\ninteresting shadows and color to an area. But they do require a fair amount of processor time so limiting the \n\nnumber in an area is important. Usually a good rule of thumb is no more then 3 lights hitting any tile or \n\nobject at a time. Note that if you have Directional Lighting set to True this will count as another light.\nTerrain/Texturing/Grass. These terrain tools are not used in interiors.\nWater. Water can be used in interiors. For example, the cave set has a pool tile that is excellent as a \n\nplace to put water. You can even use water to simulate a marble floor!\nPlaceables. Placeables and environmental objects work as they do for exterior maps.\nTrees. Even trees can be placed inside. Try changing the scale and turning a tree into a house \n\nplant!\nPlaced Effects. Add torch fires, candles, etc. to your lighting objects for added detail.\nPrefabs. Many of the prefabs are made specifically for interior use. Some handy ones are the \n\nchandeliers with candle flames already placed!\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Neverwinter Nights 2 toolset has extremely powerful capabilities for building and creating beautiful \n\nworlds and environments. It can take considerable experience to create your own masterpieces, but \n\ndedicated world makers will find the end results to be well worth the effort. Now that you�ve completed this \n\nHowTo, you should know:\n\nThe differences between exterior and interior maps.\n How to sculpt, texture, and decorate terrain.\nHow to bake levels so that they are ready to be played in the game.\nHow to place objects such as trees and lights.\nHow to utilize tiles to quickly make interior maps.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"11":{"Name":"NWN2 TOOLSET BETA TEST FAQ","Author":"Obsidian","Submitted":20061004,"Updated":20061004,"Category":"Toolset","Description":"NWN2 TOOLSET BETA TEST FAQ\n\n\nThis document contains answers to some toolset questions that have arisen through the development of \n\nNWN2.

I�m having trouble getting the toolset to run.\n\nMake sure you have the .NET Framework version 1.1 installed. It's available at\n\nClick Here\nMake sure you have DirectX 9.0c installed. Click Here\n\n\nHow do I play my module in the game?\n\nFor the toolset beta test, you must use one of the test modules or else name your module �Custom� in order \n\nto play it in the game. The retail version of NWN2 will not have this restriction.\n\n\nHow do I move the camera?\n\nControl - middle-click rotates the camera. The mousewheel moves the camera forward and backwards.\n\n\nHow do I move objects?\n\nMake sure that you're in \"select objects\" mode. Pick the objects you want to move, and then left-drag \n\nselected objects to move them around. To rotate them, you can press shift - right - click. Alt - right - click \n\nmoves the selection up or down.\n\n\nCan I port my NWN1 content into NWN2?\n\nYes and no. Unfortunately, because of the many technological improvements made to the NWN2, we were \n\nunable to support NWN1 areas themselves.\n\nHowever, it was a priority of ours to support the NWN1 mod efforts as much as possible and we thus \n\nmade the toolset backwards compatible in many ways. You can open up a NWN1 module with the NWN2 \n\ntoolset. All of your conversations and scripts will be available. You can then use the NWN2 toolset to export \n\nthis work and then import it into your new NWN2 creation.\n\nNote that more recent NWN1 scripts that have been released will not be in the NWN2 toolset. You will \n\nneed to import these scripts if your module makes use of them. On the other hand, the NWN2 toolset comes \n\nwith many new scripts that you�ll be able to use.\n\n\nHow do I restore the toolset configuration to its default settings?\n\nPreferences for the toolset are stored in C: \\Documents and Settings \\ \\Local Settings \n\n\\Application Data \\NWN2 Toolset\n\nIf you renamed or delete that folder, your settings will return to their defaults.\n\n\nHow do I enable/disable the Autosave feature?\n\nUnder 'View' Options, you will find autosave settings.\n\n\nWhat are 2da files and where are they?\n\nThe 2da files in the located in \\Data \\2da.zip\nYou can place a 2da in the directory \\Override\n\nThis will override the corresponding 2da in the zip file when playing the game.\n\n2da stands for \"2 dimensional array\". 2da files can be edited in any text editor. They are \"whitespace\" \n\ndelimited, not comma delimited, so care should be taken when attempting to edit w/ Excel.\n\nFor specific technical information on the file format of 2da files, see the official documentation located here:\n\nClick Here\n\nInformation on all NWN file formats available here:\n\nBioware Developers\n\n\n\nWhat is the �Override� directory for?\n\nAny data that is stored in the override directory takes precedence over normal game data. So, for example, \n\nif you place a new spells.2da into the Override directory, it will be used for various spell data � instead of \n\nthe official spells.2da. The Override directory is great for testing out changes as you can easily revert to the \n\nofficial data just by deleting its contents.\n\nIf you make changes and are not seeing results, it may be because there is a file in the Override \n\ndirectory that is trumping your changes. You should clean out your Override directory periodically.\n\n\nHow do I manipulate static cameras?\n\nHolding down ALT while moving them will raise/lower them.\n\nShift-right-drag will spin/yaw them (same as all other objects).\n\nHolding down ALT+SHIFT and right-dragging will pitch the camera up and down.\n\nHolding down CTRL+SHIFT and right-dragging will roll the camera.\n\n\nSCRIPTING\n\nHow do I get something to happen after the Party has killed certain creatures?\n\nSet a local string variable called �DeathScript� on the creature whose death you want to cause a script to \n\nfire. (The standard on death script has been modified to help accommodate this.)\n\nWhen the creature dies, this script will be called from that creature�s normal OnDeath script. So say you \n\nwant a trigger to spawn in 2 baddies that will run to the player, and will have a script �12_b_gith_inn_de� \n\nthat executes when they die.\n\nYou could do the following in the trigger�s\n\nNWScript\n\nYou do not need to modify these creatures� standard OnDeath scripts in order to get this script to work.\n\nTypically, you will want the death script to run when a group of creatures is killed. The way to do this is \n\nkeep track of the number of creatures killed. If that number equals the number of creatures in the group, \n\nthen you execute your special �group is dead� code.\n\nNWScript\n\nSo in the above example, you would have set each critter in the group�s DeathScript variable to each \n\nrun the above script on death. The 5th time that script is triggered, whatever code you have within that �if� \n\nstatement will be executed � all 5 critters are dead.\n\nNote: If you need to get the PC in the death script, the best way in this situation is:\n\nNWScript\n\nHow do I make a trigger only occur for a PC and only once?\n\nThere are functions in ginc_misc that make this a little easier. What you want to do is put your conditions at \n\nthe top that will exit out of the trigger. At the bottom, be sure to mark your trigger as having completed. \n\nThe following code can be used as a template:\n\nNWScript\n\nHow do I force a character into the party?\n\nAt this point in time we don�t have a GUI for this, and so it has to be done within a conversation. You�ll need \n\nto use three main global scripts:\n\ngc_max_companion() is a conditional that you would apply to a node to see whether the party has \n\nalready reached the maximum number of companions, and hence would require forcing a companion out of \n\nthe party in order to force in a different companion.\n\nga_replace_comp(string sCompToRemove, string sCompToAdd) is an action that will replace the \n\ncompanion with tag sCompToRemove with the companion with that sCompToAdd. Don�t forget that CNPC \n\ntags are all lowercase now.\n\ngc_comp_remove(string sCompanion) checks whether it�s okay to remove the companion with tag \n\nsCompanion from the party. If they�re not in the party, or if they have an integer variable on them �bForced� \n\nset to TRUE, then this function will return FALSE � the player shouldn�t have the option to remove them.\n\nAs long as you want the character to be forced into the party, they should have a local int on them \n\n�bForced� set to TRUE. Once they�re no longer required, reset it to FALSE.\n\nSo, as an example, say that the maximal number of companions was 2, and that the PC already has \n\nNeeshka and Grobnar in his party, but Khelgar needs to be forced in because the PC has just entered an area \n\nthat�s important for Khelgar�s development. You�d just make sure that a conversation initiates upon entering \n\nthat area with Khelgar, and you need the end of that conversation to work like this:\n\n(khelgar) \"Blah blah I�m joining your party and you have to deal with it because I�m a racially \n\nstereotypical stubborn dwarf.\"\n\n->if AND gc_max_companion()\nAND gc_comp_remove(neeshka) �[Remove Neeshka from the party]�\n->ga_replace_comp(neeshka, khelgar)\n\n->if AND gc_max_companion()\nAND gc_comp_remove(grobnar) �[Remove Grobnar from the party]�\n->ga_replace_comp(grobnar, khelgar)\n\n->else �[END DIALOGUE]� ga_add_companion(khelgar)\n\n(The �if� and �else� above are just there to denote how the conditional should flow.)\n\nAs a shortcut, you may want to have a blue node with no text that checks gc_max_companion, and \n\nthen blue nodes beneath that that node check gc_comp_remove for each companion � since you�ve \n\nguaranteed that each of those nodes has passed the gc_max_companion check, you don�t have to make that \n\ncheck again at every node.\n\nYou may also need another action to get rid of the removed CNPC and send them to the Sunken Flagon \n\nor wherever. ga_force_exit() comes to mind. That was left out of ga_replace_comp() to allow for special \n\ncases where you wouldn�t want removed players to exit.\n\n\nMy encounter creatures aren�t wondering around. How can I fix this?\n\nMake sure your spawn script has the following:\n\nNWScript\n\nHow do I make a group run a custom script On Death?\n\nThe group on death scripts utilizes nw_c2_default7's alternate death script execution. (e.g. if an alternate \n\n\"DeathScript\" is specified, execute it.)\n\nSet up the death script execution for the group, like so:\nGroupSetLocalString (sGroupName, \"DeathScript\", \"\");\n\nThe script naming convention is: NWScript\n\nto indicate it is a group death script\n\nFor example:\n\n35_g_death_trig_enc\n\nNow, as each member of your group dies, it will call the specified script.\n\nNext, create the group death script. Use the template \"gg_death_XXX\" in the scripttemplates directory in \n\nsource safe. It will look something like this: NWScript\n\nSimply add your code in the if statement above.\n\n\nHow is the faction editor spreadsheet read?\n\nIt should be read the same as in the faction editor from the original toolset. Each row represents a faction's \n\nfeelings about the other faction. In other words, faction ROW's rating of faction COLUMN is located in \n\n[ROW, COLUMN]. In the example below, CellarDwellers are hostile to Police (rating 10), but Police rate \n\nCellarDwellers as neutral (40).\n\n\n# CellarDwellers Police\nCellarDwellers 50 10\nPolice 40 50\n\n\n\nTERRAIN USER INTERFACE QUESTIONS\n\nWhat Does the Inner/Outer Circle do?\n\nThe two circles represent the visual mouse brush interface for terrain modification. The two circles will \n\nfollow the contours of the terrain when you are in Paint Terrain Mode. The Inner Circle receives the full \n\npower of the value slider, and the Outer Circle is the feather at which the effect will drop off to zero. If the \n\nouter circle is less or equal to the radius of the inner circle, there will be no feathering.\n\n\nWhat does \"Value\" do?\n\nValue controls the strength of the brush. The meaning of the value control might change depending on what \n\nelevation control you are using. For example, valid values for raising and lowering terrain are in between 0 \n\nand 1.0, but values for terrain flattening can of any range.\n\n\nWhat are all the elevation buttons for?\n\nR - Raise - raises the terrain by the value amount.\nL - Lower - lowers the terrain by the value amount.\nF - Flatten - flattens out the terrain to the value amount.\nS - Smooth - smooths out the terrain (works best with values in the .1-.4 range).\nN - Noise - makes the terrain bumpy/rock like. (works best with values in the .8-1.0 range).\nFU - Flatten Under Selected - flattens out the terrain below the selected object. Good for making \n\nground under buildings flat.\n\n\nVISUAL EFFECTS EDITOR\n\nHow do I launch the visual effects editor plugin?\n\nIt should be located under the Plugins menu in the toolset, titled VFX Editor.\n\n\nHow does the visual effects system work?\n\nVisual effects are composed of effect files, which are individual components of an effect (a particle system, a \n\ntrail, a billboard, etc.), and SEF files, which point to the effect files and organize them into a more complex \n\nvisual effect.\n\n\nHow do I use the visual effects editor?\n\nFirst, create the individual effects. Under File->New, you will see the different effect types. Select one and \n\nthen, in the editor that opens, modify its properties until you achieve the results you desire. Then, create a \n\nnew SEF file, and press the Add Event button on the toolbar to select a type of event to add.\n\nThe event will appear in the tree list in the upper-left corner of the window. By selecting the event, you \n\ncan then change the DefinitionFile property, which determines the individual effect file that the event \n\nreferences. Select the effect you created earlier, and then press Play on the toolbar to see your visual effect \n\nin action.\n\nMake sure to save your work when you are done.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"12":{"Name":"Light Shines Through Solid Walls!","Author":"Obsidian","Submitted":20061004,"Updated":20061004,"Category":"Toolset","Description":"Light shines through solid walls, help!\n\nGuys... relax.

I expect to add to these over time.\nI have added a token trader for therealkid, but it is not a generic thing and I may remove it latter.\nThe download includes a demo module and an .erf file with the scripts and suporting items, as well as these instructions.\nThe .erf comprises:\n\nstarter_kill_pc.nss - Slays the PC to test the respawn.\nstarter_on_player_respawn.nss - Sample respawn script.\nstarter_pc_first_time.nss - Sets the starting golg and xp for PCs.\nstarter_csf_component (placeable) - Links the sample scripts to events via the Common Scripting Framework.\nstarter_wp_respawn (waypoint) - Marks the respawn location.\n\nAll scripts begin with 'starter_' and all items are categorized under 'starter'.\nInstallation\nYou can just load the provided module and talk to Aldanon. He will tell you how to test out the scripts. Open the module in the Toolset to have a look at them. Or you can import the erf file into your own module.\nThis module uses the Common Scripting Framework. This is a tool to help you add scripted systems made by other module builders without having to merge their starting event scripts manually. \nIf you have CSF:\n\nImport the .erf.\nPlace the 'Placeable->starter->CSF Component - Starter Scripts' in an inaccessible area.\nPlace the 'Waypoint->starter->Respawn Waypoint' where you want PCs to respawn (e.g. a temple).\n\nIf you don'thave CSF:\n\nImport the .erf.\nPlace the 'Waypoint->starter->Respawn Waypoint' where you want PCs to respawn (e.g. a temple).\nRename the script 'starter_on_player_respawn' to 'gui_death_respawn_self'.\nOpen your starting area. Go to properties and set the script 'OnClientEnter' to 'starter_pc_first_time'.\n\nChangelog\n\n 1.01 - Added the Token Trader for therealkid as discussed the forum.\n 1.00 - Respawn and starting gold/xp scripts.\n\nMaintained by Daniel Vale aka GreenDragon5000 and Charlie Vale.\n\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"53":{"Name":"Gu�a del world map plugin.","Author":"Gonar","Submitted":20070127,"Updated":20070128,"Category":"Toolset","Forum Thread":"Link","Link":"Link","Short Description":"Gu�a de uso del world map plugin.","Description":"Gu�a en castellano ilustrada sobre el uso del plugin oficial World map editor.\n\nContenido del archivo rar.\n\nLa gu�a en formato pdf.\n\nLos archivos de modulo y campa�a resueltos, que se usan en la gu�a a modo de ejercicio.\n","Rating":9.78,"Votes":11,"Awards":[]},"54":{"Name":"Sunjammer's World Map Guide","Author":"Sunjammer","Submitted":20070201,"Updated":20100518,"Category":"Toolset","Short Description":"A guide to the NWN2 World Map System by Sunjammer","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Sunjammer's World Map Guide\n05 Jul 2007\nv1.01\n\nThe NWN2 World Map System provides an exciting new interface for representing long distance travel in your campaign.

This document will describe various methods and highlig","Description":" \n Deployment and Installation of Custom Content in NWN2 \n \n\nThere are several ways to get custom content into the game, but not all are \n equal. Some have advantages over others and some can actually break your game \n install making you unable to patch your game. This document will describe various \n methods and highlight best practices.\nInformation valid for minimum game version: 1.04. \n \nA note about NWN2 resource handling:\nThe game manages resources from a number of possible repositories. These repositories \n include the .zip archives in the \\data folder, resources contained in the .mod \n file itself, resources placed in the Override folder, resources placed in a \n campaign folder and resources contained in a hakpak associated to the module.\nThe game reads these resources in using a hierarchical methodology. This means \n that resource repositories are placed in a \"pecking order\", so to \n speak. In short, each repository has a priority status. What this means is that \n the same piece of content placed in the repositories will be overridden by the \n content in the highest priority repository. So, placing a placeables.2da file \n into the Override directory will mean that that particular 2da is now the one \n the game will use instead of the placeables.2da contained in the 2da.zip under \n the C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Data folder. The Override \n folder is higher up the pecking order than the .zip archives in the \\data folder.\nThis is how we get content into the game without altering the base content \n -- we place our content into a repository that has a higher priority than the \n default resources. We can add new content this way and overwrite base content \n all without ever messing with the default game resources. \n \nAdding content to the .zip archives in the \\data folder:\nOkay, this is a big no-no. These archives are typically located under C:\\Program \n Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Data and contain most of the data the game \n uses. Model files, texture files, 2da files and lots of other types reside in \n these .zip archives. The thing to remember about these files is that they are \n Obsidian's files. They are Obsidian's to patch and maintain. And this means \n that if you alter them in the slightest you can cause the patch process to fail. \n The patch process relies upon comparing the file on your harddrive to a signature \n the patch has for that file. Altering the file can and will alter the signature \n which means the patcher won't know what to do with the file since it is different \n than the file it has the instructions for patching. There is no reason or need \n to alter these archives in any way. So, don't do it and don't tell anyone \n else to do it.\n \nAdding content to the Override directory:\nThis method is less harmful than altering the .zip archives; however, it is \n not ideal. The Override directory is typically located at C:\\Documents and \n Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\override. It \n should be noted that another Override directory can be found at C:\\Program \n Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override but you should leave anything \n under the install directory unaltered. Anything found in the install directory \n should be able to be mirrored in the C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My \n Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\ directory structure. The reasons for only \n adding content to the My Documents version of the directories are: \n\n Working under a single path is easier.\n You don't have to worry about resources conflicting between the two directory \n paths.\n Uninstalling the game will not uninstall any custom content you have installed.\n\nAdding content to the Override directory is not ideal because you are dealing \n with loose files. Managing masses of loose files can be cumbersome and time \n consuming when you get a fair number of them. Also, loose files run the risk \n of being overwritten when you place more content into the directory. If you \n have several custom content packages you wish to install, then it becomes possible \n for one package to overwrite some of the content of another package and this \n will break the functionality of some of the content or even core game functionality. \n Also, files added to the Override directory are active for any and all game \n sessions the user launches. That is, they are active playing the Official Campaign, \n they are active for any modules you download and play as well as any online \n sessions you play. While this may be desirable in some situations, it also means \n that you could be creating conflicts with other custom content in use by the \n module or online world you are playing. \n \nAdding content to the Campaign directory:\nThis is something I don't have any real experience with. Basically, it is a \n module specific Override folder. I believe the main advantage is that a campaign \n can carry over journal entries between modules that share the same campaign \n folder. In terms of adding custom content, I would still recommend a hakpak \n solution for integration of custom content into a campaign.\n \nAdding content using a hakpak:\nThis is the preferred method of custom content distribution. A hakpak is simply \n an archive file (like a .zip, but not compressed) which holds numerous other \n files. hakpaks are placed in the C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My \n Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak folder. Unlike the Override directory \n method, hakpaks are only in effect for the module they are associated to. This \n means they will not alter any game sessions where the module being played doesn't \n have the hakpak attached to it. This makes hakpaks much more of a targeted approach \n to custom content deployment; whereas, the override method is much more of a \n blunt instrument approach. \nThis method also avoids the possibility of overwriting some of the files between \n custom content packages. Since each hakpak contains all of the files for the \n custom content package, there is no possibility of one hakpak overwriting the \n contents of another. For example, you could have three custom content packages \n for three different modules you downloaded with each hakpak containing a placeables.2da. \n Using the Override method you will overwrite the placeables.2da twice when you \n unpack the 2nd and 3rd custom content package into the Override -- this will \n break functionality of package one and package two. Using the hakpak method \n you will have three individual hakpaks sitting in your \\hak folder and each \n one will only become active when you launch a module that has the hakpak associated \n to it. Otherwise, the haks sit innocently in the \\hak folder not interfering \n with each other or the base game install. \nCreating and adding hakpaks: \nA lot of misinformation seems to be floating about regarding hakpaks, so I'll \n attempt to explain the basics as clearly as possible. As stated above, a hakpak, \n at its simplest, is just an archive file. NWN2 did not ship with a tool to let \n us create hakpaks, but we do have tools available to let us do this thanks \n to the community. NWN2 style hakpaks are slightly different from NWN1 style \n hakpaks -- NWN2 uses an updated version of the file format (v1.1 as opposed \n to NWN1 v1.0). This means that the hak editor for NWN1 will not give us the \n full functionality needed for creating NWN2 hakpaks (for example, it will not \n accept any of the new file formats introduced in NWN2 [.mdb, .bbx, .pfx, etc.]). \n\nSo, we need a tool to do the job for us. ERFinder \n by Tanita is the tool I have been using and it works very well. \n There is also another tool I'm aware of called Encapsulated \n Resource File Editor by Ranmanu, but I haven't experimented with \n it too much. The process for using these tools is relatively straightforward: \n you add your custom content files through the program interface and then save \n as a .hak giving it a file name. Make sure the hak is in the C:\\Documents \n and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak folder. \n\nNow, we have our hakpak, but a hakpak is not active unless it is associated \n to a module. The process of associating a hakpak to a module is done through \n the toolset. Open your mod in the toolset and go to View --> Module Properties. \n In the properties tab you will see a listing for hakpaks. Click on it. A new \n window will open. Click the Add button and a new entry will appear on the top \n right. Click where it says FileName, navigate to your C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My \n Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak folder and choose your hakpak. Press \n OK, save your module and you're done. Whatever the hak adds or changes should \n now be active in the toolset for that module as well as active in-game when \n that module is played. \n \nMultiple hakpaks: \nMultiple hakpaks can be attached to a single module. They are added in the \n same way as described above. As you add hakpaks you will see the list on the \n top left of the hakpak interface panel grow. As mentioned above, hakpaks are \n safer than loose files because you can never run the risk of overwriting a file \n when installing multiple packages. However, this doesn't mean you don't need \n to deal with resource conflicts at all. If you have two or more hakpaks that \n contain the same resource, then you will have a resource conflict. The way this \n is dealt with is the same as I described above regarding resource repositories \n -- hakpaks are subject to a hierarchical priority system. The priority is determined \n by the hakpak's position in the hak list displayed on the hakpak interface panel. \n You will notice that haks are numbered from 0 onwards. * Currently, the \n toolset will take the last hakpak listed as the highest priority hak on the \n list. If you had three haks numbered 0, 1 and 2, then the hakpak listed as number \n 2 would be the highest priority. So, if hakpak number 2 had the same resource \n as hakpak number 0 or hakpak number 1, then the resource from hakpak number \n 2 would be the one used. \nThe way resource conflicts between haks are resolved is through the creation \n of a \"master\" or \"control\" hakpak and placing it in the \n highest priority position. The idea here is to take your conflicting resources, \n merge them and then place them in a hakpak. So, for example, we have two hakpaks that both contain a placeables.2da. The first hakpak adds a placeable \n at line 2000 of the 2da and the second hakpak adds a placeable at line 2100. \n We would create a placeables.2da where we copy line 2000 from the first hakpak's placeables.2da and a paste it in at line 2000 and then copy in line 2100 \n from the second placeables.2da. This way we have a single placeables.2da that \n contains the entries from both hakpaks (Note: I'm omitting some steps for the \n merging of 2da's [i.e. padding] as the subject is beyond the scope of this document). \n We then place that new placeables.2da in our control hak and set that hak in \n our hak list so it has priority over hak one and two.\n \nHakpak Issues:\n* Note: The priority system is broken as of v1.04. The toolset should be taking \n hakpak number 0 as the highest priority. This is the way the game engine reads \n it, so when you want to run your module you need to move your haks to the opposite \n order. \n\nSometimes you will find a resource instance or resource type that will not \n function from a hakpak. This list is shrinking as Obsidian has been correcting \n these issues. If you find something that does not work from a hakpak let Obsidian \n know -- they can't fix it if they don't know about it. It should be said that \n I have added tiles, placeables, base items, visual effects, GUI .xml files, \n .dds textures and more all through the hakpak system alone. So, while you may \n find some items that won't function at this time, the problem is not nearly \n as wide spread as I have seen some declare it to be. For example, I have seen \n \"2da's do not work from hakpaks\". This is plainly incorrect. \n I believe nwn2_deities.2da is not working from a hakpak right now, but that \n is far from saying no 2da works from a hakpak. Also, some items that won't work \n from a hakpak also don't work from the Override. This is likely because those \n resources are from specialized folders like the UI folder. Obsidian also seems \n to be working on adding this content to be supported through the hak system \n (i.e. the UI .xml files work from haks). \nHaks currently aren't loaded until after a player creates a character. This \n means any changes to the character creation process you make via a hakpak aren't \n in effect until it's too late. Obsidian has stated they will be fixing this \n so that all content will be loaded before the player hits the character creation \n screen.\n \nFAQ: \nQ: I'm just a player. What do I do with haks?\nA: Place them in your C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My \n Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak folder. When you downloaded the hak it \n probably came in a .zip or .rar file -- you need to unpack it and place the \n file(s) with a .hak extension in the folder. You don't need the .rar or .zip \n in that folder. \nQ: I'm a player and a builder. What do I do with haks?\nA: Place them in your C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My \n Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak folder. When you downloaded the hak it \n probably came in a .zip or .rar file -- you need to unpack it and place the \n file(s) with a .hak extension in the folder. You don't need the .rar or .zip \n in that folder.\nQ: I'm a player, a builder and a custom content developer. What do I \n do with haks and how should I develop content?\nA: Place haks in your C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My \n Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak folder. When you downloaded the hak it \n probably came in a .zip or .rar file -- you need to unpack it and place the \n file(s) with a .hak extension in the folder. You don't need the .rar or .zip \n in that folder. You can use the Override directory for developing your custom \n content as it easier to add/remove files from it than updating a hakpak numerous \n times as you make changes. Note that if a file is in a hakpak associated to \n a module, then adding that same file to the Override will do nothing for that \n module as hakpaks take priority over the Override folder. Best practice is to \n develop your content first using the Override directory and a test module with \n no haks associated. Then, when your project is complete, package the files from \n the Override into a hakpak, associate the hakpak to your test or demo module \n and remove the files from the Override. When everything checks out (play your \n demo module, open the module in the toolset to see that your content is present, \n etc.), package your hak into a .rar or .zip file along with a demo module to \n showcase your work, if you wish. You should provide a version number for your \n content, a readme file and also ensure your hakpak has a unique name or prefix \n (to avoid conflicts with other hak creators). For example, I preface my hak \n names with \"Heed_\". Your initials or anything else fairly unique to \n yourself should do. \n \n\n\nEnjoy!\nHeed.

This was written during Patch 1.05 and will be updated should \n any future patchs alter anything.\n\n Connecting to a PW/Multiplayer Server\n\n 1. Launch Neverwinter Nights 2\n 2. On the main menu, choose Multiplayer\n 3. If you have not logged in before, choose \"Create New Account\" \n and fill out the form. The \"Bioware Community Name\" that you choose \n will also create an account for you in the NWN2 forums. Click OK when done.\n 4. If you have already created an account, enter your username and password. \n Click \"Sign In\" when done.\n 5. Click \"Join Internet Game\"\n 6. Browse through the servers by choosing different Game Types. Make \n sure to wait a second or two after you choose a different game type, so that \n the list has time to load.\n 7. Click on a server that interests you. You can sort by any field listed \n by clicking on its name. For example, to sort by # of players online, click \n \"Players\" up top.\n 8. Download the required files for the server that interests you. Details \n on how to do this are below.\n 9. Click \"Connect\"\n 10. Make your character, and start playing!\n\n Downloading Required Files\nBefore you can play on the server, you must first download the files that server \n requires. To do this: \n1. Click the button labeled \"Server Details\"\n 2. Look at the Server Description field Here, you should find the web \n site address.\n 3. Go to the web site listed. From there, you will usually find a clearly \n identified link for required downloads.\n 4. Download any needed files. They will typically be presented as a list \n of files. Note that some servers will require you to register at their web site \n before providing you with the needed files.\n 5. Extract the files. Most places will provide the files to you in a \n compressed format, so that they can be downloaded faster. For files ending in \n \".7z\" or \".rar\", or \".tar.gz\", you can extract \n them using WinRar. If the file ends in .zip, or if Windows lists it as a \"Compressed \n Folder\", you can open it directly without installing anything else. Some \n servers do not give files in compressed format. . If the file does not end in \n \".rar\", \".7z\", \".zip\" or \".tar.gz\", \n then it has not been compressed. You can proceed directly to the next step without \n worrying about extracting the files first.\n6. Install the needed files. Here is a general guide showing where different \n files go -- remember that not all servers use all of these different types of \n files. The only thing that all servers will require is the \"PWC\" file.\n a) Files ending in PWC go in My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\pwc\n b) Files ending in TLK go in My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\tlk\n c) Files ending in HAK go in My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak\n d) If the file ingamegui.ini is included, it must be placed in My Documents\\Neverwinter \n Nights 2\\ui\\default\n7. Special files\n a) Some servers will have Campaign files. The Campaign files must go in a folder \n within My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Campaigns. The folder name to use will \n be provided to you -- usually it can be found in the information on the server's \n download page.\n b) Some servers will have files that must be placed in Override. Extract these \n files into My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override. Always remember that \n placing files in override can have unpredictable results, especially if you \n play on other servers, play other single player modules, or are still playing \n the official campaign.(b)\nFinally, please be aware that some servers do have automatic installers and \n other solutions for properly installing the needed files. If a web site provides \n you with specific instructions for installing or setting up, always follow those \n instructions instead of these.\nCommon Questions\nQ. There is no web site listed in server details. Where do I get the downloads \n from?\n\nA. Unfortunately, unless the server admin has provided you with the \n location of the downloads, you can't play on this server. You might try locating \n the web site by searching the web for the server name.\nQ. There is a web site, but I can't find the files on it anywhere.\nA. This is all too common. The best thing you can do is email the server \n administrator, explain that you could not find the downloads, and politely request \n that they direct you to the server downloads page.\nQ. The server description is cut off. I can't see the full web site!\nA. Unfortunately, many server admins don't seem to be aware that there \n is a limit to size of the Description field. Unless you can find the web site \n and file downloads through other means (such as searching for the server web \n on the web), you will not be able to join this server.\nQ. What are these fields \"Module Website\" and \"PWC File\" \n for? Wouldn't that be easier than having to type in the web site myself?\nA. If the server admin has set their server up properly, these fields \n will contain the web site of the server, and sometimes a link directly to the \n file you need to download. Currently, this only works if a server is in your \n History list, or your Favorites list. It will work from the main browser with \n a future patch.\nQ. What is a PWC file?\n\nA. This file contains the map information for the server that you are \n trying to connect to.\nQ. When I download the PWC file, I have the whole module?\n\nA. No. You have only the minimum files needed in order to log into a \n server. You don't have the creatures, items,scripts, and other resources that \n make up a server.\nQ . When I look at the server list, some servers are red, and some servers \n are grey. What does this mean?\n\nA. Red servers require a password to log in. You will most likely need \n to register at that server's web site in order to receive the password and download \n the needed files. Grey servers are running a different patch level than you \n have. This happens most commonly soon after a beta patch is released (some servers \n upgrade); and after a final patch is released (some servers are slow to upgrade).\nQ. I made a character and tried to log in, but was immediately sent back \n tot he main menu! What do I do? or\n Q. I made a character and tried to log in, and NWN2 crashed! What do I do?\n\nA. If either of these two things happens, this means that you have have \n not installed this module's PWC file. Refer to section titled Downloading Required \n Files for details on downloading and installing this file and others that you \n may need.\nQ.After making a character and trying to log in, I received an error message: \n \"Could not Load the Module: Missing Required HAK File\" . What do I \n do?\n\nA. You must visit the server's web site, and download and install the \n require HAK file(s) before you can connect to it.

This quick tuturial isn't going over animation method, but one helpful hint is to create a 128x128 layer and start Copy/Pasting that over to the next cell.

I couldn�t find any so I set to dissecting one of the areas that came with the main quest to see what I could see. The process I used was very helpful to me so I thought I would run through it here for you guys. \n\n\n\nThe first thing I did was copy one of the areas from the main quest, 2200_Port Llast. From the C:/Program Files/Atari/NWN2/Modules folder. Copy it into your /My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/Modules folder.\n\n\n\nNow open the same module up in your tool kit. Then load the area named 2200_Port Llast.\n\n\n\nUnder the �Show/Hide� option turn off the tree�s so they are not showing on the area overview.\n\n\n\nGo a spot that has lots of shading, like this one.\n\nExp 1 or see pic 1\n\n\n\nIn your toolkit, go to the Terrain tab and click on the �color �option. Set your color to the top left most white color under the palette and set the diameter of your brush to a wide diameter like this\n\nExp 2 or see pic 2\n\n\n\nNow starting at the bottom of the screen left click and hold and the left mouse button and drag the red circle over the area on the screen until it looks clear of shading like this. \n\nExp 3 or see pic 3\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, this is where you learn shading. Under the Edit drop down on the toolkit, click on the undo button. It should make all of the shading you just erased reappear. You can hit redo now and bring it back. Do this several times, moving the camera around to diiferent angles, and note how the darker shades are used in certain places and lighter shades usually surround it. You can do this with any area, and it really opens your eyes in some cases.\n\n\n(To experience this from your browser. Open both pics Exp1 and Exp3 from above and place them on top of each other. Then just take turns clicking the pics.)\n\n\n\nNext you want to �undo� the area so once again you have the shades on the hills. This time take one of the larger hills and erase only half the shades off of it with a smaller brush so that it looks like this.\n\n\n\nExp 4 or see pic 4 \n\n\n\n\n\nNow set your brush to a small size, around 2 inner and 4-5 outter, and play with the gray colors on the second from the top line of colors on the palette. I usually start with the grey color on the left most side and work my way right, using smaller brushes with the darker grays.\n\n\n\nWhat you want to do is recreate the shades on the hill so that it fits in. Once you have this down you can shade your own modules fairly easy. Using other areas from the main quest to model your own areas by. I know this seems simple to some, but when your starting fresh with a toolkit like this, little things like this help a lot. \n","Rating":8.56,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"83":{"Name":"VTM-Movies","Author":"Terridol","Submitted":20071213,"Updated":20071226,"Category":"Toolset","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This Video Training Module pertains to creating your own custom movies for your module like in NWN.\n\nThe ZIP file contains HQ version,\nYou'll probably need the DivX codec and player to view the High Quailty version.\n\nYou will need the Rad BINK video Tool found at: Link\n\nI'll take request for any other VTMs that the community needs.","Rating":9.94,"Votes":6,"Awards":[]},"84":{"Name":"How To Create and Use Custom Load Screens","Author":"Goudron","Submitted":20080115,"Updated":20080124,"Category":"Custom Content","Forum Thread":"Link","Short Description":"See Title","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is a very quick tutorial on how to create and use custom load screens. I couldn't find one, so here it is. Sure it's easy, but until you know how to do it you don't know how:\n\n1. You need some utilities: \n\nTani's NWN2Packer\n\nAn image editing program that saves images in tga format. I use JASC Photoshop Pro, Paintshop works, and try GIMP for free.\n\n2. Obtain the picture you want to use as a load screen. I prefer to take a screenshot of my area: If you're ingame, \"h\" is the default key to get rid of the gui junk all over the place. I took my screen shot while resting so the character was out of most of the picture, then I cropped her out of it. Loadscreens are wider than they are tall anyway, right?\n\nUPDATE: download the Spoon of Vanishing erf and import it into your module. It applies cutscene invis to your PC, so they're out of the picture too. See instructions below.\n\n3. Use your image editor to save as a .tga format. It can be saved in any resolution. Name it with a meaningful name. Put it someplace you'll remember how to get to.\n\n4. Now you need to modify the 2da file. Open up your 2da folder: usually C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights2\\Data\\2DA.zip\n\nInside you'll find loadscreens.2da amongst all the other files. Open that up with any simple text editor (I use notepad) and save somewhere else, such as the directory you put the tga file.\n\nUse your text editor to add a line at the bottom of your modified 2da. I use tab to move between each column - they don't line up, don't worry. For the line number, I used the next line number available at the end of the list. Mine was 168. Edit in this format:\n\n168 NameYouWantToSeeInToolset **** FileName(noextension) **** ****\n\nSave.\n\n5. You need to make a hak file to include your screenshot and modified 2da. Open up your nifty NWN2Packer. Create a new file. Add the tga and the modified 2da file - you can drag and drop them in if you don't want to navigate. Save as a hak file in your hak folder (My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak). Close the NWN2Packer.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the NWN2Packer to add your tga file and modified 2da file to an existing hak.\n\n6. Assuming you made a new hak, make an association between the module and the new hak. Open up your module in the toolset. Choose from the View Menu \"Module Properties.\" Look at your module properties in the properties tab. There's a button to hit to add hakpaks. Hit the button, add the hak you just created. Go to the desired area, check properties, go to loadscreen, and scroll to find your loadscreen.\n\n\nThat's it.\n\nHere's a nice tutorial about adding custom content in general: Click Here\n\nUpdated 1/20/2008: added link to GIMP, added numbering format, modified wording a little.\n\nUpdated 1/24/2008: Uploaded the Spoon of Vanishing erf. This has a simple tag based item script on a misc. thin object to allow you to apply cutscene invisibility. Simply import the erf to your module, then find the spoon in the items blueprints under miscellaneous other.","Rating":8.63,"Votes":6,"Awards":[]},"85":{"Name":"----","Author":"----","Submitted":20080125,"Updated":20120712,"Category":"Toolset","Forum Thread":"----","Link":"----","Short Description":"----","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"----","Rating":10,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"86":{"Name":"----","Author":"----","Submitted":20080126,"Updated":20120712,"Category":"Toolset","Forum Thread":"----","Link":"----","Short Description":"----","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"----","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"87":{"Name":"----","Author":"----","Submitted":20080126,"Updated":20120712,"Category":"Toolset","Forum Thread":"----","Link":"----","Short Description":"----","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"----","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"88":{"Name":"----","Author":"----","Submitted":20080130,"Updated":20120712,"Category":"Toolset","Forum Thread":"----","Link":"----","Short Description":"----","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"----","Rating":9.67,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"89":{"Name":"Baking Bridges and Docks","Author":"CryptoGlyph","Submitted":20080209,"Updated":20080223,"Category":"Modelling","Forum Thread":"Link","Short Description":"Walkable Bridges and Docks","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"Making walkable bridges and docks without the walkmesh helper.\n\nThe key to making adjacent bridge and dock placeables walkable is to raise the terrain adjacent to and outside corners of the placeables.

Once it has started, click File->New->tlk.\nThis will create a new .tlk file. Now you can start entering in your load hints in the right hand panel of the main part of the window. To do this, use the following steps:\n1) Double click on the textbox below \"String\". This will make this textbox larger and allow you to enter in the text for a single load hint.\n2) When you are finished, click on the empty white space that has appeared beneath your current entry in order to finish entering text.\n3) Double click the new entry in order to open it up and enter in a new load hint.\n4) Continue to create new entries (one for each separate load hint) until you have created all the load hints you desire.\n\nSave this tlk file with a name relevant to your mod. Then copy it to your My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/tlk directory. (Or simply save it there to start with)\n\nNow you need to open up one of the 2DA files that ships with either the OC or MotB - 2DA.zip or 2DA_X1.zip, respectively. These can be found in your Program Files/Neverwinter Nights 2/Data directory. While it is useful to have the entire content of these files unzipped to a directory, all we really need is the nwn2_tips.2da file - so take a copy of this file (don't mess with the original), and open it up in your favourite text editor.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is to reduce the size of the file. If you look at the 2DA file, it should look something like this:\n\n2DAV2.0\n\nAreaGameStateMinGameStateMaxWeightingStringDebugStringComment\n1************1181767********\n2************1181768********\n3************1181769********\n\nNote there will be a LOT more entries than I've listed here. \nLook at TlkEdit2 and look at the number of the last string you've created. Now, add ONE to this number, and that is how many lines you will need in the 2da. This is because in the tlk, numbering starts from 0 and in the 2da, numbering starts from 1. If you've managed to create MORE load hints than there are existing entries, you can simply copy existing lines and increase the numbering to add new lines. However, if you are in that situation, don't do that right now, but read ahead and potentially save yourself a bit of time.\n\nIn order to reference our the load hints that are in our custom .tlk file, we need to modify the 2DA file to tell it to look in OUR .tlk file rather than the default tlk file that ships with the game. Fortunately, this is a relatively simple process. Looking at the headings and the fields in the 2DA, we can see that we need to edit the fifth field - which is a number containing a reference to the string we want to display. Simply put, this number tells the game which piece of text to display as a load hint. All we need to do is to work out what number to put down.\n\nIn order to do this, switch back into TlkEdit2. If you go to the View Menu and select \"Display User StrRef\" (or hit Ctrl-U), you'll notice that the numbers in the left hand panel of the main window change from 0, 1, 2 and so on to 16777216, 16777217, 16778218, and so on. These numbers are the ones you need to enter in the string column for the associated load hint.\n\nSo if we go back to our 2DA and starting changing things, it should look something like the following:\n\n2DAV2.0\n\nAreaGameStateMinGameStateMaxWeightingStringDebugStringComment\n1************116777216********\n2************116777217********\n3************116777218********\n\nJust continue down modifying all the strings down until you've reached the end of the load hints you have.\n\nAlternatively, to save you the hassle of modifying the 2da yourself, simply download the nwn2_tips.2da that I've attached to this tutorial and use that. It has lines for a total of 50 load hints, so you can delete (or add) lines as necessary.\n\nOnce the 2da is succesfully created, you can incorporate it into a hak pak for your module's release, or simply use it from your override folder while developing. However, you still need to tell the module that it needs to use the tlk file you made earlier. In order to do this, go into the toolset, open up your module's properties, and type in the full name of the tlk file (including the .tlk extension) in the Custom TLK field under the properties window.\n\nWhen you need to convert it to a hak, run NWN2Packer, create a new hak file, then import the nwn2_tips.2da file into the hak (along with another other 2das you might have modified or any other custom content you're including in your module). Remember to save the .hak file once you are finished, and ensure that you set your module to use that hak file inside the toolset - again go to module properties in order to include it. This opens up a dialog box as opposed to simply letting you type in the name of the hak file, and you'll need to click the ADD button on the bottom of the dialog box in order to be able to select your hak file.\n\nWith that, you should have custom load hints in your mod!

Just be patient and use copious amounts of google and you should do just fine. Besides, it�s all super easy!\n\nThings you will need:\n&#61692;An SSF Editor\n&#61692;A TLK Editor\n&#61692;A USB Microphone\n&#61692;Sound Editing Software\n\nSSF Editor � You�re going to need this in order to edit your SSF files. SSFEditor, the one I use, I got off the vault and its super intuitive. \n\nTKL Editor � You�re not actually going to be editing the TLK file. You need this editor so you can browse through the TLK file in order to name your voice sets. I use Aussie NWN2 TLK Editor. There is also TabularFramework (2DA-Editor & TLK-Editor) which edits your 2da file as well, but it loads much more slowly than the Aussie one and you don�t need an editor for your 2da file anyway. Any text editor (such as notepad) will do the trick.\n\nUSB Microphone � Okay, here�s where the money might start coming in. If you want to do any recordings of any sort of quality you will need some good equipment. Now, I use an icicle brand preamp and an audio-technica condenser mic. The setup cost me about 100 bucks in all. Now, for something as simple as this you�re not going to want to waste a Franklin. A USB mic is going to be your best friend. You can snag one of those for 20 bucks. (Little tip for gamers, if you play Rockband or any other game that has singing then your game mic might plug right into your computer.) A USB mic isn�t the way to go for professionals, but for a hobbyist they�re just great. Why USB you ask? Well a regular mic will plug into your soundcard to record, and if your soundcard isn�t made specifically for recording (it most likely isn�t) then you�re going to have electronic back feed from all the stuff buzzing around in your computer. In other words there will be static. Now, you can edit out this static, but the quality will be that much worse for it. It�s better to plop down the 20 for a USB mic.\n\nSound Editing Software � Here�s another place you might have to spend money on. If you�re a professional you�re going to want something like Cakewalk or Adobe Audition. Those programs are powerful, but expensive and (in audition�s case) take up a lot of space to run and if you don�t have a good soundcard they won�t be that useful for you. If you�re using a mac then you�re already setup with Garage Band and wont need any editing software. However, chances are you have a PC like myself and need to get your own. For a hobbyist Audacity is going to be your new best friend. It�s small, it�s simple, and it gets the job done. Hell, I have audition and I still use Audacity for the actual recording as it�s less likely to lag on me.\n\n\nWell, now that you have your stuff you�re going to need to know how to use it. Here�s where the fun part comes in.\n\nFirst step is recording your set. You�re going to need to make them wav files for this. Now, if you have a professional sound editor then you already know how to use it. So I�m going to focus this tutorial on using Audacity. (Sorry mac users, I�ve never even touched Garage Band.) \n\nThese here are the lines you�re going to need:\n�Attack - Command Issued - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Battlecry 1 - Yelled while running to battle - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Battlecry 2 - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Battlecry 3 - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Heal me - Command Issued - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Help - Command Issued - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Enemies - Enemies have been Sighted - PC\n�Flee - Command Issued - PC/Henchman\n�Taunt - A skill that tries to make the enemy only attack you - PC\n�Guard Me - Command Issued - PC\n�Hold Position - Command Issued - PC\n�Attack Grunt 1 - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Attack Grunt 2 - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Attack Grunt 3 - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Pain Grunt 1 - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Pain Grunt 2 - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Pain Grunt 3 - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Near Death - Announcement that you are near death - PC\n�Death - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Spell Failed - Announcement that a spell has failed - PC/Henchman\n�Weapon Ineffective - Announcement that you weapon does no damage - PC/Henchman\n�Follow Me - Command Issued - PC\n�Look Here - Announcement that you have spotted something - PC\n�Group Party - Command Issued - PC\n�Move Over - Command Issued - PC\n�Pick Lock - Command Issued - PC\n�Search - Command Issued - PC\n�Go Stealthy - Command Issued - PC\n�Can Do - PC/Henchman\n�Cannot Do - PC/Henchman\n�Task Complete - PC/Henchman\n�Encumbered - Announcement that you have too much in your inventory and are now slowed - PC/Henchman\n�Selected - said when you are clicked - PC/Henchman\n�Hello - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Yes - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�No - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Stop - Command Issued - PC\n�Rest - Command Issued - PC\n�Bored - Said when you have been standing too long - PC\n�Goodbye - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Poisoned - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Thank You - PC\n�Laugh - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Curse - Said when something is failed - PC\n�Cheer - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Something to Say - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Good Idea - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Bad Idea - PC/Henchman/NPC\n�Threaten - PC/Henchman/NPC\n\nYou can write down exactly what you want to say, paste that up there into a text file to keep open and just improve (which is what I do) or even snag voice clips from other games or movies and put it in their place. Whatever your method you must have all those lines conveyed in some way.\n\nNow, using Audacity to do this is like pie. You open it up and click the record button (that is the red dot) then record. That�s it. No formatting or fancy things. When you�re done give what you recording a listen. You might have blown into the mic by accident or maybe you just don�t like how it sounds. Hit the little X button on the corner of the recording and do it again. (Little tip on mic blowing, keep the mic at the corner of your face instead of in front. That way breathing and blowing sound more natural and not like you blew into a microphone.) If you�re happy with what you did (be sure to cut out the silent bits at the beginning and end of the file) then highlight the sound, go to Effect-Amplify. (For audition users this would be called normalize.) You�re doing this so you can hear the voice at an appropriate level in the game. Listen to it again to see if you missed any inconsistencies. [Little tip for people using a regular mic instead of USB. (Even though I told you not to.) You�re going to want to wait and record some silence first. This is so you can edit the static out later. Highlight the silent staticy bit and Effect-Noise Removal. Click the Get Noise Profile button. After that highlight the whole recording and click Remove Noise. Cake.] Play around with the effects a bit (if you�re happy with what you have and are afraid of losing it then just save first) sometimes you can discover really neat tricks that way.\n\nWhen you�re ready to save File-Export as Wave (or save as wav) and name it something like voice_attack. If you plan on doing more than one of these uniformity is key. Always naming things the same way but changing one part (like what was in front of that underscore) ensures that you don�t make silly typos as well as saves you mounds of time. Now me, I name my stuff exactly like it is on the list. voice_attack voice_battlecry1 voice_battlecry2 etcetera. When I make another soundest I just change the first part. anothervoice_attack anothervoice_battlecry1. It doesn�t matter how long the file name is or what you name it as long as it is a WAV file. It can�t be anything else or the game won�t recognize it right. \n\n\nOnce you have your recordings done the rest of the steps can be taken in any order you want. I don�t do them in a specific way though it helps to if you want to make sure you don�t skip something.\n\nSo let�s edit our SSF then.\n\nYou know that editor I had your download? Well open the sucker up. Now, there�s a little catch here. If you�re making one from scratch you wont be able to select anything below Group Party. This does not make for happy fun times. You can, however, open up an already made SSF file. Just download one of mine from the vault. (As an added bonus if you named your stuff like I do then you have even LESS work ahead of you this way.) I didn�t really get my format down until the Still Mind set. Extract the SSF file (in the still mind set it�d be named vs_histhrall.ssf) it honestly doesn�t matter what you name this file. Keeping it short of logical will be helpful though. This part should be pretty self explanatory, but I�m going to explain anyway. You�ll notice that you have two options here. Resource ref and String ref. Resource ref is the name of the wav file that you want the game to associate with that action. The String ref is the line of text that might pop up over their head when the talk. We�re not going to touch the String ref. Keeping it at -1 means that nothing will pop over the character�s head. Don�t go typing in the dialog here either. The string ref is a number associated with a line that you�ll find in the tlk file. You�re already going to have to drudge through that to find a name for your soundset. No point in doing it for all the lines too.\n\n\nSpeaking of name, you�re going to want to find that. This here is the fun part. Let�s open up the TLK editor you downloaded and open up the dialog.tlk file. (Some editors already know where this is, but if yours doesn�t you can find it in the default directory C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2.) DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! Seriously, if you don�t know what you�re doing you can really mess up your game! We�re only doing this so we can sift through strings. Either use the find option or scroll through the file to find one you want. The string of numbers is important here. You need to copy or write them down so you don�t forget it. Also, be careful if you�re using the find option in the Aussie tlk editor. Sometimes it will start replacing a bit of word while you�re still typing in what you want to look for. Just make sure you NEVER SAVE when you exit the program in case you didn�t notice it doing this.\n\n\nOnce you have your string (1942 is one of several for Still Mind) you�re going to need to crack open the soundset.2da. (Copy the one from the 2da.zip in C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Data if you don�t have one in your override already.) You can use notepad or an editor for this. You�re going to see some options here. E. C. Patterson was kind enough to explain these to me when I had that same �wtf� look on my face the first time I opened the soundset.2da. \n\nLABEL = The name of the voiceset that will appear in the TS selection menu and probably the character creation menu as well (for PC voicesets), IF the STRREF is absent (i.e. = to ****)\n\nRESREF = the file name of the ssf, without the extension.\n\nSTRREF = the dialog.tlk line number if you want the label to get its string value from that. Enter **** if you just want to stick with the LABEL value and not have to find a suitable STRREF from the default tlk, or create a custom tlk.\n\nGENDER = 0 : Male, 1: Female. Only really important for PC voicesets.\n\nTYPE = possible values : 0-5. Refer to soundsettypes.2da. 0=PC, 1=Companion etc. Type 0s are the most complete (all 50+ voice chats) and it goes down from there. Only type 0s show up during character creation.\n\nIn other words: \nFolder_That_Holds_Wave_Files SSF_File Number_From_TLK Gender 0\nOR\nThrall vs_histhrall 1942 1 0\n\nSo pick yourself a blank line (try not to conflict with other voicesets if you can) and put that info in there. Now when you start a new character the voice will show up in the list. Well, so long as you have both the edited 2da and the folder holding your voiceset (with the ssf included inside the folder) in your My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\override. \n\n\nNow that should be it. You�re done. You have a spiffy custom recorded voiceset for your character and can share it with the world if you want. \n\n\n�BUT SEN!� you say. �I want to make a preview just like you because you are my idol!� Well, strange voice in my head, you can do that by simply looking up how to make a wmv on Google because I am quite done with this tutorial. \n","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"129":{"Name":"World Maps For Newbs v1.02","Author":"MikeLM9215","Submitted":20100626,"Updated":20100721,"Category":"Toolset","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"How to use the NWN2, MOTB and SOZ world maps, alter text in the map boxes, and change the worldmap xmls to fit your campaign.\n\nNow added 15 worldmaps and their associative files (all shown but Hillsfar and Dalelands), 4 backgrounds to world maps (all shown but must be named world_map_bg.tga), 51 map buttons (17 pressed, 17 hover and 17 normal), and the files for NWN2, MOTB and SOZ listed in the appendices.\n\nv1.01 Fix four images to be clearer.

It may not be the best or most complete way, but it suites my purposes quite nicely. This method removes the glossy shine from textures, and that was my primary purpose in pursuing this information. Thanks goes out to: dunniteowl, BigfootNZ, JasonNH, and Hellfire_RWS for helping me figure this out. Thanks Guys!\n\nFor each texture, there needs to be three .tga files.\n\n1.) The Primary Diffuse + Layer Mask (TT_MyTexture)\n2.) The Secondary Diffuse + Layer Mask (TT_MyTexture_c)\n3.) The Normal Map WITHOUT an Alpha Channel (TT_MyTexture_n)\n\nDownload the NormalMap plug-in for GIMP and install it.\n\nStep 1:\nYou'll need a .bmp image scaled to 64x64 pixels in size. Make a copy of the texture you're working with, then resize the image in GIMP to 64x64 pixels. In GIMP, go to \"Image\" then go to \"Scale Image\". To resize the image, click the small button behind the number field (looks sort of like a broken chain link). Type in the new size, then hit \"ok\". Put the 64x64 .bmp image into your Program Files/Neverwinter Nights 2/NWN2Toolset/Terrain folder.\n\nStep 2:\nNext, make another copy of the original image. Scale this texture image to a multiple of 8; I use 1024x1024 (remember, it needs to be in multiples of 8). 512x512 would be acceptable also. Then, click on \"Layer\", then \"Mask\". Select \"Add Layer Mask...\". Now, click on \"Black (full transparency). Click the \"Add\" button. Next, go to \"Layer\", then \"Mask\", and click \"Apply Layer Mask\". Now, save the image as .tga (example: TT_MyTexture).\n\nStep 3:\nOpen the image file that has the layer mask that we were just working with. Save it as, for example, TT_MyTexture_c. This file must have the \"_c\" at the end of it to work properly.\n\nStep 4:\nOpen the image that you first scaled to multiples of 8 (the picture with the actual terrain image). Next, go to \"Filters\" tab, go down to \"Map\", then \"Normalmap...\". Where it says \"Filter\" in the Normalmap box, choose your filter type; I used 5x5, then hit \"Ok\". Now, click \"Layer\", then \"Mask\", then \"Add Layer Mask\". Now click \"Layer\", \"Mask\", then \"Apply Layer Mask\". Save this file as, for example, TT_MyTexture_n. This file must have the \"_n\" at the end of it to work properly.\n\nStep 5:\nEdit the \"terrainmaterials.2da\". Find a blank row in the .2da file and input the basic name of your texture. Example: TT_MyTexture. Note: I don't know what the other rows in the .2da file are for, so you can play around with those if you'd like. I usually set each to a value of 255, then select for the last entry, the terrain type that most resembles my new texture. If you have a grassy texture, type in \"Grass\".\n\nStep 6:\nPut the \"terrainmaterials.2da\", and the three .tga files into your My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/Override folder. Fire up the toolset, then start painting the textures down!\n\n*Update*\n- Added more information on applying layer masks.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"135":{"Name":"Amphibious Bagel's NWN2 Video Tutorial Series","Author":"Amphibious Bagel","Submitted":20110317,"Updated":20110325,"Category":"Toolset","Short Description":"English Video Tutorials on the NWN2 Electron Toolset and Custom Content Topics","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This entry is a listing of NWN2 video tutorials and screencasts created to help teach and train players how to use the NWN2 Toolset and to create custom content for the game.\n\nThis Vault entry will be updated as new video tutorials are made available.\n\nAnd as always, thank you to all of the wonderful developers and players that have put so much into NWN2 and the community!\n\nIf you enjoyed the videos, please remember to vote, and if you have any questions or would like to see a video tutorial on a particular subject, leave a comment for me here.\n\nCheers!","Rating":9.94,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"136":{"Name":"NWN2 Toolset Tutorials","Author":"Anna Tito","Submitted":20110603,"Updated":20111129,"Category":"Toolset","Link":"Link","Short Description":"Art and Design tutorials for beginners with a little on code","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"I taught NWN2 modding at RMIT University as part of the Game Studio Course and developed these notes around a basic level structure provided by the lecturer.
