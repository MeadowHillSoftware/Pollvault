There is no way to adjust an armor's Armor Check penalty, which is the primary advantage of masterwork armors. Also, only masterwork armor is the only kind of armor that can be magically hanced. There are not any blueprints included at this time, these will need to be created by the builder. Obviously I can't test this... so who knows if it works? hehe.\n\n\nThe difference between the two hak files:\n\nHak 1: The one with 'override' in the filename will make all armor blueprints included with the toolset masterwork... this means you need to create new blueprints for mundane armors. Use this if you want to continue using the blueprints included with the toolset. (Note: all magic armor and armor made with special materials such as Adamantine and Mithral should have the masterwork bonus to Armor Check Penalty, so you will only need to recreate the 12 mundane armors and 3 mundane shields.\n\nHak 2: This hak does not change anything about the blueprints included in the toolset, it merely adds more options to the \"armor type (for game rules)\" menus. This means you should create all new magic armors and special material armors using the new armor types so they receive the reduced Armor Check penalty.\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nAdd a 'hak' folder to your toolset directory.\n\nExtract the .hak file you wish to use to the 'hak' directory.\n\nIn the toolset, go to \"Module Properties\" and browse to get to .hak file... you have to select \"add\" once you get to the 2nd screen.\n\nYou should then be able to select the new armor types in the armor properties option labelled \"armor type (for game rules)\". You may need to reopen the module to have the new 2da and .hak applied to the module.\n\n\n\nDue to lack of information on custom TLK files... (which is required for the menu in the toolset to display things like \"Masterwork Full Plate\" correctly) I have a bit of a workaround, but you have to sort of decipher what means what:\n\n\nStats for:Appears in toolset menu as:Characteristics adjusted:\n\nMundane Wooden ShieldsLight Shield Mould, Heavy Shield MouldPrice, weight\n\nMasterwork Wooden ShieldsDuskwood Light Shield, Duskwood Heavy ShieldArmor Check Penalty, price, weight\n\nAll other Masterwork Armors+1... such as Full Plate +1Armor Check Penalty, price\n\nDarkwood ShieldsIronwood Light, Heavy, and Tower ShieldsArmor Check Penalty, price, weight\n\nMithral ShieldsAppears correctly Arcane Spell Failure, armor Check Penalty, price, weight\n\n\nNotes on Implementation:\n\n- for Mundane and Masterwork Wooden Shields, be sure to change the material away from steel... not sure if this affects gameplay significantly.\n\n- Some items are not particularly effected gameplay-wise.. such as Masterwork Leather Armor (it is just more expensive). \n\n- All magical, mithral, and adamantine armor should technically be masterwork.\n\n- I am unsure whether or not Mithral Tower Shields actually exist within the 3.5e ruleset... they are normally made of wood. I included the stats for it though, because it already exists as a NWN2 blueprint anyway","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"2":{"Name":"Snow texture for override","Author":"spider661","Submitted":20061003,"Updated":20061107,"Category":"Other","Patch":"1.00","Description":"This is kinda a request off the nwn2 forums.\nsome where tying to do snow covered areas..\nwell with this you can now do them in 2 diff types of ground coverings.\n\nplace the tga files snow1.tga and snow2.tga and the 2da file terrainmaterials.2da in the override folder defualt location.\n-\n-\nC:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Presale-Toolset\\Override\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n\nplace the bmp files snow1.bmp and snow2.bmp in the Terrain folder defualt location\n-\n-\nC:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2 Presale-Toolset\\NWN2Toolset\\Terrain\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSorry i cant figer out how to make a hak work with the beta toolset i think the haks are ither broken or im jsut placeing them in the wronge place.. or you cant use the nwn1 hak maker.\n\nether way they will work like this\n\n","Rating":9.38,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"3":{"Name":"TME - Terrain Material Expansion","Author":"Phex","Submitted":20061008,"Updated":20070123,"Category":"Other","Patch":"1.00","Description":"TME - Terrain Material Expansion\n\n75 New Terrain Textures\n\nVersion 2.0\n\n\n***\n\nThe TME 2.0 features 75 new Materials for texturing your Exterior Area�s.\nIt�s the second Release in a Series of Textures to enhance Exterior Design.\nActually this ist for Override, but will be a HAK as soon as a working Hak-Utility is available.\n\nNew in Version 2: All Textures are now in DDS Format and every Material has a Normal Map.\n\nHope you enjoy,\n\nGreetz\nPhex\n\n***\n\nInstall:\n\nCopy the content of the following Folders to your Toolset: \n\n�Override� -> �your_NWN2_path\\Override\\�, \n�Terrain� -> �your_NWN2_path\\NWN2Toolset\\Terrain\\�\n\nStart the Toolset and have fun...\n\n***\n\nIf you find this usefull, please vote for my work and help me getting this Package a �Standard� Extension for future NWN2-Projects.

Not all placeables will respond if you enter tint colours for them beacuse not all models have a tint map applied to them or a tint map created for them. The purpose of this pack is to provide the models and textures necessary to enable untintable objects to be tintable. This first release enables all five interior doors to be tinted. A readme is included in the .rar file.\n\nv0.2:\n\nAdded the 2 fireplace placeables and made the pack into a proper hak pak.\n\n\nv0.25:\n\n\nAdded 39 walls: keep, city and stone. Keep in mind that tints will work better on some textures than others. A light colour tint is usually best. Also, with this update you will notice that, by default, the walls appear pitch black. This is because the actual toolset blueprints have pure black entered as the tint colours. If you have any placed instances of the walls you will need to update them with tint colours to get rid of the pitch black appearance. Pure white in the tint fields will give you the default texture appearance as it was before applying the hak pak. From that baseline you can adjust tints as desired.\n\n\nHeed House 2","Rating":9.25,"Votes":6,"Awards":[]},"6":{"Name":"3.5 Edition PNP","Author":"Even","Submitted":20061107,"Updated":20100401,"Category":"Code Modifications","Forum Thread":"Link","Patch":"1.03","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Simply place the files into your Override directory to have them take effect in the main campaign.

Because of changes to feat.2da between versions, do not use this file with 1.04 or later!\nUp through v1.03, the Practiced Spellcaster feats (one each for Bard, Cleric, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer and Wizard) do not correctly appear during level-up. This is a known issue that hopefully will be fixed officially in a future patch. Although it is possible to forcibly give the feat to a character using console commands, doing so makes the character illegal (since they will have one more feat than they should).\nThis modified feat.2da file allows a character to choose a Practiced Spellcaster feat legally. A feat is made available if the character has at least 4 ranks in Spellcraft and at least 1 level in an appropriate spellcasting class. For example, with at least 1 Wizard level and 4 Spellcraft ranks, Practiced Spellcaster (Wizard) will appear as a feat choice under Spellcasting. Provided the requirements are met, the feat appears regardless of which class is currently being leveled.\nInstallationExtract feat.2da and copy it to your NWN2 Override directory; it is not necessary to add this to a module as a hak.

It consists of simple squared invisible placeables with a walkable walkmesh. When scaled, the Walkmesh Helper objects are handy to use along with Walkmesh Cutters (found under trigger) to have more control of the walkmesh. This especially is evident when using a combination of placeables, like several bridges. Place the Walkmesh Helper just above the walkable plane of the placeables, scale it to properly cover the desired area, and cut away with Walkmesh Cutters as fit. You might get the best result by converting the placeables to environment objects, but it shouldn't be required.\n\nIt is intended to work as an override, and doesn't require that the end users of your module have this package in place. They will still experience the effect it has on the walkmesh without it installed. You can, however, still alternatively use it as a hak pak if you prefer.\n\nPackage includes:\n\nFor override:\n\n* PLC_BR_walkmeshhelper_*.MDB - The actual model file of the basic Walkmesh Helper. S is the stone version and W is the wood. Place in your My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override\n\n* PLC_BR_walkmeshhelperramp_*.MDB - This is the model file of the ramp Walkmesh Helper. S is the stone version and W is the wood. Place in same location as above.\n\n* placeables.2da - A version of the 2da that adds the Walkmesh Helpers.

For instance, the cargo ship's wheel has been moved to the uppermost deck and a beam is placed below it to show some sort of linkage between the wheel and the the rudder.

This means that any old characters will now have a different hairstyle than what you are used to. Grab the GFF Editor (or a similar app) and have a blast figuring out which style is which. Zod knows I can't remember. There is an app on the Vault called the Pack File Explorer that can display MDB objects, which helps immensely in finding what you want. Of course, you can always re-roll the character with the in-game character generator and choose the hairstyle normally.\n\nI can tell you that all of my hairstyles begin with '50'.\n\n 2) Altered hair textures.\n\nBasically, the textures are the same, but I did make some changes to the tinting and specularity. Still not sure if I'm completely happy with it (will I ever?).\n\n 3) Re-worked hairstyles.\n\nThe very first hairstyles that I did for both genders were starting to show their age (and my inexperience) so I recreated them.\n\n 4) Existing hairstyles for other races.\n\nI copied the hairstyles for the new female elven sub-race(s?) and tieflings. The tieflings have horned versions.\n\n 5) New female heads.\n\nOk, I wasn't going to do this, but I had some extra 3D doodles just sitting on my machine so I made them useable. Blame them for this update taking so long. Races that use them are: Elves (all sub-races...yes, even the MotB sub-races), half-elves, half-drow, humans, aasimars, and tieflings. I'll get to the genasi at a later date.\n\n 6) Deleted the male head.\n\nHated it. Deleted it.\n\n 7) Deleted a female head.\n\nI wasn't really crazy about the one I deleted. I was about to axe the other one, but kept it since I didn't have anything that looked similar enough to replace it with.\n\n 8) Deleted some old resources.\n\nThe demilich skull is gone. MotB added its own so mine was no longer needed.\n\nThe fixes are also gone. While those errors still exist, it is not my job to fix them. I will not be tracking down Obsidian's errors to correct them anymore. If you find any, please notify them.\n\n 9) Added NPC hairstyles for human females.\n\nI did this for those that want to give Safiya some hair. For this reason, I also added a UTC file for her that already has hair added. It's in the 'Safiya-hair' folder and if it's in the Override directory, then Safiya will have some hair when you start a new game. If you want to alter an existing save-game to give Safiya a rug, then use the GFF Editor to open up the 'ROS-Safiya.ros' file and change the Appearance_Hair attribute. For example, if you want her to use the N_HHF_Hair56 object (which is what I gave her in the UTC file) then look for the Appearance_Hair attribute and chage its value from the default (which is 0 I believe) to '56'. Next time you load that save-game, she will have the style you picked.\n\n*******************************************************************\n\n Known errors:\n\nSome of the elven sub-races have a wierd eye-blink animation. Sometimes the eyes will not close fully, and sometimes the eyes will bug out a little.\n\nI have no idea why, other than the animations are different for those sub-races. Fixing those errors will require altering the heads a great deal, which I may or may not do. Just be aware that these errors exist.\n\nSub-races effected by this are the Sun Elves, Wood-elves, wild-elves (I think) and Half-Drow.\n\n*******************************************************************\n\n Usage:\n\nAs usual, the Override files go in the Override directory. The files have their own folder structure for easier file-management. The hak files are associated to each module through the toolset.\n\nAs far as I know, this MotB update should also work for those who do not have the expansion. The content for the new races will not be available in-game, of course, but everything else should work fine. I say should because I do not have a fresh install without the expansion for testing purposes.\n\nI will not be supporting the older collection anymore. My suggestion ould be to delete it all and use this update. Delete the appearance.2da file with extreme prejudice, as it is no longer needed and causes problems that shouldn't have been there in the first place. Thank you, Obsidian, for creating a pain in my posterior.\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nThe \"I want to really screw with your stuff...can I?\" section:\n\nUse any of the models and/or textures in any way you see fit. So long as proper credit is given to me for the original work, then I won't make a fuss. Use a good dose of common sense and common courtesy...with just a dash of brown-nosing.\n\n*******************************************************************\n\n Future Plans:\n\nStep 1) Rest\n\nStep 2) ...\n\nStep 3) PROFIT!\n\nIf only it were that easy. I'm actually gonna spend some time tracking down other errors and fixing them, but I'm gonna take my sweet time with it. Full-time jobs are not agreeable with happy-fun-time model making.","Rating":9.64,"Votes":93,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"63":{"Name":"Galchutt 's heads","Author":"Galchutt","Submitted":20070108,"Updated":20070108,"Category":"PC Parts","Patch":"1.03","Description":"Two human female heads.

After I finally got it right, I figured I might as well put it on here. So here it is, my first NWN(2) mod ever.\n\n\nInstallation: (Override version)\nUzip all files to NWN2/Override. This does not override existing official familiars but it's not recommended to have other custom familiars installed since the hen_familiar.2da files do conflict. Besides you can only have 1 familiar on at a time so ... there should be no problems.\n\nIf you want to use this on your character, you have to either start a new sorc/wiz and customize the package so you can select your familiar, or you can edit the save file of an existing sorc/wiz by opening My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/saves/playerlist.ifo with GFFeditor and go to -1/Mod_PlayerList/0/FamiliarType and change that to 8. Right above that, you can also change the FamiliarName, if you so desired.\n\nIf you want the familiar to attack by itself, you will have to turn off the Puppet mode everytime you summon it, which happens to be really annoying. I don't know of any file that governs the default behavior of familiars or any NPC so I can't do anything about that. But if you know of it, PLEASE TELL EVERYONE!!!\n\n\nThings of note:\n-The familiar gives the Toughness feat.\n\n-The model for this familiar is 50% of the size of the mobs you fight so you can see the details really well. I didn't like the tiny little things you normally get.\n\n-The stats of the familiar at lvls 15-20 are a lot higher than they should be as to be overpowered. At level 20, most of its stats are over 20. I know some people don't like this so I've included a section on how to customize your own Blade Spider familiar.

Based on this he makes a Plan of Attack. With it he knows where each inch of each opponent will be. Because of this the Dark Ninja can only plan ahead for a few seconds, this duration is based at: Dark Ninja level + (Concentration Skill / 5) seconds.\nEach hit gives 1 Plan of Attack point that will last for the duration.\nEach hit by an opponent will substract 2 Plan of Attack points.\nWith 5 or more active Plan of Attack points, you will be hasted.\n\nWhen fighting with fists:\nEvery 2 Plan of Attack points gives 1 point bonus to AC, Attack bonus & Damage for the duration.

Half of the outcome will be granted and from the other half a random number will be chosen. If the total is less then 1, then the total will be resetted a 1 percent.

For ages the druids would call the Elven Rangers for help if there was something out of there reach, but today... how many are there left to answer that call?\nThe Elven Ranger has had a rare training in the traditional elven weapons. But because of this training, his ability to fight with any other weapon (besides the long sword and long bow) has extremely decreased. This resolves in a penalty to attack equal the Elven Rangers level! If the Elven Ranger is fighting unarmed, this penalty is halved.\n\nRequirements:\n- Bard level 1.\n- Druid level 5.\n\nHit die: d8\n\nBase Attack Bonus: Special (High)\n\nSkill points: 6 (+ intelligence bonus)\n\nClass skills:\nConcentration, CraftAlchemy, CraftTrap, Diplomacy, SetTrap, DisableTrap, Heal, Hide, MoveSilently, Listen, Spot, Lore, Search, Spellcraft, Survival, Taunt, Tumble.\n\nMax Elven Ranger level: 10\n\n\nSwift Mark\n(Elven Ranger level 1)\nIf the Elven Ranger isn't hit by any weapon, he tries to mark a target besides his primary target. This comes at the cost of some AC just before the marking because he needs his concentration. If he succeeds in marking this target he gets a free shot at this target with his long bow.\n\nEvery hit after the third hit an Elven Ranger gets a chance to mark a secondary target,\nbut every hit after the seventh hit an Elven Ranger gets also a chance to mark a third target,\nand every sixtienth hit an Elven Ranger gets a chance to mark a fourth target.\n\nAt level 1:\nThe hit count will be reset from 4 to 0 after the Elven Ranger attempt to mark a secondary target.\nAt level 3:\nThe hit count will be reset from 4 to 2 after the Elven Ranger attempt to mark a secondary target.\nAt level 5:\nThe hit count will be reset from 8 to 4 after the Elven Ranger attempt to mark a third target.\nAt level 7:\nThe hit count will be reset from 8 to 6 after the Elven Ranger attempt to mark a third target.\nAt level 9:\nThe hit count will be reset from 16 to 8 after the Elven Ranger attempt to mark a fourth target.\nAt level 10:\nThe hit count will be reset from 16 to 12 after the Elven Ranger attempt to mark a fourth target.\n\nIf the hit count is greater then 2 the Elven Ranger gets a penalty total of 2 on his AC.\nIf the hit count is greater then 6 the Elven Ranger gets a penalty total of 5 on his AC.\nIf the hit count is greater then 14 the Elven Ranger gets a penalty total of 9 on his AC.\n\nIf the Elven Ranger gets hitted (melee or ranged), his concentration is disturbed. This results in a penalty of 5 on the Elven Rangers hit count.\nThe Elven Rangers hit count will never drop below zero or get higher then sixtien\nIf the last hit was (3 * ((Elven Ranger level / 2) + 2)) seconds ago, the Elven Rangers hit count will decreases by 1. This will happen every 3 seconds there after until the Elven Ranger hits a target or the hit count is zero.\n\n\nSneak/Death attack\n(Elven Ranger level 1)\nAt level 1 the Elven Ranger recieves a sneak attack.\nAt levels 4, 7 & 10 the Elven Ranger recieves a death attack.\n\nEnchant arrow\n(Elven Ranger level 1)\nThe Elven Ranger can enchant his arrows with +1.\nThis ability increases at every odd level.\n\nCleave\n(Elven Ranger level 1)\nThis ability will improve at levels 5 & 10.\n\nTrack\n(Elven Ranger level 1)\n\nSwift Feet\n(Elven Ranger level 1)\nThe Elven Ranger moves at an increased speed.\nThis ability will improve every level.\n\nBladed defence\n(Elven Ranger level 2)\nThe Elven Ranger recieves a bonus of +1 to his AC when fighting with a long sword onehanded.\nThis ability will improve at levels 5 & 8.\n\nPoison arrow\n(Elven Ranger level 2)\nEvery two minutes the Elven Ranger can poison his arrows.\nIf the target fails his save against poison and is not imune, he's poisoned.\nOn level 2 he has only 1 poisoned arrow but every level there after he gains another poisoned arrow.\nOnly on a hit the poison will be delivered and the poisoned arrow is used, as long the Elven Ranger misses (or not using his bow), he will not lose a poisoned arrow.\n\nHide in plain sight (outdoors)\n(Elven Ranger level 3)\n\nHail of arrows\n(Elven Ranger level 3)\nThe Elven Ranger shoots one arrow on every enemy in sight & in range.\nThe number of enemies shotted at is equel the Elven Rangers level.\nThis ability has 1 uses per day, but this will increase at levels 7 & 10.\n\nEvasion\n(Elven Ranger level 4)\nThis ability will improve at level 8.\n\nSwift Tracker\n(Elven Ranger level 5)\n\nUncanny Dodge\n(Elven Ranger level 6)\n\nWeapon specialisation Long Sword & Long Bow\n(Elven Ranger level 6)\nThis ability will improve at level 10.\n\nBurning arrow\n(Elven Ranger level 7)\nEvery two minutes the Elven Ranger can enlight his arrows with fire.\nThe fire damage is two times the Elven Ranger level, but a opponent can lower the fire damage with his saves and evasion feats.\nOn level 7 he has only 1 Burning arrow but every level there after he gains another Burning arrow.\nOnly on a hit the Burning arrow is used, as long the Elven Ranger misses (or not using his bow), he will not lose a Burning arrow.\n","Rating":7.22,"Votes":10,"Awards":[]},"100":{"Name":"Aribeth and Valsharesss' Armor 2.1","Author":"Nytir","Submitted":20070206,"Updated":20070705,"Category":"Armor","Patch":"1.00","Description":"Nytir's Aribeth and Valsharess Armor v2.1\nDescription\n\nLady Aribeth de Tylmarande's Armor from the original NWN and\nValsharess' Armor from the Hordes of Underdark. \nCurrently supports human, elf, half elf, halfling and plane-touched\nEnjoy!\nNote: Modified from Zylch000's base model, so thanks for that.\n\nVersion Changes\n\n\n1.0\n512 x 512 texture (the edges are pointy, not published)\n\n1.1\nReworked as 1024 x 1024 texture\n\n1.2\nAdded some details to the armor (1st release)\n\n1.3\nAdded missing UTIs\n\n2.0\n\nGot comments about blocky normals from Kolompy, turns out to be caused by \nthe enlargement of the Zylch000's 512 x 512 texture.

If you skip this step then the module may not play correctly.\n\nAdd the following scripts to the module events using the toolset:\n\nOnAcquireItem : prc_onaquire\nOnActivateItem : prc_onactivate\nOnClientEnter : prc_onenter\nOnClientLeave : prc_onleave\nOnCutsceneAbort : prc_oncutabort\nOnHeartbeat : prc_onheartbeat\nOnModuleLoad : prc_onmodload\nOnPlayerDeath : prc_ondeath\nOnPlayerDying : prc_ondying\nOnPlayerEquipItem : prc_equip\nOnPlayerLevelUp : prc_levelup\nOnPlayerRest : prc_rest\nOnPlayerRespawn : prc_onrespawn\nOnUnaquireItem : prc_onunaquire\nOnPlayerUnequipItem : prc_unequip\nOnUserDefined : prc_onuserdef\n\nIf the module already has scripts attached to events (and it probably does) then you will either need to edit those scripts and add ExecuteScript(\"prc_xxx\"); at the top of each one or make a new script that calls ExecuteScript() for both the prc script and the old event script.\n\nAdd prc_consortium.tlk to the module.

Dragoon001�s Warlock Outfit Fix or something similar is also recommended to reverse the butchery MotB did to that outfit.. Included in this update are sexier versions of the armor from Kaedrin�s PRC hak. So, obviously, you have to install the PRC hak to take advantage of this, though it works fine without it. I also highly recommend you pick up Tygaran's Sexy OC addon, as it makes the implimentation of this hak a lot easier. Everything mentioned can be found on this site. MotB is also required for the update, so if you don't have it use the old download.\n\nThere are a lot of great looking *ahem* adult haks out there for Neverwinter Nights 2. The majority of them are set up so that you can create your own items. While that's fine and dandy, if you're like me you just want to see them in game. Well, that's where this hak comes in. Basically I've gone through every armor file in the game by hand (including the ones in MotB), and replaced it with a sexier version. Just drop the items folder into your override, and you're good to go. If you get tired of looking at them, just take the folder out. It's that simple. Putting the appearance.2da file in as well will allow elves to use the armor.\n\nThat's the good news. However, there are some side effects. Armor a character starts with will be my version, but for some reason any armor found or purchased in game will be unchanged. Check out the readme for more info.\n\nIn addition to the armors is a companions folder. I�ve changed all the companions from the OC and MotB (including Bevil and Amie!) to be nude under their armor. Both genders are represented. \n\nFinally, I've included an additional folder called creatures. Included is sexier versions of the succubus and erinyes monsters. This is also where you�ll find the sexier version of the Kana NPC from Crossroads keep. You will also notice a subfolder called elementals. I�ve modified all the elementals in the game to appear as naked people. The particle effects are still there, so it doesn�t look as strange as you might think. Half are male, and half are female, though I�ve taken pains to make sure the forms available to Elanee are female (so she won�t suddenly sprout a huge dong as part of her wildshape). These are entirely optional. I'm not sure how NWN2 handles subfolders, so you may need to take the elemental folder out of creatures in order to use it.\n\nSpecial thanks to Necrolord, Chimneyfish, Zylch000, Aleanne, and Jester_v01. Without your fantastic work this mod would not have been possible. You're the talented ones, I'm just a guy with too much time on his hands.

I should mention that I have tested the current bulid of the avatar class and it can level up just fine (its spell system is based on the cleric's spell system to avoid the spell-selection bug some class designers have encountered).\n\nWARNING: Due to their being no skill packages for the Avatar class, it is recommended that, during the character creation process, you manually select all of your skills. Clicking \"Recommend\" followed by \"Next\" takes you to the final name/background/voice screen. Playing the game without having selected your avatar's spell domains has not been tested.\n\nADVICE: For maximum effect, it is recommended that you access the full breadth of your divine or infernal powers by following these simple commands when starting a new module with a new avatar character:\n\n1. In the game, press the tilde (`) key.\n2. At the prompt, type, \"DebugMode 1\" (without quotes here and after).\n3. Type \"SetCHA 25\".\n4. Type \"SetCON 25\".\n5. Type \"SetDEX 25\".\n6. Type \"SetINT 25\".\n7. Type \"SetSTR 25\".\n8. Type \"SetWIS 25\".\n9. Press the tilde (`) key again to exit the developer console.\n10. Enjoy.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Place the dialog.tlk file into your main Neverwinter Nights 2 folder (making sure to back up your old dialog.tlk file).\n2. Place the rest of the files in your Override folder (C:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\override).\n3. Fire it up and play!\n\nDescription follows.\n\nAvatar\n\nInsatiable warlords. Holy champions. Lords, kings, and emperors. Throughout history, avatars have attained great heights and great depths, but their true nature is unknown. Some sages and scholars believe that avatars are actually mortal, nothing more than heroes whose deeds have been greatly embellished or religious fanatics who have been made strong by their own righteous fervor. Yet there are those who believe the blood of gods or demons pulses through the veins of avatars. Still others--the witnesses; the worshippers, followers, servants, and slaves--claim that avatars are actually deities given flesh. None know for sure.\n\nRegardless of conjecture, there is no doubt that some men, women, and children have been called avatars, and that these individuals have exhibited powers far beyond mortal ken. Some avatars have been known to follow the teachings a patron god or goddess while others seem content sewing carnage in the name of a demon-lord. A rare few profess no belief system; fewer still claim they are all that remains of a long-lost pagan deity. Indeed, there is very little that is known, understood, or consistent among the avatars, and it is said that they make for great songs and tales if only because they themselves are made of so many half-truths, exaggerations, and downright lies.\n\nThe only certainty is that they are as varied as the stars in the heavens and the rocks in the ground. They can be any race or alignment and they are free to pursue their skills and studies as they wish, without hindrances. Such freedom, such complete and limitless freedom, is surely the result of a greater power, be it divine or infernal.\n\nClass Features:\n\nDivine or Infernal Knowledge:\n\n- Class Skills: (10+ Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 10 + Int modifier. Avatars have access to all of the non-class-specific skills (they do not have Perform or Use Magic Device).\n\n- Class Feats: Every non-class-specific feat is available to avatars upon every level-up. Furthermore, an avatar can choose three feats at every level-up.\n\n- Spells: Avatars are able to draw on vast amounts of magical energy (be it arcane, divine, or even that possessed by creatures), and they may use any spell from any level at any time. An avatar must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an avatar must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). \n\n- Domains: Avatars specialize in two areas of magical expertise called domains. These domains are selected when first becoming an avatar and cannot be changed. Domains grant added spells and sometimes a free feat or special ability.\n\n- Spontaneous Casting: An avatar can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the avatar did not prepare ahead of time. The avatar can \"lose\" any prepared spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level.\n\n- Turn Undead: Any avatar has the power to affect undead creatures (such as skeletons, zombies, ghosts, and vampires) by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol. An avatar can rebuke or destroy undead creatures.\n\n- Master Craftsman: Due to their divine or infernal understanding of the world around them, avatars have innate crafting abilities that allow them to construct arms and armor, wands, scrolls, and potions.\n\nDivine or Infernal Power:\n\n- Hit Die: d20\n\n- High Saves: Fortitude, Will, and Reflex.\n\n- Avatars may wear any armor and use any weapon or shield, and they may cast spells while wearing medium armor.\n\nDivine or Infernal Presence:\n\n- Sneak Attack: Avatars have heightened senses and highly developed reflexes; they are able to sneak attack an enemy at first level and they only grow in ability through the following nine levels.\n\n- Trapfinding: Avatars can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Avatars can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.\n\n- Trap Sense: Avatar gain an intuitive sense that alerts them to dangers from traps, and this continues to develop for the first six levels of their experience.\n\n- Dodge: An avatar can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.\n\n\n--VAGRANTS--\n\nWARNING: Vagrancy is a hard business. Damn hard. In fact, anyone in their right mind would advise you to play a better class--you know, one of those upity do-gooder paladins, or one of those fireball-tossing wizards, or even one of those snarky, pickpocketing thieves.\n\nAll right then, if you won't listen to reason, then in the very least it is recommended that you play a vagrant if and only if you meet any or (preferably) all of the following criteria:\n\n1. You have a sense of humor.\n2. You don't form strong emotional attachments to your characters and it doesn't cause you deep emotional angst watching them suffer and die. Repeatedly and often.\n3. Amendment to 1 and 2 above: You *love* watching your characters suffer and die. Repeatedly and often.\n4. You are looking for a new and innovative challenge in your CRPG experience.\n5. You are an uber 1337 H@xx0R with plenty of 5K:115 to show off.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHARACTER CREATION (for maximum vagrant effect):\n\n1. Just a reminder: the most boring fantasy race is human, the most boring skin tone is Caucasian, the most boring eye color is brown, and the most boring hair color is brown (sorry, my brown-haired peeps out there, but it's true). It might also be fun to choose the ugliest head available for your chosen race (you know the one--you could never bring yourself to select it before now).\n2. If you must select a deity and good old fashioned atheism doesn't do it for you, then Chauntea seems to be the most appropriate deity of choice. The description claims she is the patron deity of \"Agriculture, plants cultivated by humans, farmers, gardeners, summer\"--a most bland choice.\n3. For whatever reason, at the state distribution screen, if you hit the \"Recommend\" button, all of your free-to-distribute stat points disappear, leaving you with 8s in all of the stat slots. Do this. (As an added bonus, you'll only be able to choose the \"Farmer\" background--the most typical and uneventful background there is.)\n-OR-\n4. If you really want a stat rating that is reflective of a true vagrant or you can't stand watching all of those free stat points going to waste, put most of the points into Constitution. This seems deeply reflective of the vagrant's innate and most impressive ability of putting the booze away. (And anyway, the extra hit points would help an already incredibly weak character.)\n5. Use the in-game name generator to create the most bland, unimpressive name you've ever heard of. Also, it might be fun selecting the most obnoxious, grating voice there is (you know the one). For your character's background, you might consider something like the following:\n\nYashal Arna grew up on a farm where he learned to avoid hard manual labor at a young age. He had a stern father, a loving mother, and a few friends who could only barely tolerate his limitless laziness. He learned to drink when he was 16, taught himself to whistle at 17, and took to roaming at 18. Since leaving home, he's lived in poorhouses, slept in alleys, and begged for alms on street corners. He has no useful skills and alcohol has blasted most of his mind. He gets pimples on his back, cold sores on his mouth, and there's a mole on his arm the size of a gold coin. He enjoys dancing ladies and occasionally gets in pub brawls. Once, he picked a fight with the wrong bard and was hit so hard in the face that half of his teeth were knocked out.\n\nBut none of that prepared him for the day when nothing of significance happened. That's right, Yashal Arna is as plain, listless, and stupid as they come. But he's pretty content with that.\n\nTESTEMONIALS:\n\nBjorn Punyaxe says: \"Being so poor, depressed, and alone has never been so much fun!\"\n\nBollo Cowpie says: \"I start new modules with my vagrant and he dies off in a matter of minutes! It's great! No questing hassle!\"\n\nJenns Thunderbum says: \"I used to think my life sucked until I played this character class. My life still sucks, but now I get to role-play its suckiness, too!\"\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Place the dialog.tlk file into your main Neverwinter Nights 2 folder (making sure to back up your old dialog.tlk file).\n2. Place the rest of the files in your Override folder (C:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\override).\n3. Fire it up and play!\n\nDescription follows:\n\nVagrant\n\nThe dregs of society. The poor, the friendless, and the spat upon. Drunks, vagabonds, wastrels, beggars, and street urchins. Lower than the commoner and ignored by the gods, they are the last to be chosen in any game, the first to fall in any battle, and the unmemorable in any crowd. They have no impressive physical characteristics, no mind wrought from a lifetime of magical study, nor even the means whereby they might survive on the hard streets of any city, town, or hamlet.\n\nSome view these poor wretches as the offal of society, and perhaps they are, but does that mean they should not have a chance at greatness? Does that mean some high-and-mighty paladin or some war-mongering wizard is better than them? Probably. But it's about time these pathetic weaklings had a chance to rise up and go on epic quests, save kingdoms, slay dragons, and claim glittering rewards. Do they stand a chance? Probably not--but it will be fun watching them despair, suffer, and die at the hands of a world clearly built for mighty champions and legendary heroes. After all, vagrants were meant by the gods merely to sit around in pubs, drinking their life away, occasionally doling out a rat-hunting quest here or a fetch-and-deliver quest there.\n\nClass Features:\n\n- Hit Die: d4 For sudden and fearsome marauding bands of orcs, these people are always the first and easiest to cut down. Partially because they're physically useless and partially because, when danger comes bounding toward them, they do naught crap in their shoes and gawk stupidly at their attackers.\n\n- Base Attack Bonus: Low. What training have they had?\n\n- Weapon Proficiencies: Simple weapons. Cutting apples with pocket knives, working as a farmhand in the fields, and wielding ale bottles in the pubs has at least prepared them for this much action.\n\n- Armor Proficiencies: None. What use have they had for armor up until now?\n\n- Skill Points: (2+ Int Modifier x 4 at first level) 2 + Int modifier. Laziness and intellectual apathy make for horrible motivators.\n\n- Class Skills: The vagrant has a selection of the following skills, for all the good it will do him: Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Intimidate, Lore, Taunt, and Tumble.\n\n- Bonus Feats: At 5th level and every 5th level thereafter, a vagrant gets a bonus feat. These feats are useful, mostly. Well, they're better than nothing.","Rating":7.44,"Votes":6,"Awards":[]},"128":{"Name":"Arpharazon's nomap","Author":"Ar Pharazon","Submitted":20070410,"Updated":20070410,"Category":"Placeables","Patch":"1.03","Description":"If you hate the minimap when you build a maze, this little thing is for you.\n\nI made a placeable to hide in the minimap.\n\nTo use, adjust the size of the nomap placeable to the size of the area.

On such days, it much be terribly uncomfortable running around in those heavy robes everyone wears. Especially since not everyone has access to Endure Elements. :)\n\nWith that in mind, I took a stab at adapting the original clothing and armor models provided by Obsidian for greater comfort in warmer climes. Shorter skirts/kilts, no sleeves, and lower necklines certainly must be more comfortable during summer, right? \n\nFor females, I did most of this using Jester�s NWC mesh, which is excellent for making short skirts, although I used Zylch�s Female Nude Base for a couple of outfits that didn�t require skirts. For males, I did all of this using the various models provided in the Shirtless Saga Armor Pack, Volume 2 by Barrel of Monkeys and RunnerDuck. Thus far, I�ve adapted all outfits for females and clothing (but not armor) for males. Male Armor will come next (but maybe not soon).\n\nIn adapting the armor, I tried to make the armor a little skimpier while still appearing somewhat protective (with a little willing suspension of disbelief). In other words, I tried to avoid the chainmail bikini look. If you still don�t buy that the armor is protective, you don�t have to use it. It is in a separate folder from the clothing, so you can easily just put the clothing in your override directory, without using my armor adaptations.\n\nThere are two versions available:\n\n1.The Replacing version, which overrides almost all of the default Obsidian clothing and armor models with their summer counterparts. If you put this in your override directory, creatures of playable races (including your PC and companions) in every module you play (including the OC) will be dressed for summer. This may or may not be something you want, so I leave the decision to you.\n\n2.The Nonreplacing version, which allows you to use both the default Obsidian models and their summer counterparts at the same time. This could be useful if you are a module builder who wants NPC�s to change clothes with the seasons, or if you just want to use these models without affecting everything else. For builders, the non-replacing versions use toolset numbers Cloth 101 through 115, Padded 100, Leather 100 through 103, Chain Shirt 100 through 104, Scale 100 through 101, Full Plate 100 through 103, and Hide 100 through 103.\n\nRight now, the summer models exist for female humans, elves, halflings, and planetouched, and for males of ALL of the playable races (clothing only, not armor for males at this point). All but a few of the original Obsidian clothing and armor models are adapted (see below for an explanation of the exceptions). \n\nCheck the read me file for more screenshots and details on installing/using.\n\nCredits:\n· Jester�s NWC, the basis for most of the female models\n· Zylch�s Female Nude Base v0.3, the basis of a couple of the female models, and of Jester�s NWC\n· The Shirtless Saga Armor Pack, Volume 2, by Barrel of Monkeys and RunnerDuck\n· RunnerDuck�s MDB Cloner, which made doing this much, much easier (previously credited incorrectly, sorry)\n· ShadowAvatar87�s Sexy OC, which gave me the idea for this in the first place\n\nVersion Notes\nOriginal Release: just the cloth outfits\nVersion 0.2: fixed the uti files contained in the nonreplacing version\nVersion 2: redid a few of the cloth outfits using Jester�s NWC version 1.2 (much better for assymetrical outfits); full release of the armor.\nVersion 2.1 (replacing version only): fixed the ugly, unintended effects on dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs.\nVersion 3: Added male clothing, repackaged the entire project to eliminate the need for duplicate textures for the nonreplacing and replacing version and to make updating easier.\n8/16/07: if the \"flickering\" around the laces/chain links of Leather 0 and Chain 0 bothers you, I've added optional alternate versions without the laces/links.

I also added the mandolin, flute, drum, stein, ink well, lootbag, pan, pot, rake, shovel, smithyhammer, spoon and wine bottle placeables. You can also use those placeables as pickable items with proper look. There are orientations for hanging things on the wall (dn, up, dw, uw), leaning weapons etc against wall (dl, ul), and putting them flatly on the ground (fl). This can be used to replace the boring loot sacks with base item type specific model on the ground. The itemplaceablestest.7z has iptest.mod module which demonstrates that.\n\nThis system uses module unacquire script c_tk_item_placeable_mod_unacquir.nss which will automatically create the pleaceable when you drop something on the ground. Those placeables will then have OnOpen script c_tk_item_placeable_on_open.nss, OnLeftClick script c_tk_item_placeable_on_click.nss and OnUsed script c_tk_item_placeable_on_used.nss which will move the actual item from the inventory of the placeable to players inventory, and destroy the placeable.\n\nI used appearance numbers between 5000 and 5999 in the placeables.2da to make the probability of conflicts smaller.

Now there is 2 versions of the placeables.2da, placeables.2da for non MoTB use and placeables_x1.2da for MoTB version. Removed placeables.2da from the main itemplaceables.hak. Created 2 new haks, itemplaceables2da.hak (for non MoTB version of placeables.2da) and itemplaceables2da_x1.hak (for MoTB version of placeables.2da).

Unlike previous versions of this pack, the silver sword you receive will no longer be the universal sword type. Instead, it will be of whatever weapon type you picked. Remember that this does mean you will require certain proficiencies to use it now.\n\nAre you a Fighter who's specialized in Bastard Swords for your whole career who's just been given a useless Githyanki Silver Sword that won't work with your feats? Download this and fix that.\n\n\nUnlike previous versions of this pack, your silver sword will now function with all the feats that relate to that weapon type, since it is now that weapon type. This new version also no longer uses baseitems.2DA, and so it's very unlikely to conflict with any other mods you might use. To install this, just stick the unzipped folder in your override folder.\n\n\nImportant: This will work on current saved games, but only so long as you have not yet gotten the silver sword! This works for both the OC and Mask of the Betrayer versions of the sword, and can be used even if you don't have the expansion.\n\n\nAll melee weapons have been covered (I think). I also may be adding in ranged weapons, but we'll have to see how that goes. I will certainly not be adding in thrown weapons, however. They use themselves as ammo, which means you can actually lose your silver sword by throwing its last use. This was rather funny in testing, but isn't practical. Thrown weapons also can't even have half of the special properties the silver sword gets, anyway.\n\nCertain weapon types will look a little odd, by the way. Halberds and scythes will be held by the blade, for example. Also, any weapon marked with an asterisk (*) will not have the original silver sword's appearance. Because they do still have the silver sword's visual effect, these weapons will look very odd in the OC, but won't have that same look in the expansion. Uh... you'll see what I mean when you equip your dagger and suddenly a massive blade of shards appears on it.","Rating":9.96,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"165":{"Name":"Slightly improved turn undead for NWN2","Author":"HS_Tri","Submitted":20070701,"Updated":20070728,"Category":"Code Modifications","Patch":"1.06","Description":"I have made modifications to the existing Turn Undead ability in NWN2:\n- If you have 5 base ranks in the Lore skill, you get a +2 bonus to your turning check\n- Warpriest levels stack when turning undead as per PnP.\n- Support for 4 spells from Complete Champion: Light of Faith, Light of Wisdom, Light of Purity, Light of Courage\n\nLight of Faith, Light of Wisdom, Light of Purity and Light of Courage spells from Complete Champion are included.

Males use the Solar wings, females use the Kaelyn wings.\n\nBelow are the new numerical ID numbers for the wing sets:\n\n27 Human Male White\n28 Dwarven Male White\n29 Dwarven Female White\n30 Gnome Male White\n31 Gnome Female White\n32 Halforc Male White\n33 Halforc Female White\n34 Human Male Red\n35 Dwarven Male Red\n36 Dwarven Female Red\n37 Gnome Male Red\n38 Gnome Female Red\n39 Halforc Male Red\n40 Halforc Female Red\n41 Human Male Leather\n42 Human Female Leather\n43 Dwarven Male Leather\n44 Dwarven Female Leather\n45 Gnome Male Leather\n46 Gnome Female Leather\n47 Halforc Male Leather\n48 Halforc Female Leather\n49 Dwarven Male Solar\n50 Dwarven Female Solar\n51 Gnome Male Solar\n52 Gnome Female Solar\n53 Halforc Male Solar\n54 Halforc Female Solar\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nA lot of characters got the shaft when it came to getting a set of spiffy wings. I set out to solve that dilemma and came up with this pak of feathery and leathery goodness.\n\nThis set converts the Erinyes, Hezebel, and Succubus wings for each PC race and gender. When selecting the wings in the toolset, you will notice that each race has their own listing, however, it isn't exactly straight forward. The male-compatible wings of a particular race are listed by the singular version of the race name (ie. \"Dwarf\"). The females are listed by the plural form (ie. \"Dwarves\").\n\nHumans, elves (all sub-races), half-elves, halflings, Aasimars, and Tieflings all use the Human set of wings. The exception to this are the female Erinyes and Hezebel wings. The default wings for these creatures already work for the human female skeleton so no conversion was necessary.\n\nThe reason I chose this naming-scheme is because the wingmodel.2da file requires an StrRef to accurately label each set of wings. This would call for a custom TLK file and I did not want module makers to wrestle with combining my TLK with their own. You can use the set as is, or you can create your own TLK entries to use with the 2da I have in this pak.\n\nUsage (mod-maker): Include the hak-pak in the module to select the wings you want. Oddly, the wings do not appear in the toolset using just the hak-pak, but work fine in the game. If you want to see the wings in the toolset, you will need to use the Override set as well.\n\nUsage (players): Use the Override set, then use the GFFEditor to add the wings to your character. Open your character file (usually located in the localvault folder under the \"My Documents\" NeverwinterNights 2 directory) with the GFFEditor and find the \"Wings\" field. Insert the index number of the wings you want into this field and save the character. To find the index number, open the wingmodel.2da file and look at the number to the far left of the wings you want. In the 2da, the \"01\" wings are the Hezebel (white) wings, the \"02\" are the Erinyes (red) wings, and the \"03\" are the Succubus (leather) wings.\n\nThe \"Can I...?\" section:\n\nYes, do whatever you want with this pak. As mentioned below, most of the work was by Obsidian to begin with.\n\nThe \"Can you...?\" Section:\n\nProbably not. I do not do requests, but I do keep in mind suggestions made. I'm not entirely sure what possessed me to do this in the first place.\n\nDisclaimer: All models and textures are by Obsidian Entertainment. I did not create any new models or textures for this pak. I simply re-weighted the existing models to fit onto the skeletons of the other races.","Rating":9.92,"Votes":31,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"180":{"Name":"Zhjaeve Unveiled","Author":"Chimneyfish","Submitted":20070728,"Updated":20081215,"Category":"Armor","Patch":"1.06","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"* update: If you have SoZ installed, you also need to download the new appearance.2da file.

The aim of the Building Construction Kit is to provide an easy and flexible way to create large and complex structures in Neverwinter Nights 2. The dimensions of each individual part are all in integers and most of them have the same origin so that you can assemble them easily. \n\nThis package enables you to overcome limitations of the Neverwinter Nights 2 toolset. For eaxmple it allows you to create walkable platforms which can be used as ramparts, bridges and terraces. This is previously impossible. \n\nIt also enables you to create gigantic structure without scaling. Unlike scaling, you can assemble a structure of any size without worrying about overstretching the texture or scale the object out of proportion. You can scale specific parts of the building to get the proportion you like. For example if you want a steeper roof, you can scale the roof. You can build a wide range of structures with these parts such as castles, towers, ramparts, houses, bridges, churches, and labyrinths. \n\nVersion history\n1.0 First Release \n1.1 Added Round Parts and Ramp.

All description text is left visible and fully intact. \n\nNote: \n\nThis package should not be considered as entirely secure in terms of circumvention. If a player wants to see the CR's on creatures there are ways to see them with this package in use. CR's should never be visible through the course of normal play, but extraordinary measures outside of the playing environment can be taken so that CR's will be displayed as usual. To be blunt, someone who is willing to \"cheat\" can find a way around this solution.\n\nI was hoping to see the server side switch to handle this get implemented by now and not need to release this package, but it doesn't seem to be on the near horizon.\n\nHowever, I know there are many players/worlds where the players themselves are happy to have the CR's removed and would welcome a system that removes the CR's while leaving descriptions available. Even if you don't want to see the CR's it's difficult to ignore them in glowing colour when looking at a creature's description. With No Con 2 you can safely read creature descriptions without seeing the technicolour CR's.\n\nKnown Issues: \n\nUsing the \"Default Action: Examine\" option in the toolset for placeable objects can break the examine text for that placeable. You can use the onclick or onuse event to assign an examine action instead. If the player has the \"Auto-set target with Action\" option set, then the examine text will be fine. It's only if the placeable is set to the default action of examine and the player has auto-set target off that this will be an issue. Basically, it's because I need to find the kind of object that is being examined so I can adjust the examine screen accordingly, and the default action examine doesn't require a target object selection. (i.e. you can have something else up in the examine window while triggering the examine event on a default action examine placeable). \n\nExamining a spell from the spellbook will break the examine text if a creature is selected at the same time. Another version of the issue listed above as the spell is not set to the object selection when examined. Don't examine spells from the spellbook with a creature selected. Examining spells from the quickcast does, however, display full examine text normally even if a creature is selected. \n\nHaving certain .ini file debug settings set may break some examine text if in windowed mode. Hehe, I just spent over an hour tring to figure out why it seemed like the system just suddenly stopped working. I had DebugMode and Debug Text set in my nwn.ini in the \\My Docs. I think they were both on, but the problem wasn't resolved until I deleted those entries from that nwn.ini file. Just a FYI and it's only when in windowed mode as fullscreen rendered normally even with those ini settings.\n\nHeed House 2\n","Rating":8.5,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"188":{"Name":"Patsy's & Sunlee�s Monsters","Author":"cacysunlee","Submitted":20070810,"Updated":20080120,"Category":"Creatures","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Patsy's & Sunlee�s Monsters\n\nTextures are in cooperation with deviantART maestro Mr. Patsy Broeselreim.\n\nVersion 1.1 - Tiger, German Dog and Piglet added\nVersion 1.0 � Adamantit, Magma, Ice, Silver\n\nfeatures : \n- the monsters don't replace the original monsters\n- the erf file have samples of monsters, they aren't according to any rules\n- magma, ice and adamantit golem are with glowmaps, take a look at night\n- the monsters are tintable\n\n\noverride install : \n- extract the file in your MyDocuments/Neverwinternights2/Override folder\n- import the erf in your module and find new monster in ps_monsters\n\nuninstall : \ndelete the extracted �Patsy Sunlee Monster� folder \n\n\n- if you want to see more of our work, then vote\nhave fun","Rating":9.02,"Votes":14,"Awards":[]},"189":{"Name":"Crafting Hammer Modification for Sexy OC","Author":"mr_bumpkin","Submitted":20070814,"Updated":20071010,"Category":"Armor","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is a modification I made for ShadowAvatar's Sexy OC hak so you can choose what armors you do and do not want to apply the Sexy OC changes to. \n\nIf you use the crafting hammer on an armor or character wearing armor (instead of on the crafting bench, as it's intended to be used), it will apply the Sexy OC changes to them.

This beast is nearly the size of a Nessian Warhound and has the fiendish benefits of being a Blackguard's servant. It is a 12 HD creature with an 18 Spell Resistance and Damage Reduction 10/Magic. By virtue of it's increased size and strength it also wears a chain shirt as barding like the Nessian Warhound increasing it's survivability greatly. It's bite deals 2d6 damage plus d8 in fire damage along with the usual strength bonus. The servant is immune to fire. While a hell hound has a natural 50% vulnerability to cold, being a fiendish servant of the Blackguard has granted the hound a 10/- resistance to cold to minimize their vulnerability.\n\nFuture Update:\n\nGiven the Nessian Warhound is generally equipped with a +2 Chain Shirt as armor, I'm looking at a minor Blackguard crafting system that will allow them to add a higher +enhance bonus on their servants armor as well as possibly some damage resistances.\n\nI'm also looking at further scaling the pet for epic character levels (21-30). Without Epic Blackguard and the Epic Fiendish Servant feat the pet is too weak for epic levels.\n\nIf PW/Module developers are interested in an upgraded pet for Blackguards but properly based on the Improved Fiendish Servant feat(the current upgrade) or the Epic Fiendish Servant feat (coming upgrade) I'll be happy to do so. Otherwise I'll leave it as a drop in upgrade for single player use.\n\nThis link used to be the stand alone version of the Blackguard/Assassin upgrade but with MotB and my drastic cleanup of the changes I decided to change this to the pet only.","Rating":9.67,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"195":{"Name":"Combat Companions","Author":"Night_wolf","Submitted":20070822,"Updated":20070822,"Category":"Other","Patch":"1.06","Description":"First... this is a beta...voting is optional, opinions are desired.\n\nThis is a simple add on for animal comapanions adding 2 extra wolves that are more combat capable than the ones already in game.

We've got five years of solid experience from the NWN1 Avlis project and we are using the lessons learned there to jumpstart Avlis: Seven Cities. We've listened to our playerbase and have thought up creative ways address the important issues and introduce new content not previously available. For example, on Avlis 2 we have 9 uniquely designed, dynamic creature races. The Avlis: Seven Cities setting begins with Crosstreams and the surrounding areas. The city is the central capitol of the Seven Cities confederacy and a cosmopolitan mix of races from across the world. To truly reflect the variety offered in Crosstreams our team has created these 9 dynamic creature races for our players: \n\nPixies \nSidvhan (Avlis-specific Fey race) \nHalf-orcs (Re-modeled) \nOrcs \nHalf-Ogres \nOgres \nShaahesk (Lizardmen) \nDrangonari (Elven sub-race) \nGhost Elves (Elven sub-race)\nWe want to give special thanks to Camb for his initiative in pushing the NWN2 engine to the limit to make the head and dynamic armor models functional and Buddha for jumping in and learning how NWN2 .2da and tlk files worked to get them into the game and for creating the unique race banners and icons. \n\nCome visit Avlis: Seven Cities where the common monster races are anything but common!\nInstructions\nOVERRIDE PACK INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nDownload the .rar or .zip file. Extract it into your override directory located in C:\\Documents and Settings\\Your User Name\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\override. Begin a new game and you will see three new available races on startup: Reptilian, Fey and Ogre. Selecting one of these as your race will get you Lizardfolk, Pixie or Ogre respectively as your subrace. Create your character, start the module, and have fun! \n\nFAQ \nQ: Can I use this override in conjunction with other modules besides the Original Campaign?\nA: Most times. Because this pack uses the override directory, it will not function properly if you use it with a module that has haks attached containing any of the following files: appearance.2da, feat.2da, racialtypes.2da, racialsubtypes.2da \n\nQ: My ogre won't sit down! What gives? \nA: Because Camb put these together before the Expotron plugin, the new races do not possess a complete set of PC animations, so not all emotes will function. If you have skills with Granny/Expotron, we'd love to see these guys get the full treatment! \n\nQ: Why are some of the descriptions ... less than descriptive? \nA: In order to make this a pure override pack, we forwent using a custom tlk file. As a result, we were limited to lines that already existed in Obs standard dialog.tlk. We've done our best to make them as descriptive as possible, but we had to operate within the limitations of what was already in there.\n\nQ: Why is this set up as an override, and not as a hak that I can attach to my module?\nA: Our target audience with this release are those that want to develop the dynamic armor and head models further (say with animations) or those that don't have toolset skills -- that simply want to play with a custom race. By making it an override package, it will get the most enjoyment from the broadest audience at this point.\nCaveat Emptor: We believe, in general, hak format is far superior to override format, and that is what we will have on Avlis 2. Consider this a sneak peek and a development package.\n\n\nQ: I am upgrading from a previous release date. How do I do that?\nA: Since this is an override at the moment, just delete the old folder that contains this package (not the whole override folder, but whatever folder you put INSIDE your override folder to contain this particular package). Put in the updated version. All done.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This override package is a way to get the dynamic armor and head models for these monster races out to the public. They are NOT set up as they will be in Avlis 2. In the Seven Cities these are members of a much larger society, and don't always conform exactly to their stereotypes. The Avlis 2 versions will have different abilities, descriptions, etc. and a custom tlk.\n\n=================\n1.12 Update Notes\nFor this update, we've removed the two non-functional natural armor feats for Ogre and Lizardman. The A2 answer for this is a scripted system that will not work in override. Instead, we've elected to use Toughness for this override as a free feat for these two races to represent their extra thick hide.\n\nAlso, these three races still lack some animations. This is most noticeable when you begin MotB and should be in the \"lying down\" postion, but instead are standing. Any animators that want to take a hack at this are still welcome to try.\n\nSoZ 1.22 Update Notes\nThese files are now updated to function with SoZ patch 1.22. We're unable to test them with previous patches and expansions, so they may or may not work if you don't have SoZ or 1.22. We welcome feedback, though!\n\nHAK INSTRUCTIONS\nNow with more cowbell! Ok, no cowbell, really. This is simply the same files as the override pack in a hak format for builders. If you don't know what a hak is or what it does, download the other file. ATTENTION PWs: If you attempt to use these races in hak format, you will not succeed (in a multiplayer, online environment) unless one of two conditions exist. 1) Obsidian patches the game so that haks load before character creation in multiplayer, or 2) You have some custom way to load haks prior to character generation.\n","Rating":9.92,"Votes":46,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"197":{"Name":"Zpirit's Crystal Pack","Author":"zpirit","Submitted":20070826,"Updated":20071023,"Category":"Combos - Placeables","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"4 dyeable models of crystal without walkmesh(convert to enviromental object and use walkmesh cutter).\n\ntexture 512x512pix\n\nNow for one not much experienced builder with placeable.2da compatible with MOTB.\n\n","Rating":9.75,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"198":{"Name":"Subraces Pak Beta","Author":"Soul Filcher","Submitted":20070828,"Updated":20070911,"Category":"Races","Patch":"1.06","Description":"This pak adds several races to the game.

It can contain several files of different type which a module creator wish to distribute with her/his module. The *.hak files need to be placed into the hak folder and then be associated with the module via the Module�s properties dialog. Afterwards, the contents of the hakpak are available both in toolset and game.\n\nERF stands for Encapsulate Resource File. It is used when importing and exporting resources from one module to another. Most people keep .erf files in a folder in their My Documents folder called erf. Note that you don't get an erf folder by default, so feel free to created one when you need it. \n\nThe Override folder is used to override files in the original game. When a modified file are placed in it the game will use this file before the original file with the same name. Builders often use this folder during development of new content, before putting it into a HAK-file. \nCareless use of the override folder can cause problems with the game.\n\n\n*** Version history ***","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"203":{"Name":"TKL Cardgame","Author":"brockfanning","Submitted":20070906,"Updated":20080122,"Category":"Other","Forum Thread":"Link","Patch":"1.10","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"TKL (The Known Lands) Cardgame v2 \n\nThis is a system for... you guessed it... playing cards!

Compare this to how many with all 10 levels taken. Many people consider it not worth going all the way with Blackgaurd.\n\nThis mod aims to improve the Blackguard by beefing up the fiendish summons he gets. Prior to level 10 he gets the standard Dire Rat.\n\nHowever, at level 10 depending on his alignment he gets a new summon:\n\nLawful Evil: Calls forth a huge hellhound. This beast is tough and a good melee fighter.\nNeutral Evil: A Dark Stalker is summoned which uses stealth and sneak attacks to take down your foes.\nChaotic Evil: A dark succubus is summoned to rain down fire and ice upon your foes.\nGood and Neutral: You summon the deadly dire chicken. This is actually sent as punishment to those who dare to leave the dark path but still try and call upon its powers.\n\nUSE: Drop the files into your override folder (cant imagine it conflicting with anything that exists to-date but if you have anything else that modifies blackguard fiendish summons then it naturally will conflict).\nNow create a level 10 blackguard in your favorite leveling mod and test it out.\n\nBUGS: This is a BETA for sure. I know of several problems already. However, some of these problems may be related to the unpatched nature of my game.\n\n1) (minor bug) The NE summon uses the githyanki base model with the animus elemental effect. However, sometimes the portrait does not apply the effect therefore the summon doesnt look exactly like its portrait.\n2) (major bug) For some reason the summons dont seem to equip their weapons that are equipped in the toolset. This is a real problem for the NE summon. If anyone knows what is going wrong here i would love to know.\n3) (strange bug) I found that if i summoned a creature, and then afterwards changed alignment, then the next creature i summoned would sometimes default to the chicken. Would be interested to know if anyone else experiences this. To be safe make sure your alignment is what you want it to be before doing the summon.\n\nFUTURE:\nAt the moment no README and no test Blackguard character included. If i can iron the bugs out then will do this for the final release. Also the summons need balancing but until i can iron the bugs out this is a secondary concern for the moment.\n\nFEEDBACK:\nI would love feedback, constructive criticism, and ideas on how to solve the bugs. Please dont say patch... ive been down this road before several times and being on dial up its not fun. Will wait for MotB and get the base game updated that way.\nAlso let me know if you find any other bugs.

I'm deeply disturbed by their staff's continued actions and frankly with some of the player base of that server that is also on other servers with my content that has no trouble with their actions.\n\nThis change means that new content will not be available on the nwn2 builder site or on my personal site or released to the public (nwvault, nwn nexus).\n\nA few of the incidents can be read about at these links: Link , Link , and Link\n\nThese are quotes from Rasael, the developer on BG responsible for this:\n\n We certainly don't intend to copy your designs, not soley because you don't want us to but also because it simply wouldn't work for our hobby here.\n\n Your designs are meant for generic settings with a higher base powerlevel. Our designs are meant for a low power environment in the Sword Coast region of Faerun. Those two don't match, meaning that inspiration is the most a design proposal from your pack can ever be.\n\n If you really don't want it to happen put a big notice about that on the design page that others may not reproduce (e.a. copy) it and don't make it publically available.\n\nThis is a summation of what I tried to tell Luna in the BG thread linked above:\n\n I left the server in the past with no ill will to the server, just a disagreement with how things were done. I'm 100% ok with the server changing anything/everything that is in the 1.41.4 update. I do NOT want anything after 1.41.4 to be used by the server. It's that simple.\n\nand Luna's (the server admin) response:\n\n I'm not going to enforce this. Neither will TheVoid or Maecius.\n\n v1.42.1 is publicly posted on nwn2 vault.\n\n If any player or developer wants to look at, talk about, or use the content of that version, I don't see any reason to stop them. Your work is sitting out there in the public domain for public usage.\n\nYet Rasael recently stated the following in response to an announcement that I'll be stopping public work:\n\n Secondly, Baldurs Gate has never made use of any idea not publicized on the internet by its author without his permission.\n\nThen on December 31st they posted a server update ( Link ) that includes 7 of my 100% custom, not based on pnp in any way, feats.\n\nSo the only way for me to actually stop them from continuing to take content against my permission is to stop doing public content. That means single players and the NWN2DB builder will no longer be getting my updates.\n\nIt's been a long, eventful five and a half years and I'd like to thank the community for their support on this project while it lasted. It's been a great experience.

These new textures look great but unfortunately the \n\nnew colors do NOT match ANY of the previous user made addons that show skin. WHY BREAK OUR STUFF!?!?! Anyway I decided to fix \n\nthe problem.

The SexyOC installation was complicated and anything but Elegant. I have included \n\nsub-folders in the \"Texture Updates\" folder. Each sub-folder includes texture files that MUST overwrite their Identically \n\nnamed counterpart that was installed with the various packages.\n\nOptional Installation Instructions For v0.99:\nKaelyn can now have a matching Face & Body Color. However it is not as simple as just adding her texture to the \"SexyOC Faces\" \n\nfolder. Yes first extract her texture from the sub-folder \"Kaelyn\" and place it in Overide/SexyOC Faces along with the others.\nNEXT you will need GFFEditor. If Kaelyn has joined your party. The file \"ROS-dove.ros\" will be located in your save game \n\nfolder. Open \"ROS-dove.ros\" with GFFEditor. Expand then scroll down until you see the entry \"Tint_Head\". Expand that and add \n\nthe entries shown in the \"Kaelyn_Tint.jpg\" included with this download. Click File & Save. Kaelyn should now have skin color \n\nto match her face.\n\nCredits:\nThe fixes for \"United Colors\" and \"appearance.2da\" where not my discovery.\nCredit goes to those various posters who shared their comments with us about the various addons.\nThe textures where not not my creations.

Having a hard time giving your NPC a voice?\n\nThis package fixes the sound set selection menu in the toolset by activating over 120 sound sets that could not be heard until now as well as by marking another 120 or so sound sets as non-existing in NWN2/MotB.\n\nNon-existing entries have been relabelled with the �zz#� prefix so that they appear at the bottom of the selection menu. \"Partially\" working sound sets have been prefixed with \"zz!\". The other non-audible sound sets were fixed so they now can be sampled in the TS.\n\n----\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n- There are now two versions of the package: one if you own only MotB and one if you have both expansions. Each version includes:\n\n * A �TS sound set selection menu fix� folder that contains:\n . A new soundset.2da (either based on the MotB or SoZ original file)\n . 127 fixed sound set files (SSF)\n \n * A ReadMe (this text, plus a more in-depth description of the issues and fixes)\n\n * An Excel worksheet in 2da-like format that shows what errors were found and what was done to fix them.\n\n----\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n-Place the �MotB - TS sound set selection menu fix� or \"SoZ - TS sound set selection menu fix� folder in your MyDocuments override folder. Make sure you have no other soundset.2da file in any of your override folders.\n\n-This �TS sound set selection menu fix� folder only need to be present in override when you are building in the TS. As the new soundest.2da does not delete or add any entries or rearrange their order in any way but only modifies LABELs and some RESREFs and STRREFs for the benefit of working in the TS, the 2DA does not need to be distributed with your mod. The new SSF files do not need to be distributed either, as their original versions apparently work fine in game.\n\n-Since no other change has been made to soundset.2da, previously assigned sound sets in an existing mod should not be altered when using this package (however, if a previously assigned sound set is actually one that does not exist, it will take on the new LABEL with the zz# prefix, but only while the the fixed soundset.2da is present in override.)\n\n-If you experience any issues or have any concerns regarding this package, please email me at ecpatterson@sympatico.ca so that I can address them rapidly. \n\n-Once you've tried this package, please don't forget to comment and vote.\n\n----\n\nVERSION NOTES:\n\nv1.1 - Released separate versions for MotB and SoZ. The contents of the MotB version are identical to v1.0. The SoZ version added 24 entries representing the SoZ's new soundsets to soundset.2da.\n\nv1.0 - Original release\n\n----\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\n- Depending on the version you use, you should have MotB or both MotB and SoZ installed.\n\n----\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\n-MotB version: Compatible with MotB v1.10 to v1.21.\n-MotB+SoZ version: Compatible with MoTB+SoZ v1.21.\n\n----\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS:\n\n- tazpn for SSF Utility, which made the job of fixing sound sets much quicker.\n- Squeeself for SSFEditor, which was indispensable to diagnose the various problems early on.\n- The Gaming Parents Studios gang and community members on the NWN2 Bioware forums for their help and encouragements.\n\n----\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nOnly those files that did not produce any sound when the \"Play\" button was pressed in the TS were looked at and \"fixed\". There do however exist other sound sets that sample fine in the TS but that nonetheless contain errors (e.g. some references to non-existing WAVs, much like the #3 category above).The \"OrcChf\" and \"OrcWiz\" sound sets are examples of this. Fixing these sounds sets was not part of the scope of this particular package.\n\n----\n\nCONTACT:\n\necpatterson@sympatico.ca\n","Rating":9.68,"Votes":26,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"273":{"Name":"Non-scrolling over-the-head text (NWN1 style)","Author":"Viconius","Submitted":20071213,"Updated":20071214,"Category":"Other","Patch":"1.11","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"Thanks to GrinningFool and Laban, who discovered this while doing some font related editing. \n\nI always felt the floating moving over-the-head text in NWN2 was too restless and harder to read than static text in NWN1.

They are capable of disabling or even slaying an opponent with a few precise strikes. They are masters of unarmed combat, misdirection, and fighting on their terms. The Hidden Fist are scholars and catalogers of the vital systems and weaknesses of all manner of humanoids, beasts, and other more exotic creatures. They endure intense study and physical training to hone their minds and bodies to a razor edge. Disciples of the Hidden Fist are most commonly employed assassins and spies but their talents make them suitable for a wide range of situations.\n\nClass Features:\n- Alignment Restrictions: Any Non-Good.\n\n- Hit Die: d6\n\n- Base Attack Bonus: Medium.\n\n- High Saves: Reflex.\n\n- Weapon Proficiencies: None. The Hidden Fist disdain the use of weapons of any kind.\n\n- Armor Proficiencies: None. The Hidden Fist do not train in the use of armor. However, armor skills may be acquired later. A Disciple of the Hidden Fist may use Monk equipment and Items\n\n- Skill Points: 4 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.\n\n- Class Skills: Bluff, Craft Alchemy, Craft Trap, Disable Device, Hide, Intimidate, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Open Locks, Parry, Set Trap, Spot, Taunt, and Tumble.\n\n-Primary Ability Score: Dexterity. Secondary: Intelligence \n\n-Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, a Disciple of the Hidden Fist gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.\n\n-Unarmed Damage: A Hidden Fist�s unarmed follows the same progression as a standard Monk. \n\n- Flurry of Blows: When unarmored, the Hidden Fist may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. When reaching the 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. \n\n- Sneak Attack: If a Disciple of the Hidden Fist can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two levels thereafter.\n\n-Disarm: A Disciple of the Hidden Fist gains Disarm as a bonus feat at first level.\n\n- Evasion: A Disciple of the Hidden Fist of 2nd level or higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a Disciple of the Hidden Fist is wearing light armor or no armor.\n\n-Dodge: The Hidden Fist gain Dodge as a bonus feat at 3rd level.\n\n- Ki Strike: At 4th level, a Disciple of the Hidden Fist�s unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character's monk level, becoming lawful for purposes of damage reduction at level 10 and adamantine for purposes of damage reduction at level 16.\n\n\n- Special Abilities: On attaining 4th level, and at every five levels thereafter (9th, 14th, and 19th), a Disciple of the Hidden Fist gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.\n\n***Begin Special Abilities***\n\n - Still Touch: The Disciple of the Hidden Fist makes a melee touch attack to a pressure point on his opponent paralyzing them for half his level in rounds. If a critical hit is scored the effect becomes indefinate (untill saved against). The victim is allowed a Fortitude save at the onset and every round after to negate the effect. The DC for this check is 10 + half the Hidden Fist�s level + the Hidden Fists Intelligence Modifier. This ability may be used an unlimited number of times per day but is on a 12 second cooldown timer. This ability does not work against creatures immune to paralysis.\n\n - Rest in Peace: The Disciple of the Hidden Fist makes a melee touch attack to a pressure point on his opponent putting them in a comatose state for half his level in rounds. If a critical hit is scored the effect becomes indefinate (until woken up). The victim is allowed a Will save at onset to negate the effect. The DC for this check is 10 + half the Hidden Fist�s level + the Hidden Fists Intelligence Modifier. This ability may be used an unlimited number of times per day but is on a 12 second timer. This ability does not work against creatures immune to sleep or mind-effects.\n\n - Eye Gouge: The Disciple of the Hidden Fist makes a melee touch attack grievously wounding the eyes of his opponent blinding them for half his level in rounds. If a critical hit is scored the effect becomes indefinate (until rested or restoration is cast). The victim is allowed a Reflex save at onset to negate the effect. The DC for this check is 10 + half the Hidden Fist�s level + the Hidden Fists Intelligence Modifier. This ability may be used an unlimited number of times per day but is on a 12 second timer. This ability does not work against Elementals or Constructs.\n\n - Crippling Strike: A Disciple of the Hidden Fist with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. \n\n - Improved Evasion: This ability works like evasion, except that while a Disciple of the Hidden Fist still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball, henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. \n\n - Opportunist: A Disciple of the Hidden Fist automatically gains a +4 competence bonus to attack rolls when making an attack of opportunity.\n\n - Feat: A Disciple of the Hidden Fist may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.\n\n***End Special Abilities***\n\n-Feint: At 6th level a Disciple of the Hidden Fist gains Feint as bonus feat.\n\n- Uncanny Dodge: Starting at 8th level, a Disciple of the Hidden Fist can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.\n\n-Greater Flurry of Blows: At 11th level a Disciple of the Hidden Fist get 2 additional attacks when using Flurry of blows. This replaces the single additional attack granted by Flurry of Blows.\n\n-Improved Disarm: At 11th level the Hidden Fist gain Improved Disarm as a bonus feat.\n\n- Improved Uncanny Dodge: At 13th level a Disciple of the Hidden Fist cannot be sneaked attacked unless the attacker has at least four more levels than the target.\n\n-Feint Mastery: At 16th level a Disciple of the Hidden Fist gains Feint Mastery as bonus feat.\n\n-Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique: At 18th level a Disciple of the Hidden Fist learns the secret Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. To execute this complex maneuver the disciple must succeed in 6 successive melee touch attacks. If successful the victim dies (no save). If the victims racial type differs from that of his attacker, the disciple must make a check of 10 + his intelligence modifier to see if he landed the strikes correctly. This ability may be used once per day. The Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique does not work against undead, elementals, or constructs.\n\n-Epic Disciple of the Hidden Fist: At epic levels Death Attack replaces Sneak Attack every odd level. A bonus feat is attained at levels 25 and 30. This feat may be used to acquire remaining special abilities.\n\n","Rating":7.5,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"285":{"Name":"Dragonkin  (with additional specialized armor options)","Author":"Camb","Submitted":20071228,"Updated":20090509,"Category":"Creatures","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Concept (and motivation, ideas and endless brainstorming) by Zarvhak. Adds a new creature race (not playable) called Dragonkin to the game. \n\nThere are two 2DA files both with one additional line each very well padded, so very easy to merge with other packages. Explaining how to merge 2DA files is beyond the scope of this submission, but searching for it on the neverwinter night forums or the vault here should turn up plenty of results. The creature race's body is human, with 2DA-driven additions such as custom-fit wings (from whatbrick's Wing's Galore) and tails. The heads are simply the four OEI dragon heads scaled and skinned to the human skeleton (also 2DA driven), then tweaked a bit to make male/female differences.\n\nThe creatures are fully tintable, as is their special armor that shows some scaley skin (you can use ANY armor humans use, including any new armor that comes out, these are simply additional custom made armors for this race). To give them body scale armor/clothing options, I had to clone and retexture 8 of the human models (four for males, four for females). I appended the models with the unused numbers 71 to 73 depending on the armor (corresponds to 01 to 03, so for example P_HHF_CH_Body72.mdb is a modified clone of P_HHF_CH_Body02.mdb). There were some tweaks involved in the body models to make the parts that were supposed to be scaley skin look like skin. Most of the body work was getting the texturing correct.\n\nInstall Instructions FOR HAK VERSION\n1: Extract the \"dragonkin_v1-22.hak\" file into your \"hak\" directory (.../My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/hak).\n\n2: If you are a builder and you want this hak required for your module then assign it via the Module Properties and be sure to give players access to the required hak.\n\nHow to use the Custom Dragonkin Armorsets\nOption 1: In the toolset (in a module with the hak installed) select the dragonkin who's armor you would like to change. In the properties window go to the Armor Set tab. For the \"Main Type\" select from either Default (clothe), Chain Shirt, Leather or Full Plate. For the \"Main Variation\" select the armor number that STARTS with a \"7\" (71 for example). That's it! Just change the rest of the settings for the other armor peices as you see fit.\n\nOption 2: Make a copy of an armor type in the armor blueprints. Select your copy. Use the steps in Option 1. Give your dragonkin his/her new armor item via their equipment tab and equip it. That's it.\n\nNOTE: you probably don't want non-dragonkin getting a hold of that armor you just made, so make sure it's not droppable or pickpocketable, and don't give it away in treasure chests.\n\n---------------------- \nCamb: Developer for Avlis 2 and Rogue Dao Studios\nCamb's Other Submissions","Rating":9.82,"Votes":28,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"286":{"Name":"ROBOTS","Author":"Yaddaman","Submitted":20071229,"Updated":20090707,"Category":"Creatures","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"They are finally here!

Besides this one, there are two other \"Samurai\" classes available, however the others simply try and use existing skills to make up for the lack of actual samurai abilities.

It's usable from level 1, the reasoning for this is that the intimidate skill was meant to be used as such. You can technically add it to every class if you wanted, but that would take some work I'm not willing to do.\n\nKnown Issues:\nThe smite ability does not work as a proper smite, it simply adds the bonuses for 1 round, meaning you can actually waste your smite if you're not careful. You also have to cast it.\n\nThe Staredown and Frightful Presence feats are actually just the Skill Focus: Intimidate, and War Priest's Fear Aura. However, these \"placeholder\" feats are very similar to the samurai feats and should do for now. In future updates I will have proper feats for these.

It may take a while for me to get everything running again. \nAll of this content is available through the NWN2 toolset. The heads are available at character creation. To access the new weapons and armor, you have to make the item in the toolset. \nI might be able to explain another way to get items in game when I have time to figure it out after my computer is fixed. Some of the heads have a high number of polys (especially Sion's head!). It didn't really seem to affect my game, but I don't recommend putting an army of Darth Sions in one area. \nHere's the lowdown:\nHuman head #45- Darth Revan head with cybernetic eye (converted from KoTOR but heavily modified by me.

These are not official classes by any means but rather products of my demented imagination. I felt the drive to create them as they are truly classes that I would like to play. I hope that at least a few of you will enjoy them as well.\n\nThe Man of Two Arms class is the answer to the need for a strength based Dual-Wielder. Let me try and describe the concept I used to inspire this class's design. Remember in the Bruce Campbell flick �Army of Darkness� when he rigs up his defunct car with blades attached to the crankshaft and then drives around mowing over any sorry undead in his path? Ya, that�s the concept. \n\nThe Disciple of the Hidden Fist is essentially a Sneak Attack Monk or an Unarmed Rogue depending on how you look at it. This class has a ton of activated abilities and should be a lot of fun for those who enjoy micro-management (I know I do). This is an update from a previous release of mine where the DotHF class had to overwrite Monks or the Sacred Fist PrC to work properly. Through perseverance and massive amounts of scripting I have made the DotHF class stand alone! Hopefully this will greatly add to its appeal.\n\n********************\n\nClass Descriptions - \n\n---Man of Two Arms---\n\nThe Men of Two Arms are warriors who live and die clutching a weapon in each fist. It is said that they are never to be found with out their two fighting instruments readied. A Man of Two Arms considers each of his two weapons an extension of his own body. He relentlessly trains in a two-weapon fighting style that embraces might above all else. He considers the largest of weapons the most effective and strives to obtain the strength to wield them in each hand with finesse. The Men of Two arms are fierce combatants who inspire dread in all opponents they face bearing down upon them from two directions in a fury of heavy steal.\n\n------\n\n---Disciple of the Hidden Fist---\n\nThe Disciples of the Hidden Fist are a sect of monks that train in the deadly arts of Dim Mak. They are capable of disabling or even slaying an opponent with a few precise strikes. They are masters of unarmed combat, misdirection, and fighting on their terms. The Hidden Fist are scholars and catalogers of the vital systems and weaknesses of all manner of humanoids, beasts, and other more exotic creatures. They endure intense study and physical training to hone their minds and bodies to a razor edge. Disciples of the Hidden Fist are most commonly employed assassins and spies but their talents make them suitable for a wide range of situations.\n\n------\n\nFor a complete description of class abilities see the 2d2f_class_abilities.txt downloadable below.\n\n********************\n\nA note on functionality - \n\nThe persistent feats uses for both classes in this pack benefit if the module you are playing in sends equip and unequip triggers. This is based on the system Kaedrin uses and if his stuff works mine should also. For the Man of two arms class I have included a feat (MoTA Feat Trigger) that can be used to activate his persistent abilities if needed. If you find yourself needing to use this feat try to remember to activate it when ever you equip, unequip, or change weapons to get the correct benefits.\n\n********************\n\nInstallation - \n\nSee the 2d2f_installation.txt downloadable below.\n\n********************\n\nStatus - \n\nCurrently two versions are available:\n\n1. A standalone version.\n2. Ladydesire has a version of her classpack that includes my classes, as well as many other class mods from around the community. Go to her page and download the file �ldcp1.01_k133.7z�. \n\nJust remember to come back and comment/vote if you like my classes.\n\nLadydesire's Classpack v1.01\n\n********************\n\nUpdates -\n\n1.1 - Replaced obsolete DotHF dialog.tlk entries. Also fix some of the rampant typos in the class descriptions.\n1.2 - 03-22-08 - Updated standalone version to patch 1.12. Also, since the pack has not received any bug reports since release it is officially out of beta.\n1.3 � 08-14-08 � Updated to the 1.13 patch.\n1.4 � 10-28-08 � Fixed Swiftness of strikes. (LD note: made changes to 2d2f_dothf_swiftness_of_strikes.nss) and deleted an extraneous 2d2f_misc_functions.nss from the 2d2f_feats folder.\n\n********************\n\nFeedback-\n\nIf you use this mod I would like to hear what you think of it. I am willing to consider implementing tweaks or improvements suggested by users but I will hesitate to change anything that alters the general flavor of these classes. Also, any bug reports are extremely helpful in the process of weeding them out. \n\n********************\n\nFuture releases � \n\nWell the wild mage is done. However, I just got a new computer and am playing a lot of other games. Never fear I still love NWN2 and will be doing some more stuff in the future probably when MoW and the next expansion come out.\n\nI am still heavily involved creating the Wild Mage class from 2nd edition. I expect it will be finished less than another month.\n\nAfter the wild mage class I will be converting the homebrew class pack over to the PRG format. I for one welcome our new PRG overlords.\n\nAfter that I will work on a couple PrC�s and see where it goes from there. The PrC�s I plan on doing are�\nThe Enlightened fist and a custom PrC called a Gnosis Stalker.\n\nNo one seemed to like my True Alchemist Idea so it is officially scrapped. Not worth doing it if no one will play it.\n\nPlease suggest any class ideas you may want implemented. If it floats my boat, I may just make it!\n\n********************\n\nSpecial Thanks -\n\nKaedrin - My unknowing collaborator =). Thank you for providing such an awesome collection of work. I have learned a great deal from studying ( err ripping off ) your scripts.\n\nLadydesire - Her works are also a source of inspiration. Thanks for putting together a merged release. The community desperately needs this.\n\nThe PRC - An awesome group with outstanding tutorials. Once they get there stuff ready for NWN2� watch out.\n\nNWN Lexicon - Absolutely necessary.

The package contains building parts ranging from floorboards, staircases, walls, doorways, windows to rooftops. The dimensions of each individual building part are all in integers. You can assemble them easily. You can build a wide range of structures with BCKII such as castles, towers, ramparts, houses, and bridges. It is previously very difficult to build explorative structures of such scale with the Neverwinter Nights 2 toolset. It is because most official buildings are designed as standalone objects that cannot be entered or climbed. \n\nBuilding Construction Kit II (BCKII) is similar to Building Construction Kit (BCK) but better. The models are better textured, more detailed and more architecturally accurate. Larger parts are also available to shorten build time. I no longer try to fit several architectural styles into a single package like I did with BCK. \n\nI generalized what can be generalized in a generic package.

The aim is to provide sitting functionality similar to that of NWN1 in NWN2. It comes with a custom placeable blueprint seat that actually does all of the work. The custom placeable is a simple model used to represent a place to sit. This placeable coupled with some sort of object can then be used to create sitting spots. The package comes with prefabs for all standard seat objects (chairs, stools, benches), so creating spots to sit is very simple -- place down a prefab. Only the custom seat object itself is interacted with, so the actual models for chairs, stools, bnenches, etc. are set to be environmental objects. If not using a prefab, then you can place your seats where desired and set the accompanying object as an environmental object.\n\nThe seat placeable bakes into the walkmesh by cutting a square around itself which cannot be pathed through, but it leaves a walkable area in the centre. What this means is that the seat is solid in-game and cannot be walked through, but if an object is jumped to its location it can be placed squarely in the centre. Sometimes you may want to use a walkmesh cutter instead of having many seats each individually bake down. This is perfectly fine if done properly so as to leave walkable areas at the seat's location but not allow pathing through them (open the demo module in the toolset to see examples). \n\nTo sit down a player simply needs to click on a seat object. The player with pathfind (walk) to the seat, decide to either stand in front or behind the seat, assume the correct orientation, play a sitting in a chair animation and jump to the seats location. A small GUI icon appears on the players screen which is used (clicked on) to cancel the sitting operation and return to a standing position. Also, a player can change seats while sitting: if already seated and another seat within range is clicked on the player will cancel the current sit action, stand up, path to the new seat and sit. \n\nAll races will sit at the same height. This means only one standard is needed for a seat's height and its corresponding object's scale. The seat placeable's visible geometry sits just above this height, so you can easily measure if your environmental object is scaled properly by placing a seat object near or on it. In other words, a halfling and a half orc can both sit in the same sized seat.\n\nIf a player crashed or logs out while sitting in a seat that seat will not become invalid or \"unsittable\".\n\nHeed's ActionSit Seat Tool:\n\nThis toolset plugin is provided with the package in order to ease and simplify the workflow when working with seats. The system works by baking the seat objects, but then removing the static property on the seats so they can be used (clicked on in-game). This means when you bake your area you want all seats set to static first, but after baking your area you need to set all seats to non-static. The plugin handles this workflow for you. By selecting the Run checkbox and then clicking on the Bake button all seats in the open area are set to static and the area is baked. You then need to click the Save button to set all seats in the area to non-static and save the module. The area and module are now ready for use. Sometimes you will want to use a walkmesh cutter instead of the seat's walkmesh and in these cases you select the seats and click the Bake/NoBake button. You don't need to only select the seats themselves -- you can just draw a selection box as the plugin will sort, find and only operate on seats. Clicking the button will change the seat's tag so it is ignored by the Bake and Save operations and also set it's properties to be non-static. If you find you want to use the seat's walkmesh again, then just select the seats again and hit the Bake/NoBake button again.\n\nIf you make changes to an area conataining seats that requires a rebake, remember to use the plugin to bake that area following the correct workflow. If baking manually (no Run checkbox selected) , then you still need to use the plugin to set the seats, but you must then bake the area as you would normally from the File menu. You also must remember to use the Save button after baking manually in order to set seats to be useable in-game -- don't forget to save your mod or area after doing so.\n\nBasic Workflow:\n\n1) Place prefabs seats along with any tables, etc.\n\n2) Launch the plugin.\n\n3) Select the Run checkbox and hit the Bake button. \n\n4) Check all tiles baked properly. If not, reposition or switch some seats to be NoBake and use a walkmesh cutter. \n\n5) Repeat step four until the area bakes properly.\n\n6) Hit the Save button with the Run checkbox selected.\n\n7) The area is now ready for use and your module has been saved.\n\nVersion 1.1:\n\nForgot to include the sit animations for dwarves -- files now added to the hak. Apologies to all the stout hearted little buddies out there. :) \n\nFiles changed: Heed_ActionSit.hak -- just replace the v1.0 of the hak with the hak in this package -- no need to reimport the erf or anything.\n\nVersion 1.2: \n\nUpdate to workaround an engine bug with PlayCustomAnimation() whereby only other players in the same area as the sitter would see the animation playing. The animation is now called every 12 seconds while seated in order to update PC's who move into the area of the sitter.\n\nFiles Changed: Heed_ActionSit.hak (updated the GUI), Heed_ActionSit.erf (updated gui script) and Heed_ActionSit_Demo.mod.\n\nReplace hak with hak from this package. Builders, import the .erf from this package overwriting gui_hss_actionsit.nss.\n\nVersion 1.4:\n\nFixed bug where you could jump to unpathable seats.\n\nSit action can now be canceled en route by cancelling the moveto action\nfrom the action queue. \n\nFiles Changed:\n\ngui_hss_actionsit and Heed_ActionSit_Demo.mod.\n\nImport the .erf, overwrite gui_hss_actionsit and compile.\n\nThanks to Viconius for the bug reports.

Balanced several variations. Did not update Q or the Hex Me at this point, will when I add content from the next update. A quick note, lots of changes all fast like render me memory loss, but you surprises! No there good ones I promise, just look at it from over here.\n\nThis is a simple mod. It's substance is in it's simpleness, adding the unique 'feel' without the disconnected mind. They all use the default NWN2:MotB blueprints, and all Armor variants are cloth according to game rules. This way, any class can integrate them as the mood takes you. Obsidian, Atari, Wizards of the Coast have made a incredible Toolkit that has given shape to this mod through and through. Thanks for the hard work!\n\nI have made Q. Q is a reference for everything this mod has, in-game. Now you don't have to do or remember anything other than checking with Q for the file I.D.\n\n I update from time to time with new stuff, and am open to hear requests or comments. I make mistakes, so if you notice something irregular, ask about it here. All will be included in the following update. Or edit anything in the Toolset. \n\nLastly, there is a link to the NWN2 User Screenshots area where I've posted several pics of this content. You may find it a good reference, or fun to look at =)\nThe link is in the Forum bar, just above the description for this mod.\n\nSo enjoi, immerse, and do with these as you see fit!\n\n\n----------------------------------------\nUpdate History\n\nv. 1.0\n- First submission\n\nv. 1.01\n- Updated HexMe, this page, Item stats, pix, Hex files\n\nv. 1.02\n- Added new Armor/Weapons/Items, tweaked existing variants, updated HexMe and this page, Added Pix\n\nv. 1.03\n- corrected file duplication in Hex Files, updated HexMe, this page with update history and whats to come.\n\nv. 1.04\n- added two new armor variants; The Black Pride of the War King and Cloth of the Priest, updated HexMe and Tome with with ID references, altered existing variants;\n*A.O.

All IDs for files are names listed here with no spaces, heading zq_ or hex_ for nonenhanced. ex. zq_shadowarmor\n\nv. 1.06\n- Add lots of weapons, from bow to bastardsword, greatsword to knife, and other. Every item added with this update (I noted it in the HexMe) has an unenhanced counterpart. / updated all other variatns with little tweaks or minor changes, This page will only host in pix what was recently added, save for a couple that maybe influential to you, All content referencing will now exclusively be in HexMe (I can't do that to this page, it would be as much a nightmare to you as to me, as to admins. SIMPLIFY! Go read HexMe for oodles of good rhetoric, vainities, and critical information.\n\n*Please delete my old files since I've added subfolders and it wont overwrite by default. I included everything so you wont lose files in the process.\n\nv. 1.07\n**Highlights of this update includes 7 new items.

It's a splurge by excretion (a thing I will delete soon I'm sure due to a stench of frustration only imperfection can lend with time), a direct result of ingested information of various kinds mixing over a period of time that forces their sudden projecting onto random objects where I find purpose or relevance in course of my writing.

They say a kid found an ancient tome in the bellows of an abandoned library, called a 'book' , in the tongue of that people. It's only rumor since he's suddenly 'disappeared', but supposedly it was titled \"So you pay to much for Videogames?\" and gave any whom just kept it in their inventory +50 INT ! Skills like Patience and Temperance were supposedly also granted, but there was no references to what these skills 'do', if they 'do' anything. I don't believe in books personally, just the game gods. They have magic swords, fairy tales have cute morals with a hard throw of relativity. Catch all that?

Changes noted below.\n\nThis version of the mod is for people who DO NOT use Reeron's pack. If you do use Reeron's pack, see the comments for the work by Pleasework to make the two compatible.\n\nThis mod is an attempt to make the druid's wildshapes more balanced and interesting. It completely disregards PnP rules.\n\nMajor Changes:\n\n1. Shapes no longer ignore physical stats. Gone are the days of druids having three dump stats. Instead, each shape allows the druid to replace one ability score with his wisdom score, as well as conferring other abilities. The +12 to stats limit is still in place, so druids with more than 12 difference between their wisdom scores and the stat being mimicked will see a disparity.\n\nUPDATE: Racial adjustments are now maintained while shapeshifting.\n\n2. Natural Spell only works in some shapes. Shapes that can cast receive natural spell automatically. A version of the druid's feat list is included that grants natural spell automatically, in order to prevent you from taking it by accident.\n\nUPDATE: Epic druids can cast in any form.\n\n3. Wildshape features are dependent on total level, not druid levels. Druids also receive their first use of wildshape at level 3, and one additional use every odd level. This makes more multiclass wildshape builds possible.\n\n4. Properties of all items from all slots are merged when transforming into an animal.\n\nUPDATE: Including bracers.\n\nThe shapes:\n\nBear shape: Bears use their wisdom in place of their strength. They also gain a BAB equal to their level.\n\nBoar shape: Boars are pure toughness. They use their wisdom in place of their constitution. Boars also have the highest natural AC and natural damage reduction.\n\nBadger shape: The druid transforms into a small furry mammal and attempts to escape the notice of his enemies. The druid gains a sanctuary effect with DC equal to 12+WIS (i.e. as if it were a second level spell). This increases to 16+WIS at level 12. I wish this were rat or bat shape, but I'm not going to go messing with .tlk files.\n\nUPDATE: The DC is now 1/2 level +10, to a maximum of 20, plus your wisdom bonus.\n\nWolf shape: The wolf uses his wisdom score in place of his dexterity. He gains weapon finesse and track as bonus feats. He also gains bonuses to hide, move silently, spot, listen, and track as if they were maxed out class skills. Lastly, he gains sneak attack progression as a rogue of equal level, up to 10d6.\n\nShambling Mound: The druid becomes a mass of sentient vines covered with poisonous thorns. He uses his wisdom score in place of his dexterity score, and throws poisonous darts that cause wounding and slowness in his enemies. If they get too close, he ensnares them in his tangle.\n\nUPDATE: The poison thorn now merges your ammo properties if you have a missile weapon equipped.\n\nTreant: The treant is the first shape that the druid can cast in. It uses its wisdom score in place of its constitution, and gains powerful immunities to magic, martial attacks, and the elements. However, it is almost completely rooted in place and moves at greatly reduced speed.\n\nIf you are using my druid feat override, you will receive magical beast wildshape automatically at level 21. All magical beasts can cast spells, and also provide powerful auras to their allies.\n\nUPDATE: Auras now actually work.\n\nWinter Wolf: All allies receive bonuses to their attack, damage, and speed. The additional damage is cold damage.\n\nCelestial Leopard: All allies receive bonuses to their saves and AC, as well as regeneration.\n\nPhase Spider: The druid and all allies become ethereal.\n\nUPDATE: The Phase Spider exudes an aura that causes negative levels on enemies who fail a will save.\n\nMinor changes:\n\nThere is a druid skills 2da included that adds hide and move silently to the druid's skill list. Nature in general and plants specifically are often associated with stealth, and the druid receives spells and abilities (including a feat that is effectively \"Ignore medium armor penalties outdoors\"), so it seemed like a natural fit. This makes the druid the only stealthy divine caster in the game.\n\nThe druid receives low light vision, natural spell, and creature weapon proficiency automatically at level 3.\n\nUPDATE: The druid no longer has access to creature weapon feats. Weapon feats do not seem to affect polymorphed creatures, so it was basically a waste.\n\nSacred fist code of conduct will be corrected for, but the creature weapons will not count as unarmed weapons for purposes of the attack bonuses provided by that class.\n\nThere is an optional script that will allow flame weapon to also work on ranged weapons.\n\nIs it balanced?\n\nI think so. Essentially the druid exchanges spellcasting, access to his inventory, and the use of activated abilities in order to mimic the abilities of another class. However, monk druids can now use wisdom as their defensive stat as well as attack stat, with a choice between full BAB and sneak attack progression. I haven't tried it, but I suspect monk/druids are severely overpowered using this pack, so fair warning.","Rating":8.42,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"336":{"Name":"Atoms Armory","Author":"AtomAction","Submitted":20080422,"Updated":20080714,"Category":"Combos - Armor","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is my first mod after being inspired by Hexidous and his Wardrobe mod.

Please pay him your respect. ~2DruNk2FraG\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Wild Mage is a new class for Neverwinter Nights 2 ® based on the class of the same name from the 2nd edition Tome of Magic. The Wild Mage is a wizard who utilizes a new experimental method of spell casting that is powerful, unpredictable, and often dangerous. Conceived from nostalgia and born through countless hours of scripting our Wild Mage has grown into a truly substantial body of work. Shazbotian and I hope that you will enjoy playing this unique and fun class. The primary features of this mod are; \n1) The playable Wild Mage Class,\n2) a completely reworked spell casting system to implement wild magic,\n3) 28 Wild Magic spells exclusive to the Wild Mage Class, and\n4) a highly detailed wild surge table with 100 dazzling, bizarre, and unexpected results.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Wild Mage Class\n\nOne of the newest discoveries from the great lands of the Forgotten Realms is wild magic. Originally considered little more than the unfortunate by-product of an epic struggle among the gods of that world, the strange effects of the wild lands (as those areas affected by wild magic are known) have attracted the attention of many a curious or scholarly wizard.\n\nWith the discovery of wild magic has come the appearance of wizards devoted to its study. Like their traditional specialist brethren, wild mages have thrown themselves into the intense study of a single aspect of magic. This has given them unique benefits and restrictions on their powers. Wild magic is so different from traditional magic that only those devoted to its study may cast wild magic; no wizard other than a wild mage may attempt to use the spells of wild magic.\n\nIn general, two types of wizards are drawn to these strange areas. The first are the researchers: wizards devoted to the study of the theoretical underpinnings of magic. For them, the wild areas expose long-hidden secrets of the magical universe and give new insights into how magical energy functions. From their work have evolved the beginnings of a theory of random magic-one that defies the traditional schools.\n\nThe second type of wizard drawn to the wild lands is far less rigorous and methodical. These spellcasters are attracted by the sheer randomness and uncertainty of the wild lands. Such mages seek to incorporate wild magic into their spells by combining traditional magic with the new theories of random magic, throwing in a dose of their own chaotic natures as an extra measure. These wizards are the true wild mages who have been seen recently in various lands.\n\nRequirements\n\nRace: Only races competent in the arcane arts may become Wild Mages. This includes Humans, Half-Elves, Sun-Elves, Moon-Elves, Drow, all types of the Planetouched, and Gnomes.\n\nAlignment: Any. Although wild magic is chaotic on the surface, study in this field requires diligence and discipline.\n\nAttributes: Intelligence of 16 or greater. The theories of wild magic are breaking new ground, and only characters of high intelligence are able to decipher the arcane convolutions of its meta-mathematical theory.\n\nSpellcasting: Must Be a Generalist Wizard of no greater than or less than level 2*. The study of wild magic must begin early in a Wizards career. Once a wizard has set foot on the path of wild magic the newfound knowledge makes an indelible mark on their minds. A Wild Mage can not unlearn the secrets of the weave and thus can never return to the path of ordinary Wizardry.\n\n*Originally, the intention was to make the Wild Mage a base class as it is presented in the Tome of Magic. However, due to limitations in the NWN2 engine this was impossible. The best compromise was to make them an �Extended PrC� that begins at level 3 and may progress all the way to 30th level.\n\nClass Features\n\n- Hit Die: d4\n\n- Base Attack Bonus: Low.\n\n- High Saves: Will\n\n- Weapon Proficiencies: Wild Mages gain no additional weapon proficiencies.\n\n- Armor Proficiencies: Wild Mages gain no additional armor proficiencies.\n\n- Skill Points: 2 + Int Modifier.\n\n- Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Lore, and Spellcraft.\n\n- Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new Wild Mage level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as though he had gained a level in Wizard. Wild Mage arcane spell progression cannot be applied to other classes, such as sorcerers or bards.\n\n- Wild Magic Spells: Becoming a Wild Mage grants access to the spells of wild magic. Only Wild Mages of appropriate level may cast wild magic spells. \n\n- Bonus Spell Slots: Like a specialist wizard, Wild mages are able to memorize one extra spell per level. This spell must be a wild magic spell, although it can be from any school.\n\n- The Gift of Inspiration I - VII: Wild Mages strive to be on the cutting edge of wild magic spell research. When becoming a first and second level Wild Mage (total level 3 and 4 including 2 levels of Wizard) the caster gains a rush of inspiration that lets them quickly transcribe two Wild Magic spells from level 1 and/or level 2. Thereafter, when gaining a new level the Wild Mage experiences a renewed sense of inspiration and may select an additional spell from their current casting level or less to transcribe. This ability is highly beneficial to the Wild Mage as scrolls containing wild magic spells are not to be found anywhere but in the cold dead hands of another Wild Mage. It is recommended that these transcribed spells are immediately scribed into the player�s spellbook for posterity; however the player may do as he wishes with them. The Gift of Inspiration must be used before a new spell level is gained or its benefits will be lost. To use The Gift of Inspiration activate the feat and select a spell from the dialog.\n\n- Chaotic Mind: All Wild Mages posses a certain affinity for magical items that rely on random chance such as a Rod of Wonder or a Deck of Illusions. When using such an item the Wild Mage will be presented with two random outcomes from which they may choose. Chaotic Mind has no effect on unique artifacts of unfathomable power such as a Deck of Many things.\n\n\n- Spell Level Variation: The most broad-reaching aspect of the wild mage's powers is his approach to spells. The wild mage's work with the principles of uncertainty affects all spells that have a level variable for range, duration, area of effect, or damage. Each time a wild mage uses a spell with a level variable, he randomly determines the resulting casting level of the spell. The spell may function at lesser, equal, or greater effect than normal. The degree of variation depends on the true level of the caster as shown in Table 1 (see Manual). The entries in bold indicate that a wild surge has occurred.\n\n- Wild Surge: A wild surge briefly opens a doorway through which raw magical energy pours. The energy is incompletely controlled by the actions of the spellcaster. The result, often spectacular, is seldom what the caster intended and is sometimes a smaller or greater version of the desired spell. At other times, wildly improbable results occur. Songs may fill the air, people might appear out of nowhere, or the floor may become a pool of grease. Whatever happens, it is the essence of wildness.\n\n- Bonus Feats: At 3rd, 8th, 13th, and 18th level, a Wild Mage gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The Wild Mage must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.\n\n- Epic Wild Mage: An epic Wild Mage gains bonus feats as a wizard of the same level.\n\n See the manual for additional information.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpell Summary\n\nLevel 0 � \n\nRandom Spell 0 � Casts a randomly selected 1st level spell at the target.\n\nLevel 1 � \n\nNahal�s Reckless Dweomer � Attempt to cast any known spell with an extremely high probability of a wild surge happening instead of what is intended.\n\nScatterport � Teleports target a short distance in a random direction. Can be used on friendly or hostile targets.\n\nRandom Spell I � Casts a randomly selected 2nd or 3rd level spell at the target.\n\nLevel 2- \n\nChaos Shield � This spell negates the effects of a single wild surge on the caster.\n\nPhase Affliction � Causes randomly selected areas of the target�s body to phase out each round. Items equipped on the specific area to fall off as well as some additional positive and negative effects depending on the phased area. \n\nOrganic Un-Wounding � Target returns to a bodily state before they were injured. The process induces paralysis for 7 rounds.\n\nRandom Spell II � Casts a randomly selected 3rd or 4th level spell at the target.\n\nLevel 3 � \n\nHornung�s Baneful Deflector � Incoming projectiles, including spell projectiles such as Magic Missile and Flame Arrow, are deflected and strike a randomly selected nearby target.\n\nRandom Spell III � Casts a randomly selected 4th or 5th level spell at the target.\n\nVile Word of Discord � Caster speaks the most unspeakable, the raunchiest of the raunchy, and the unholiest of unholy insults at a hostile target. All intelligent creatures nearby who hear the insult respond with their first inclination whether it be rage, uncontrollable laughter, or other response (determined randomly). \n\nPaithan�s Lucky Streak � Target gets a random bonus each round from 0-3 on attack, saves, skills, ac, and surge modifier. 5% chance the spell ends each round, 5% chance of receiving a -1 penalty instead of a bonus, and a 5% chance of getting a double bonus (+6). Spell continues indefinitely, but the average length will be 2 minutes. \n\nLevel 4 � \n\nPaithan�s Fiasco � Opposite of Paithan�s Lucky Streak.\n\nNahal�s Magical Propensity Modifier � Target receives a modifier to their next spell save. The modifiers is a random number between + or - the casters level. This value is rolled twice; enemies take the worst of the two, allies take the higher.\n\nGlyph of Wild Magic � A Glyph placed on the ground triggers a wild surge at everyone within its area of effect once triggered.\n\nRandom Spell III � Casts a randomly selected 5th or 6th level spell at the target\n\nLevel 5 � \n\nDiscombobulation � The targets ability scores are randomly shuffled.\n\nVortex � The casters familiar is transformed into a difficult to control vortex of raw magical energy. The vortex does 1d4 magical damage to normal creatures or 1d6 damage to magical creatures and casters per level of the wild mage. There is a 5% chance on every hit that the vortex explodes into a wild surge.\n\nLevel 6 � \n\nDysmorphigation � Target is polymorphed into a random form. Possible forms vary greatly in power level from chickens to dragons.\n\nWildstrike � All spells cast by the target trigger wild surges.\n\nErratic Essence Exchanger � All creatures within the area of effect receive the current hit points of another randomly selected creature in the area.\n\nLevel 7 � \n\nSpell Shape � Caster absorbs magical spell energy directed at them and may shape it into a memorized spell of their choice targeting the original caster. This spell is not forgotten.\n\nMass Magical Propensity Modifier � As the 4th level spell except it effects all creatures in the area of effect, all spell saves are affected for the duration, and a new modifier is rolled each round.\n\nHornung�s Surge Selecter � If a surge happens, the caster rolls twice and may select the surge of his choice.\n\nLevel 8 � \n\nWildzone � Creates a huge area in which all cast spells result in a wild surge.\n\nWildstorm � Creates an intentional tear in the weave causing powerful random positive and negative effects to be applied to everyone in the area. The Wild Mage has small measure of control which effects are applied to enemies and to his allies. This control improves greatly in epic levels. \n\nLevel 9 � \n\nStabilize � Negates all wild surges and Wild Mage spell level variations for those within its area of effect. Trying to combine this spell with Nahal�s Reckless Dweomer or Wildfire creates a paradox that cancels stabilize and puts the casters health at serious risk.\n\nWildfire � The Wild Mage may attempt to cast any spell, including divine spells and invocations, with an extremely high probability of a wild surge happening instead of what is intended. At level 21+ epic spells may be attempted.\n\n See the manual for complete spell descriptions.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSystem requirements\n\n1-Neverwinter Nights 2, Mask of the Betrayer, and Storm of Zehir updated to the current patch.\n2-An archive extraction tool such as WinRar or 7-zip.\n3-~150 megabytes hard drive space.\n\nInstallation\n\n1-Download the Wild Mage class files.\n2-It is recommended that you remove all existing files from your �My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/override� directory or that you rename your old override directory and create a new one to house the Wild Mage files. (See ompatibility section for explanation)\n3-Extract all files to your �My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/override� directory.\n4-Move the �dialog.tlk� from your �My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/override� to the �My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2� root directory. Remember to back up any existing �dialog.tlk� file that is currently there.\n5-Move the �ingameguix2� file to the �My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/ui/default� directory. Remember to back up any existing �ingameguix1� file that is currently there.\n\nCompatibility\n\nIt is recommended that you remove all existing files from your override directory or that you rename your old override directory and create a new one to house the Wild Mage files.\nThe compatibility of the Wild Mage class mod is limited. In its creation, a great deal of files common to many community made mods were modified. However, great care has been taken to ensure that this mod will work with the OC, MotB, SOZ and most (if not all) community made modules. That said, some modules will need tweaking for the wild mage to function properly.\nCompatibility is important and it is our desire to make the Wild Mage class useable with all modules and as much community content as possible. If the class is not working properly in a module you wish to play, please notify Artemis Absinth in the comments section on the Vault page and steps may be taken to correct the problem. Additionally, please post any custom content you wish to be made compatible and it will be assessed for integration.\nYou may try and use community made content but as a rule of thumb if it shares any files with those in the Wild Mage class mod there is likely to be major issues. These files will need to be merged. Unfortunately, this means that any other class mods, spell improvements, and many GUI mods will not work. However, excluding the said categories, the majority of community content will work. As time goes on these incompatibilities will be addressed and improved upon. Check the Vault page frequently for new compatibility news.\n\nKnown Compatible Custom Content: The following mods have been assessed and/or tested of compatibility. If you have tried a mod and it works, let us know!\n\nTonyK�s AI,United Colors, Rod of Prepairation, Companion Multi-class, Easy Suppres, Charlies UI, and Tygaran's SexyOC Reloaded.\n\nRelease Status\n\n1.0 Beta - Initial Release.\n\n1.1Beta - 07-06-08 - Improved/fixed half a dozen surges and removed some debug statements.\n\n1.2Beta � 08-14-08 � Updated to the 1.13 patch.

The manual has not been updated.\n\n1.3 Beta � 09-11-08 � 1) Fixed Nahal�s Reckless Dweomer so that it could not be used by other characters. 2) Fixed the spell selection bug with Arcane Sorcerer of Candle Keep and other casting prestige classes. 3) Fixed several issues with the Deck of many things. 4) Other small bug fixes. 5) Updated Manual. 6) Thanks to Marc_al for reporting many of these issues.\n\n2.0 beta - 8/27/2011 - Updated by Artemis Absinth for SOZ.

It is purely a roleplay-aid and/or outlet for musical creativity. Here is a summary of what you can do with TKL Performer: \n\n-Play: The Lute has 2 full octaves of plucked notes, in 'normal' and 'muted', plus 36 chords (12 major, 12 minor, 12 diminished), in 'normal' and 'rolled'. The Drum has 1 full octave of pitched percussion, plus two variations each of cow bell, taiko, triangle, guiro, frame drum, open snare, closed snare, tabla, tambourine, and anvil; in 'normal' and 'loud'. The Flute has 2 full octaves of notes, in 'normal' and 'short'. \n\n-Sing: Prepare lyrics for 'click-to-sing' performances. \n\n-Save: Save/Load your own complete songs, with up to 4 tracks of music, plus lyrics. \n\n-Record: Record music and/or lyrics in real-time. (*Requires NWNX4 with 'Timer' plugin) \n\n-Write: Produce tracks using a 'text-to-music' system. \n\n-Tweak: Edit pitch, timing, variation, delete notes, change the speed and key of your song, and copy/move/split/merge/quantize tracks. \n\n-Publish: Distribute your songs in-game, as musical scores for other performers to learn from, or as lyric-sheets for audience sing-a-longs. \n\n-Perform: Playback your completed song, with music and lyrics, for all the nearby PCs to enjoy!\n\nThere is a Help document with FAQ available in-game. Questions, feedback, and bug reports are welcome! \n\nNEW IN VERSION 2\n\n-Improvisation: An easy way to instantly create a full song in one of 10 styles, with any 4-track instrumentation. The Improvise button is found in the main song menu.\n\n-Write sequences now support repeats and beat division, and can be of unlimited length. Percussion 'variation' numbers (1 or 2) are now optional. Details can be found in the in-game help.\n\n-Lyric tracks can now be entered using the same 'Write' system as music tracks.\n\n-Blueprint Scores: Songs can now be created using Write sequences in the Toolset, as item blueprints. Details can be found in the included 'blueprint_scores_readme.txt' file.\n\n-NPC Performers: An included conversation allows NPCs to perform, using improvisation, blueprint scores, and any song saved by a DM. NPCs can also transcribe a score of any song they play.\n\n-Embellish Chords: New button in the Edit window allows PCs to quickly add notes to existing chords.\n\n-Adjust pitch by scale tone: In addition to adjusting pitches by half-step, you can now adjust them by scale-tone.\n\n-Adjust timing by beats: In addition to adjusting timing by seconds, you can now adjust them by beats.\n\n-Duplicate Notes: New button in the Edit window allows PCs to quickly make a copy of the current note.\n\n-Copy screen reworked: 'Copy From' and 'Paste To' are now called 'Start Point' and 'Time Change', which can now accept negative values, and can be adjusted by beats, in addition to seconds.\n\n-Bass drum, udu, qandahar changed to cowbell, triangle, and guiro. All drums have been amplified.\n\n-Score are now weightless.\n\n-DMs can 'throw' lyrics to any (currently selected) NPC, and DMs can change the original composer of a song when they rename it.\n\n-Maximum simultaneous sounds increased to 15 (in prioritygroups.2da)\n\n-Demo module included\n\nUSING TKL PERFORMER IN LOCAL MODULES - OVERRIDE VERSION\n\nTo use TKL Performer locally, you can download the Override version. Unzip the file in your MyDocuments/NeverwinterNights2/override directory. While you are playing any module locally, equipping a flute, lute, or drum, will launch TKL Performer.\n\nINSTALLING TKL PERFORMER IN YOUR MODULE\n\nNOTE: If you are upgrading from version 1, you may want to rename your 'tkl_performer_settings' script before importing the new version, so you can copy any custom changes to the new version of that script. \n\n1. Choose the correct .erf file for your server: \n-If you are running NWNX4 with the 'Timer' plugin, import 'tkl_performer_WeRunNWNX4.erf' \n-If you are NOT running NWNX4 with the 'Timer' plugin, import 'tkl_performer_WeDoNotRunNWNX4.erf' (this contains a dummy version of 'nwnx_timer' to allow scripts to compile) \n\n2. Place the NPC bard in any taverns/inns, if you would like.\n\n3. Download the 'tkl_performer.hak' file and associate it with your module in Module Properties. Distribute it to all your players. \n\n4. Optional (highly recommended): Download and distribute the prioritygroups.2da file for players to put in their Override directories. (This dramatically improves the sound of TKL Performer, but sadly it doesn't work from hak files and must be put into the Override directory. Thankfully it is a pretty obscure 2da file so it's unlikely anyone else uses it.) \n\n5. Configure your preferences in the 'tkl_performer_settings' script, if desired. Afterwards, make sure to 'Compile All Scripts In Module'.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR DMs\n\nIn TKL Performer v2, all DMs share the same list of saved songs. This allows all DM-saved songs to be accessed by the NPC performers, but it has the drawback that DMs do not get their own list of saved songs. So it is very important, if you have any songs saved with your DM avatar, that you transcribe them to scores BEFORE installing this update, and don't forget to export your character. ONCE THIS UPDATE IS INSTALLED, DMs WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR PREVIOUSLY SAVED SONGS, EXCEPT THROUGH INVENTORY SCORES OR INSTRUMENTS. \n\nBUGS\n\nVersion 2 was only lightly play-tested, so please let me know if you find any bugs or issues.\n\nCREDITS \n\nThanks to Tygermoon, El Yimbo, Nevyn, and the players of The Known Lands PW, for their playtesting, feedback, and ideas! Thanks to Papillon and nwnx.org for providing NWNX4 and the timer plugin! Finally, thanks to East West Quantum Leap for the flute and drum samples! \n\nFeel free to contact me: brockfanning@gmail.com\n","Rating":9.99,"Votes":31,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"355":{"Name":"Tintable Red Wizard Robe","Author":"GodBeastX","Submitted":20080707,"Updated":20090205,"Category":"Armor","Patch":"1.21","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is the Red Wizard robe made tintable.\n\n2DA made separate.

Pack","Author":"SushiSquid","Submitted":20080713,"Updated":20080825,"Category":"Prestige Classes","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"Let's start with what you all care about most: this pack replaces the game's slings with hand cannons. Yes, you can now use a gun. Enjoy them. I know I have been.\n\nThis also adds in the new Sniper prestige class. Sniper is, at heart, a ranged version of the weapon master, and for weapon of choice you may pick from hand cannon, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, longbow, or short bow. The main change is that the mostly-useless Ki Damage was replaced with my new feat Ki Focus, which makes taking all ten sniper levels easily worthwhile. The requirements for the class are also different and easier to achieve.\n\nI've also created custom icons for hand cannons to use, but because UTI files save their icon data within them and the game's stores keep UTI data within them... well, I had to be tricky to make these work. The result is that any time a new item enters your inventory that uses one of the old icons, it is instead deleted and instantly replaced with an identical item that uses my new icons. Don't worry about this happening to them again: the new ones use a different resource reference, so feel free to enchant your hand cannons without worry. You'll still see sling icons (all the text works, though) in stores or anywhere else, but they'll get firearm icons as soon as they hit your inventory. Check the included Readme file for information on what items will be fixed.\n\n\n\nThink ranged combat sucks in NWN2? You're right. I've tried to alleviate that with this pack. Hand Cannons will add some minor power increases if you choose to use them (1d10 18-20 x2 Exotic weapon), but the Sniper class will importantly give you increased critical threat range and damage, as well as Ki Focus for some added power and accuracy. Ranged combat will still be nowhere near as strong as melee, but at least this helps a little.\n\n\n***INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS***\nStick dialog.TLK into My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2 (not the override folder). Then stick the Sniper folder into the override folder from there. Yes, this will work with currently saved games.\n\n*** It's important to note that this pack was made for use in the OC and Mask of the Betrayer and should function perfectly with them. Using it with other modules may cause conflicts with that module's .hak file, if it has one. Modules that use campaign data or override material may also produce conflicts. If you're having issues with this pack and you're not playing the OC or Mask, then try removing the pack. This shouldn't be an issue for most modules available on the Vault, but certainly will be with some.\n\n\n***Special Thanks***\nMWMDragon, who actually made the arquebus model I'm using. You may find that here in .hak form.\n\nAdam Miller and his Dark Waters series, from which I got the idea as well as from which I am using the cannon ball this gun fires as well as the sound it makes. If you haven't played these excellent modules, then go download them here and here. Then you can be looking forward to the third one as much as I am.*\n\n\n*Do not use my gun pack while playing Dark Waters. I... well, I honestly don't know what sorts of shenanigans will happen, but I doubt it would be good. Remove my gun pack when playing Dark Waters or other modules that modify the same files this pack does.\n\n\n***Note to MWMDragon and Adam Miller:***\nIf you want your content removed, just say the word. I doubt MWMDragon minds me using his wonderful gun model since that's why I'd assume he uploaded it, but if he doesn't want this, I'll remove this pack and hope for someone else to model a gun for me so I can re-release this. If Adam Miller doesn't want me using his cannon ball model or sounds, I'll remove them, probably just leaving the gun to fire rocks (which is barely noticeable) while finding new gun sounds somewhere online.\n\nBasically, I am assuming that anything available for download here on the Vault is free-game to use (I feel that way about everything I've ever uploaded to here), but I will remove your content if you ask, and for any reason.\n\n\n***Recent Updates:***\nv1.05 Split\nYou can now download just the guns or just the prestige classes. The combined file is identical to the previous version.\n\nv1.05\nAnother prestige class was thrown in now. I'm mostly testing the waters to see how much interest is generated and gauge whether making more classes is worth my time, so let me know what you think. The arcane summoner prestige class is now included, and helps improve the otherwise weak summoning magic of wizards and sorcerers. Its also unique in that your familiar continues to improve in this prestige class, and even gains more power.","Rating":9.79,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"359":{"Name":"There be boulders . . . Giants throwing Boulders  v1.2","Author":"Shaughn78","Submitted":20080715,"Updated":20110307,"Category":"Creatures","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"There be boulders in the air.\n\nNow giants can throw boulders and crush their opponents from a distance.\n\nCreated for the Risen Hero Campaign, here is a shameless plug for my blog: Link\n\nIn addition to boulder throwing you will also get your own copy of the Risen Hero Hill Giant (who just happens to look a lot like a giant half-orc)\n\nEach giant will now throw up to 3 boulders at an opponent at least 10 feet (or 3 meters) from them. The attack will use a touch range attack and allow for a reflex save to reduce the damage. A check has also been placed to allow different giants to do additional damage. Using the d20 system fire giants do an additional 2d6 of fire damage. Currently it is dissabled but frost giants can do the same cold damage.\n\nI have included two files to download a Hak and an override. \nBoth include a .erf, that contains the three scripts needed and the three giants with all applied scripts and variables.\nThe Hak file also includes: a Hak file with the visual effects and the spells.2da as well as a module with everything already applied used for testing.\nThe override file includes: a folder to place in the override folder that has the visual effects and 2da. It also includes a module with the imported .erf for testing.\n\nFor giants to throw boulders both the three scripts and giant blueprints with the applied scripts and variables need to be imported into the module/campaign. Placing files into the override file will not cause giants to throw boulders by themselves. The global blueprints for the fire and frost giant will not throw boulders only the imported giants in either the module or campaign. New encounters will also need to be created as the the standard ones use the global giants.\n\nAlso the spell.2da uses the custom spell for the boulder throwing on line 9300. This is a reserved line for this project and should not conflict with other community content. If when merging that 2da line needs to be moved only line number 46 in the script rh_giant_boulder_throw will need to be updated. The script will work without the the 2da file but here will be no giant or projectile animation.\n\nUpdate v1.2\n\nNew spell.2da with a reseved line\n\nUpdate v1.1\n\nUdates to SOZ and patch 1.23\nFixed problem with giant charging and attacking target after throwing only 1 boulder.\n\nIncludes a erf to make Evil Edison's Hill Giants throw boulders so you no longer need to use really big half-orcs. Requires his HAK Link\n\nPlease use this, merge it with your stuff, change it or whatever.

So the spawnpoint must have the same coordinates and orientation than the parts 1 and 2 of the tower with drawbridge.\nI want to thank SunJammer who began to work on a script which will add certain number of very considerable features (I think).

This gave me the tools to do some easy rescue missions like renumbering some content that had previously been lost due to model number conflicts, plus the ability to provide one of my new characters, Tigre, with more appropriate clothing and skin. It mushroomed a bit to include things appropriate for the oft-spicy role playing on this adult server, like panties. These files are numbered to fit into Pravita Nova's haks without conflicts.\n\nContents of Eph's Extras\n------------------------\n\nVERSION 1 (2 September 2008):\n\n1. (Oops. Never mind about the hair models. No hair models are here any more.)\n\n2. Brightened version of chain shirt number 2 for women and men. The chain mail is a lot shinier and coloring works better. These appear in the toolset as Chain Shirt 32. Should work for all races and both sexes.\n\n3. Made a striped tail for Tigre: tail #15. I include a modified tailmodel.2da into the hak.\n4. Bare-legged barbarian hides with stripes on the skin for Tigre. Hide Armor 99.\n5. Nude skin for Tigre. NK 249 (This skin was improved in version 2: whiter belly, better striping.)\n\nThe following should work for humans, halflings, planetouched, and elves, female only.\n\nFrom Aleanne's leopard bikini, etc.\n6. NK 92 - topless panties, with a pair of garters\n7. NK 93 - topless panties, slightly more covereage\n8. NK 94 - bottomless bikini top to go with 93\n\nFrom Always Summer by Chimneyfish: \n\n9. Topless skirt. NK 105\n\n10. Some dummy male model files so that the female ones show up in the toolset with no need for the Sin Laboratory Plugin to view.\n\nVERSION 2 (24 September 2008) adds:\n\n11. Male and Female nude with tintable pubic hair (female untrimmed triangle) - NK 240\n12. Male nude with tintable pubic, abdominal, and chest hair, Female nude with trimmed-strip - NK 241\n\nThese are based on the Zylch/Necrolord nudes, so they don't have support for female gnomes and dwarfs.\n\n13. The Always-summer leather skirt and sash for females, except with the underlying bikini top removed so that there is a sort of sash look with one breast exposed. This is padded-113 for elf and human females. There is also a Tigre human female version under NK-113.\n14. The Always-Summer Neverwinter-Eye tunic with the eye erased or replaced with a Fleur-de-lis. The original Always Summer with Eye is cloth-114, No Eye is padded-114, and Eye replaced by a Fleur de Lis is leather-114. These all work for males and females, except female gnomes and dwarfs. There is also a Tigre version for human females: NK-114.\n\nVERSION 3 (10 November 2008) adds:\n\n15. A head for Tigre (#27, female human) (tinting tweaked in v.4)\n16. A shorter hide armor outfit for Tigre (hide 97, female humans and elves)\n\n17. Sorceress Robe (cloth 230, female elves, humans, tieflings, aasimar, gnomes, dwarves, and those girly-girl wizardly half-orcs!)(normal map was tweaked in v.4 for \"flat\" skin but \"shiny\" robe.)\n\n18. Bare feet with calf ornament to match female slave/ succubus tunic (boots cloth 93, female elves and humans)\n19. Slippers, fully tintable (boots cloth 78, male and female, all races except female gnomes and dwarves)\n\n20. 14 optional inventory icons (small tga files). To get these to work, you'll have to add their names to your nwn2_icons.2da file. I did not use them in the accompanying item blueprints, but they are fully implemented in Eph's \"Social Community Hak Suite\" also available at the Vault, including the modified nwn2_icons.2da file.\n\nVERSION 4 (4 December 2008) All for female elves and humans.\n\n21. Belt nk-94: Abbreviated front-only dangly-chain loin (goes well with nk-89,90,91)\n22. Body nk-88: Tintable body-paint (goes with gloves nk-88 and boots nk-88)\n23. Body nk-89: Chain thong, topless\n24. Body nk-90: Chain thong, bikini top\n25. Body nk-91: Chain thong, bikini top, luminous wolf-moon tattoo (by request)\n26. Body cloth-231: backless dress\n27. Body nk-04: Tintable lace dress (human only)\n28. Body nk-05: Dress with fishnet pattern\n29. Body nk-06: Fishnet\n30. Gloves nk-88: tintable naked hands\n31. Boots nk-88: tintable naked feet\n\nVERSION 5 (7 November 2009)\n\n32. Veil (based on ACME helmets - useable by all races, both sexes) Helm ACME-50\n33. Aldinach's Alabaster Mask (ditto) Helm ACME-51\n34. Standard Pravita Female Slave Tunic (double dragon graphic, elf/human fem) Body cloth-233\n35. Female bathrobe (Based on the new Jester models) Use Jester's petite set: in the Social Haks, that's Body nk-13, Gloves cloth-49, Boots cloth-49. Then the bathrobe is Belt cloth-30.\n36. Tigre bathing suit (elf/human fem) Body nk-111\n37. Tigre simple shift (elf/human fem) Body nk-112\n38. Hair 42 - re-tintmapped version of braided Hair #9 - all races, female\n39. Hair 41 - re-tintmapped long hair for Zira, human female only\n\nPlus, I corrected an oversight - Elf females can now use all of the Tigre body options (nk249, nk113)\n\nAlso, the \"ACME\" category requires an \"armorvisualdata.2da\" file, which I include.\n\nVERSION 6 (1 June 2010)\n\n40. Tigre dress 1 - body nk 115\n41. Tigre dress 2 - body nk 116\n42. Tigre catsuit - body nk 117\n43. Veil, like 32 above, but more opaque. Helm ACME 52\n44. Tiger Man nude base. Body nk 13 or nk 14. (Ask Jester why there are two, 'cause I don't know.)\n45. Tiger Man tail - tail number 16, plus modified Tailmodel.2da file. You will still need Jester's nudes for the feet and hands on the Tiger man nude.\n46. 30 paintings. These are (Amraphael-overriding) reskins from Amraphael's placeables, painting over 30/60 of them.

Override version: Uncompress the file and place the directory and all it's content into your \\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\override directory. \n\nHow to select the new Wall Textures: \nClick on a tile, and then open the properties window. Click on the WallTexture drop down box. Look for the textures named �EstateWallJ01 to EstateWallJ20\". (See the pictures for an example of where to select this). \n\nFOR BEST RESULTS MAKE SURE THE FIRST TINT COLOR IS WHITE. This will show the wall in it's original color. Then proceed to tint from there. \n\nTexturesTileWall.2da from the 1.13 version of NWN2. \n\nTexturesTileWall.2da ranges used: \n167 - 189\n\n*You CAN try to use these wall textures on other tile-sets, but they will most likely not look very good. \n\nQuestions, Bugs, Comments and Feedback greatly appreciated! \n\nSpecial Thanks: Everyone in #nwn2cr for their thoughts and suggestions and help!

Every single Classic, Generic and Gothic placeable is here! Save yourself TONS of time. I have used Nytir's naming convention based off his .PDF. I changed some names slightly purely for sorting purposes in the placeable list.\n\nWhy get this one, and not just use the one included with the hakpak? The .ERF that comes with the Hakpak has only a small portion of the placeables that come with the hak. Some Generic, some Gothic and none of the Classic placeables are included. This .ERF solves all of that.\n\nHow to use it? Get Nytir's BCK II hak from here on the vault. Once you've added the haks to your module, import this .ERF instead of the one included with BCK II. You're done. If you already have BCK II installed and already used the original .ERF, simply import this one and when it asks if you want to overwrite the blueprint, say yes. Overwriting the blueprint will update the changes so that the names of everything are standardized.\n\nThis .ERF does NOT work 100% if you have changed the entries in placeables.2da. You'll get the blueprints but the appearances may be affected, depending on the changes you made.\n\nThere will be another .ERF here soon for the awesome compilation known as Skullhak.

This project of mine will enable you to play as one of 84 new subraces from all corners of Toril! And as a special treat I've also included all dynamic character models of the Avlis2 Team. So make sure to stop by at their PW and forums and thank Buddha and Clamb/Divaren for making their hard work avaible to us! =]\n\nNow, since our beloved BouncyRock Entertainment worked hard to provide us with such high quality driders, I've included their models into my pack and made them playable!\n\nFurther more, it will let you choose from 45 new pantheon deities! Many of the new deity icons are made by kankosthegreat! And to those of you who frowned at the way Atari included the Doomguide of Kelemvor and the Stormlord of Talos PrCs - no reason to frown any longer! I've corrected their descriptions and requirements to be like in PnP. Druids/rangers can also as of yet no longer access Kelemvor as their deity, for he's not and will not be a deity of nature.\n\n\n=========================================================================\n\nKnown Issues:\n\nDoomguide Issue:\n - For now the new alignment restriction is not working since I can't figure out how to do it propperly.

For wings and tails showing on player characters one must first edit them with a editing tool (any 2da or tlk editor should do the trick).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to use this Override Hack:\n\n- Simply extract the 7-zip file archive and put the data into your User/My Documents/Neverwinter 2 folder.

We announced its existance in our first NwNPodcast interview but one thing or another has kept me from working on it, I was never happy about its looks until now. So here it is. Our Pockiet Ship Interiors set.\n\nThis set has tiles for three different deck sizes, use them for different levels of the same ship or for individual levels of different sized vessels. A small collection of placeables is included in the set.\n\nStairs are placeables in this set, there is a placeable stair for ascending and a placeable hatch for descending, you will have to script or otherwise setup your own transitions.\n\nDont forget the up/dn arrow when selecting tiles as some tiles have alternates.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The captains cabin metatile is designed to connect to the midships(upper deck) tiles only, you could connect it to the other tiles I suppose with creative use of placeables.\n2. Bow tiles will only align with the narrow end of Fore tiles\n3. Stern tiles align with the midships tiles or the wide end of the fore tiles only.\n\nContents:\nInstallation instructions: \n\nThe RAR files should contain the following files: \n\nrws_pocketships.hak: \n\nplace this file in your \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak\" folder \n\nrws_pocketships_2da.hak: \n\nplace this file in your \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak\" folder \n\nit contains all the 2da files used by the tileset \n\nTiles.2da: \n\nAn override of the OEI tiles.2da file.

It contains no encounters or transitions at all. I suggest you open it up in your toolset and take a look. Remember to place your loose 2da's in the override.\n\nNote to builders: \n\nThe 2da files listed separately above are required to be in your override directory if you plan to build with this tileset...it is not necessary to have them in your override to play any mod that uses this tileset provided the player has the 2 hak files located properly. The hak file is for play. \n\nNote that Placeables.2da is an exception, it is located in the hak file and can be read by the toolset. I do not recommend you place that 2da in your override while you are building. \n\nDont forget to associate the hak with any modules you may be building by: (excerpted from Heeds Article at Link ) \n\n\"Opening your mod in the toolset and go to View --> Module Properties.

It has not yet been tested on SOZ.\n\nThis override changes all quarterstaffs and magic staff weapons into the two bladed sword weapons from the original Neverwinter game. Models, Icons, Damage, Weapon type, and text have all been changed to turn all the staffs into two bladed swords. Any magical effects the staffs had originally remain. \n\n( Please note this will REPLACE all the staff weapons. If you like your staffs don�t use this ! ) \n\nHere�s a quick list of what the Override changes:\n\nModels of all staffs have been replaced. ( Thx MWMDragon )\nNew replacement weapon icons.\nDamage stats of the two bladed swords are set to match those of the Halberd.\nWeapon type set to double-sided (so you should get an offhand attack).\nText in game has been replaced, both in game and feat descriptions.\nExotic weapon feat needed to use these weapons ( This was done as a balance for the extra damage these weapons do )\nWeapon sounds set to metallic.\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\nUnzip into the ( ****\\Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override ) folder. Just like any other override.\n\nCopy the ( dialog.TLk ) file into the ( ****\\Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2 ) folder\n\nNote if you are using any other Hak�s / overrides that edit the TLk file it may conflict with this mod.\n\nThat�s all there is to it.\n\nNotes :\n\nFinally just to let everyone know I am not a programmer or anything like that.

A practitioner of vile and forbidden arts, the dread necromancer roots about in graveyards, searching out moldering components for her obscene spells. She calls upon restless, tormented spirits of the dead, seeking their arcane secrets. She might be a consummate villain, or perhaps a tortured hero whose obsession with death leads her along questionable moral paths.\n\nClass Features:\n\n- Hit Die: d6\n\n- Base Attack Bonus: Low.\n\n- High Saves: Will.\n\n- Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and martial weapons.\n\n- Armor Proficiencies: Light armor. A dread necromancer can use any of her spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A dread necromancer wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure.\n\n- Skill Points: 2 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level.\n\n- Class Skills: Bluff, Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Weapon, Hide, Intimidate, Lore and Spellcraft.\n\n- Spells: A dread necromancer casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the dread necromancer�s spell list. Like a sorcerer, she can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. When a dread necromancer gains access to a new level of spells, she automatically knows all the spells for that level given on the dread necromancer�s spell list.\n\n- Charnel Touch: Negative energy flows through a dread necromancer�s body, concentrating in her hands. At will she can make a melee touch attack against a living foe that deals 1d8 points of damage, +1 per four class levels. This touch heals undead creatures, restoring 1 hit point per touch, +1 per four class levels.\n\n- Rebuke Undead: A dread necromancer can rebuke or command undead creatures by channeling negative energy through her body.\n\n- Lich Body: Starting at 2nd level, a dread necromancer begins her journey into undeath. The first symptom is her body�s increased resilience to physical harm. She gains DR 2/ bludgeoning and magic. As the dread necromancer increases in level, this DR increases in effectiveness, to DR 4 at 7th level, DR 6 at 11th level, and DR 8 at 15th level.\n\n- Negative Energy Burst: Beginning at 3rd level, a dread necromancer gains the ability to emit a burst of negative energy from her body, harming living creatures within 5 feet of her. This burst deals 1d4 points of damage per class level. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + Cha modifi er) reduces damage by half. Undead creatures within this burst are healed the same amount of hit points as the damage she deals to living creatures. A dread necromancer can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, and one additional time per day for every five levels she attains beyond 3rd (2/day at 8th level, 3/day at 13th level, and 4/day at 18th level).\n\n- Mental Bastion: Starting at 4th level, a dread necromancer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist mind-affecting effects, poison, or disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 14th level.\n\n- Fear Aura: At 5th level, a dread necromancer can create an aura of fear that affects all enemies within 20' at will. Foes must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier) or become shaken.\n\n- Scabrous Touch: Starting at 6th level a dread necromancer can use her charnel touch to inflict disease on a creature she touches.\n\n- Summon Familiar: At 7th level a dread necromancer can obtain a familiar. (A new Imp familiar has been added to the familiar list)\n\n- Undead Mastery: All undead creatures created by a dread necromancer who has reached 8th level or higher gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and 2 additional hit points per Hit Die.\nIn addition, when a dread necromancer uses a spell to create undead, she can control 4 + her Charisma bonus HD worth of undead creatures per class level (rather than the 4 HD per level normally granted).\n\n- Negative Energy Resistance: Beginning at 9th level, a dread necromancer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist negative energy effects, including energy drain, some ability drain, and inflict spells.\n\n- Fortification: At 10th level, a dread necromancer becomes immune to sneak attacks. At 17th level she also becomes immune to critical hits.\n\n- Enervating Touch: When a dread necromancer reaches 12th level, she gains the ability to bestow negative levels when she uses her charnel touch attack.\n\n- Craft Wondrous Item: At 19th level, the dread necromancer gains Craft Wondrous Item as a bonus feat.\n\n- Undead Transformation: When a dread necromancer attains 20th level, she undergoes a hideous transformation and becomes practically undead herself. She gains most of the abilities and advantages a lich would have.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Spells\n\n- Summon Undead I-V: These spells function like summon creature, except that you summon undead creatures.\n\n- Chill Touch (Level 1): A touch from your hand disrupts the life force of living creatures.\n\n- Bestow Wounds (Level 1): You can transfer your wounds to others by touch.\n\n- Ghoul Gauntlet (Level 6): Your touch gradually transforms a living victim into a ravening, flesh-eating ghoul.\n\n- Vile Death (Level 7): The target undead creature permanently gains damage resistance to fire and cold, damage reduction, spell Resistance and smite good as a bonus feat.\n\n- Heat Drain (Level 8): You drain the heat from all living creatures within the affected area except you. This influx of warmth heals and empowers you.\n\n- Plague of Undead (Level 9): Plague of undead creates 2 skeleton archers and 2 zombie guardians with maximum hit points for their Hit Dice. The undead remain animated until destroyed.\n\n- Dread Necromancers gain special versions of the animate dead, create undead and create greater undead spells which last permanently and scale with character level.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRequirements\n\n- Neverwinter Nights 2 with the Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir Expansions as well as the latest patch (1.21).\n\nInstallation\n\nThis is an override version only. To install this class you need to put the \"dread necromancer\" folder inside the archive into your override folder that is located in your \"My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\" folder and the Dialog.tlk file directly into your \"My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\" folder.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThis mod is incompatible with any mod that changes the same 2da files or the dialog.tlk file.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKnown Issues\n\nIt is very improtant that you always use \"Recommended\" whenever you get a choice of spells for this class. Don't worry, you will get all the spells you are supposed to get. You will break your character if you chose any of the other spells!\nThis is due to the way spellbooks and new casting classes are handled by the game.\n\nIf you travel on the SoZ overland map you may lose the buffs from undead mastery and vile death.\n\nSometimes in the OC and possibly in other campaigns, all spells, summons and companions are removed from the player. In those cases you also lose all your summoned undead servants.\n\nUndead Transformation does not make you really undead, so healing spells still heal you and harm spells still harm you and you can't be turned.\n\nWith many undead servants you may experience a slow down.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou may use all contents of this mod in any way you want.","Rating":9.36,"Votes":11,"Awards":[]},"413":{"Name":"Spellcasting Framework 2.0","Author":"ladydesire/jallaix","Submitted":20090203,"Updated":20090302,"Category":"Code Modifications","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This is my update of jallaix's Spellcasting Framework for NWN2 with the Storm of Zehir Expansion.

Unfortunately, real life gets in the way too much and i am lacking the motivation to continue with this. Therefore if anyone would like to take my work and update it, please feel free.\n\nLoki's Class Pack Readme.\n\nWorking Title: Saints and Sinners\n\nVersion: 0.3\n\nRequirements: Storm of Zehir (unpatched - v1.22). Clean override (unless you know what you are doing). Do not install on any other version unless you really know what you are doing. Things are likely to break.\n\nSTATUS: Not BETA anymore! I'm sure there are still some small issues but unless i have done something stupid then this should work quite well now.\n\n\nWhat this pack Contains:\nLoki's Alternate Paladins\n\nWhat this pack also contains:\nKaedrin's Class Pack v 1.36\nDraco Rayne's Warlock Buddy\nLoki's Panther Familiar and Panther Companion upgrade.\n\nCredit for additional mods goes to the respective authors. If any author objects to their work being contained in my pack please inform me (via the vault or via the official forums (Loki_999 on both)) and i will remove the offending content forthwith.\n\nSome items removed from previous version (eg: TonyK AI), partially to reduce size of the pack and partially to give people more choice as to what to install themselves. The pack remains compatible with Tonyk's AI but as usual, if you are going to add other stuff then you should know what you are doing.\n\nInstallation:\nUnzip (using 7-zip) to your My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2 folder. The dialog.tlk should go directly into this folder with everything else going into the Override folder. To enable the Warlock Buddy go to your game installation directory (Not the My Documents one. You want where the game is actually installed.). Go into the UI\\default directory and edit the ingamegui.ini (as well as ingameguix1.ini and ingameguix2.ini). In the section below [MandatoryGUI] but before the following section, insert the following on a new line: SCREEN_WARLOCK=warlock.xml\nThis will enable the use of the Warlock Buddy. For further information do a search for it on the vault.\n\nWhat this pack contains:\n3 Alternate Paladins from Unearthed Arcana, the Paladin of Freedom (CG), Tyranny (LE), and Slaughter (CE). Please note, due to engine limitations and hardcoded stuff these are not exact replicas of the standard (or true) Paladin. All Paladins, including the original can now summon a mount (non-rideable) that increases in strength as the Paladin increases in levels. They get the mount at Level 5.\n\nWhat is different?:\n1) No Smite evil. In theory a workaround is possible to produce something similar, but i am so far not happy with what i can produce. Therefore, for the moment, to compensate for the lack of Smite Evil/Good the Paladins gain bonus feats at levels 1, 11, and 21.\n2) Auras. All Paladins get the aura of Courage instead of the auras specific to their type. Possible to change but not a burning issue.\n3) Spellbooks. Apparently Kaedrin is looking at a way of creating a type of custom spellbook by doing something fancy with the UI. Until this is made public the Paladins get a limited list of spells from the standard spell lists (with some tweaks) and they are slightly different between the paladin types. The spells are done the same way Kaedrin did his Blackguard and Asassin spellbooks. Basically you get feats and from these feats you can choose to cast from a spell list of 5 spells per spell level meaning with level 4 spells you have a total of 20 spells to choose from. I deviated from the official sources here to grant earlier spellcasting to compensate for the lack of choice. Level 1 spells are granted at level 1 and you gain a new usage every 5 levels up to a max of 5 at level 21. Level 2 spells start at character level 6 and follow the same progression. Level 3 at 11 and level 4 at 16. You can only cast a maximum of 4 level 3 spells and 3 level 4 spells.\n4) No metamagic. For the moment these are removed and the feats cannot be taken on Paladin levels. Same goes for the spell focus feats. I may change this later. You may consider the alternate paladins to be more martial than the original paladin.\n\nKnown 'bugs':\nVery Low: Icons. Some icons are not correct for some spells, although more because they need new ones creating.\nCure Wounds spells: Cannot target enemies, for harming undead. This is a known problem and a hardcoded issue. Can't do anything about it directly apart from use Obsidian's versions of the spells. Will consider this.\n\nOther:\nPlease dont ask to make the horses rideable. It is well out of my ability and too much work for even those with the skill to consider (probably).\n\nHelp:\nOne thing i am not happy with is the new icons i made for the paladin mounts and master spell feats. If anyone has any skill with creating icons then would be happy to recieve your input and give credit.\n\nFuture:\nThe working title is called Saints and Sinners because i believe that the pack should have a focus and direction. Therefore the focus is going to be on classes that are either saints or sinners. \n\nI am trying to avoid duplicating classes that others have already done or are planning to do. Therefore I am pretty much sold on the idea of creating some PrCs from the Book of Erotic Fantasy so will be working towards this for my next release.\n\nOther ideas and suggestions from people will be considered, although please keep in mind that i am a relative beginner at this and even the masters of NWN2 modding such as Kaedrin, TonyK, REERON, player1, and others, dedicate an enormous amount of time to their relative projects and what may seem like a simple request can turn into months of work.\n\nFinal:\nIf you download this pack and try it out, please comment on what you like and dont like, and let me know any bugs you find or suspect.\n\nCheers.\n","Rating":9.17,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"422":{"Name":"Loki's Panther Familiar","Author":"Loki_999","Submitted":20090318,"Updated":20090319,"Category":"Creatures","Patch":"1.21","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"A quick hack to make the Panther animal companion also usable as a familiar.\n\nAlso the panther has been beefed up to give it sneak attack like in NWN1.\n\nThis should only conflict with anything that also alters hen_familiar.2da or hen_companion.2da\n\nUnzip it to your override folder.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"423":{"Name":"Exotic Dream Placeables 1.1","Author":"dreatern","Submitted":20090323,"Updated":20110725,"Category":"Placeables","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"----Hak Pack Contents----\n\n-Board Quest \n-Bag Rope \n-Glow Flower (exotic plant) \n-Flower Glow ROOTS (exotic plant) \n-Nephi Pitcher Plant (exotic plant)\n\n----Added with 1.1-----\n-Tree Hive HONEY\n-Tree Hive STONE\n-HoneyFall\n-Tree Trunk With Hole\n\n!!ALL FULL TINTABLE!!\n\nYou must edit the 2DA to work with other haks (if you are using different haks)\n\nHAK and ERF(blueprints) within .rar file\n\nYou can watch this video to see the placeables in-game here and have an idea of how to use the HoneyFall with the Tree Hive YOUTUBE VIDEO ->Link\n\n-----INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS\n\n[!!!!Put the file exoticdream.hak inside the Hak folder first!!!!]\n\n1-Install exoticdream.hak on module properties \n\n2-Import the exoticdream.erf (File>Import) [Easy way to find all placeables]\n\n3- You can find all things inside the Placeable Group > Category \"Exotic_Dream\"\n\n!!!----TIPS---!!!\n\nTIP 1: You can use the special effect fx_bug_swarm to put some bees aroud the Tree Hive\n\nTIP 2: The HoneyFall animation can be easily configured. select the HoneyFall, go to the placeable properties and\nchange the \"V\" \"UV Scroll\" value.

So, I tried to solve that here.\n\nPlease note that this hak has a custom placeables.2da and doortypes.2da. I took no time to make sure that they will be compatible with other custom content, the lines were added right after the official ones from SoZ.

And while this was originally released as a HAK file, I've deleted that in favor of Override style files. This makes it more available to either just have in your Override, or drop into your module folder, campaign folder or import to your own hak.\n\nAlso added a Master 2DA which is culmulative and has all the different texture packs combined in a single 2DA for placeables and doortypes. This is for ease of updating. If you plan on using multiple packs, use these 2DA files.

After adding, you can Import the contents of the Blueprints folders from inside the toolset, these are .ERFs.\n\nIf you are using more than one pack, use the Master 2DA file instead of the one supplied in the individual packs. This file will be updated as new packs are added.\n\n=======================================\n\nCredits:\n\n- Models and textures are from those that come with the game, though I did edit the cave door's texture to give the black area (it's actually floor textures).\n\n- Created using MDB Cloner by RunnerDuck\n\n=======================================\n\nPermissions:\n\nUse as you see fit but please give credit.

Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n-Please report any bugs or other oddities so we can address them quickly.\n\n---------------------\nUSAGE NOTES AND LIMITATIONS\n\n-Packhorse will flee all enemies and combat when not controlled and not in puppet mode (see below). It can however attack when directly controlled by a player. But it is not a very efficient fighter.\n-Packhorse will be taken out of puppet mode automatically (if puppet mode is set) so that it will continue to flee combat as a packhorse should. It will be reset to puppet mode at the end of combat.\n-When transferring entire inventories it may happen sometimes that some or all items �vanish�. Items still exist and will usually reappear if one or two other transfers are performed or if the inventory is manually or automatically rearranged.\n-Similarly, it has happened that the horse will keep a \"ghost\" copy of its inventory after a transfer. These item \"copies\" are not useable however, and will disappear from the horse inventory after another transfer is performed.\n-Packhorse is set to follow the party leader at distance \"far\" by default. However, this setting sometimes changes to \"near\" on its own. Desired follow distance can be reset in the horse�s behavior tab.\n-In order to allow the horse to carry heavy loads, its strength was set to 23, which is higher than official stats. Its creature weapon however has a penalty which offsets the strength bonus.\n-If your packhorse brings you to the mod's companion limit (as in SoZ), you will have to talk to it and \"hobble\" it (this will take it out of the party) before you can ask another potential companion to join you. Once you;ve done that, you can talk to the horse again to have it rejoin you.\n-Packhorse is not rideable! ;)\n\n---------------------\nCREDITS\n\nGaming Parents Studios\nOriginal idea and beta testing: Sirchet\nPackhorse's load : Daronas (rope, crate, keg, and bedroll modeled and textured by Obsidian)\nBlueprints, dialogues and scripts: E.C.Patterson","Rating":9.82,"Votes":18,"Awards":[]},"436":{"Name":"RWS_Standard_Interiors","Author":"RWS","Submitted":20090510,"Updated":20091115,"Category":"Tilesets","Forum Thread":"Link","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Welcome to RWS Interior Ceilings\nby Robinson Workshop\n\nRWS Interior Ceilings is a replacement of the original Standard Interior tileset tiles, with a few extra tiles added in.

I also discovered sleeves were easier than I thought. Finally I spend more than the usual 15 seconds on clothes textures and put together a couple of sets of underwear (fully tintable). This will hopefully satisfy the PW people :-) \n\nThe catsuit was easy, but I'm not sure how useful/sensible it is. It's a lot of polys to achieve something that could be mostly done with a proper base texture. Anyway, I've included it, but use with care. \n\nOnly three sets of UVS - one for the long robe, one for the short and one for all the bodies (and catsuit). I've only included .mdbs of the underwear for the bodies with feet and hands - I'm sure you can manage to sort it out if you want to use the outfits with boots.\n\nAny future retexturing I do I'll probably use these meshes - I think they're the best yet.\n\nJust need to get the male base neck sorted out and then I'm done with this!\n\n***********************\n\nOK - done the male bases. Same deal as before - P_HHM_NK_Body02 has hands and feet but may clash with boots and gloves. P_HHM_NK_Body03 has no hands or feet. Came together OK in the end.\n\n*************\n\nAll the dresses are done now - phew.. going to be week or two to get the male base done unless a cunning idea I've had works.\n\nLet me know any problems and I'll do my best to fix them.\n\n****Long Dress 1 done****\nWell that was a nightmare - there is very bad mesh stretch when running on the front and back of the dress - confined to the centre panels. This seems to be unavoidable - all the original dresses suffer from it as well. I strongly advise leaving a slit in the dress if you want it to be used by a player (who will be running everywhere)\n\nI may revisit the weighting a bit in the future, but it's not going to get much better. If somebody else wants to try feel free!\n\n***Now with smaller breasts!*** (By request)\nAdded:\nNK_Body04 (with hands and feet)\nNK_Body05 (without)\n\nYes - its the long awaited (well by me anyway) JNNWC!\n\nArdells work on the Blender scripts reignited my interested in doing something for NWN2 - so I figured I revisit my first project - chainmail bikinis (hey, a guy's got to have an obsession...) I soon found Zylch's nude a bit restrictive and so did my own. It's got a few more polys than the original, but I think it looks better for it. Look at the hands and feet - no seams! (Only possible thanks to Ardell)\n\nOnce I'd done that I had to make a dress to go in the belt slot so you reskinners can have some fun. \n\nThe main change to the nude is that I've redone the UV map so there's more texture space (and more polys means a better profile too). This may lead to seam problems for some people but solutions to this do exist - drop me a line if you're have problems retexturing it. Likewise making the dress a second object means it's got a much better texture space too - much more scope to do your own hemlines.\n\nThe seamless hands and feet are done by modelling hands feet on the main body but then having invisible boots and gloves. This causes problems if you do put gloves and boots on the mesh - so use NK3 if you're planning to this - it has no hands and feet. \n\nI've done the elven one too - just a quick rename. It uses the same textures as the human one.\n\nI have no plans to do dwarves and half-orcs yet - if enough people want them I suppose I could. \n\nInterestingly once I'd got the nude done and the texture baking sorted out I was able to do the bikini in about 2 hours flat - so I may produce a few more varients. The dress texture took all of 5 minutes, but you can probably see that from looking at it!\n\nPrograms used:\nDaz 3d for the high poly model\nBlender\nGimp\n\nHave fun!\n\nJester","Rating":9.76,"Votes":25,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"439":{"Name":"Good Looking Cloaks","Author":"Zydu","Submitted":20090528,"Updated":20090704,"Category":"Other","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Thease are some simple reskined cloaks.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nChangelog\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n1.2\n-new cloaks added\n1.1\n-now cloaks work with other races.","Rating":9.75,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"440":{"Name":"P&P Style Palemaster Bone Armor","Author":"Jake Zahn","Submitted":20090606,"Updated":20090622,"Category":"Prestige Classes","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This Mod simply replaces the Palemaster's Bone Skin feat with a Craft Bonemail feat which you gain at level 4.\n\nCrafting System Version: Place a Hide, Studded Leather, Leather, or Breastplate, Light Shield, or Tower Shield Mold in a Magician's Workbench.

In game, he will still use the original spellbook, and cast spells normally.\nThere's still a bug which I was not able to track down, that causes the GUI to not display some spells in the spell selection screen (and in particular, the 2nd level Darkness spell - now that happens ALWAYS on my box). If that happens, simply changing the displayed spell level (or adding and removing a spell from the learned spells list), and then going back, fixes the problem (the spells are then correctly displayed). Still, it's annoying. Currently I don't know why this happens: if someone finds out, I'd be glad to hear about it.\nAssassin and blackguard spells do count as PrCs requisites, however, since the two classes are capped at level 10, keep in mind that the caster level will cap at level 10 too. That means that an assassin 10/eldritch knight 10 still casts as an assassin 10.\nI was forced to give the blackguard spontaneous casting to be able to build the spell list in the correct way. The blackguard still learns all the spells that are available to the class though.\nI removed the assassin and blackguard old 1x day \"spells\".\nExtra spell slots feats and practiced spell caster feats seem to work correctly, please report any bugs you find.\nTo speed up the GUI process from slow to acceptable I had to make some changes to the spell level of many powers such as barbarian rage: I usually gave them no spell level. If you find out bugs with this solution, point them out.\nLastly, the code depends on the language of your NWN2 installation. I can't do anything about it, it's just how it works at the engine level. This means that, while things are completely ok for singleplayer, in multiplayer you may end up getting weird or no filters on the spell list of these two classes if the assassin/blackguard player owns a NWN2 version of a different language than the server language. This is because the game, at the GUI level, recognizes the spells by their TLK names.\nI provided a hak and an override version: however, the hak version still has an override folder, cause it seems the game does not read packages from haks. If you don't really care about the \"Recommended\" button doing nothing, you can drop it.\nBoth archives include a very very simple test module.\n\nUPDATE (08/01/09): added the scripts (both source and compiled) to the hak and override folder - no need to grab them from the module any longer.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"448":{"Name":"skydomes by Hoegbo","Author":"Hoegbo","Submitted":20090730,"Updated":20090731,"Category":"Armor","Description":"these are some of the skydomes used in my exterior areas in my upcomming module The Demons Melody. the images are not of my own but the author M@dcow alows use as long as they are not used comercially.\nhere is M@dcow found on the web\n(http://blenderartists.org/forum/member.php?u=294)\n(http://www.newcgcreations.com/)\n\n\n\nInstallation : \n\ncopy the hak to\n\nDocuments\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak\n\nadd the hak to the module and save. easy as pie.\nopen the area properties and under the\nappearance -> Area properties ->Day /night cycle select the appropriate apropriate cycle (monrise ,daytime ,default) you wnat the skydome to appear. then then head to the skydome part under the selected cycle and write fx_skydome_tdmX where X is the numer 1 to 11 which is the number of the skybox.\nsave the module and reload. voila a new sky is there for your viewing pleasure.\n\nsome skyboxes like the\n fx_skydome_tdm4\nfx_skydome_tdm11\n\nis best restricted to a 300 degree angle instead of a full 360 \nthere are 2 suns there and I hid one of them behind some terain to get the effect I wanted.\nhowever I decided to include them regardless.\n","Rating":9.83,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"449":{"Name":"Placeables with walkmeshes addition","Author":"Argyl","Submitted":20090802,"Updated":20090802,"Category":"Placeables","Patch":"1.22","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"In this submission, I present a pack of 3 models in which I've added walkmeshes.\nI've seen the demand of Wyvern76 on the RWS forums and I think that numerous are those who wish to use stairs and platforms of these models.\n\n=> Rural burned watchtower : walkmesh addition.\n\n\n=> Rural watchtower : walkmesh addition and minor changes done to the model.\n\n\n=> Windmill : walkmesh addition with the following changes :\n\n=====> Stairs moving\n\n=====> Floor part deletion\n\n=====> Addition of hook points for doors (I suggest to use the {Rural House Door})\n\n\nAs this content overrides the official's one, it will work with all patchs.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n\nDans cette soumission, je vous présente un pack de 3 modèles auxquels j'ai ajouté des walkmeshes.\nJ'ai vu la demande de Wyvern76 sur les forums de RWS et je pense que nombreux sont ceux qui souhaitent utiliser les escaliers et les plateformes de ces modèles.\n\n=> La tour de guet rurale brûlée : addition du walkmesh.\n\n\n=> La tour de guet rurale : addition du walkmesh et quelques changements mineurs au niveau du modèle.\n\n\n=> Le moulin à vent : addition du walkmesh et les changements suivants\n\n=====> déplacement de l'escalier,\n\n=====> Suppression d'un partie du plancher,\n\n=====> Addition de hook points pour les portes (Je suggère d'utiliser les {Rural House Door})\n\nComme ces modèles overrident les modèles officiels, ce contenu est compatible avec toute version de patchs.","Rating":9.46,"Votes":9,"Awards":[]},"450":{"Name":"Amraphael's Placeables Pack #1","Author":"Amraphael","Submitted":20090811,"Updated":20090814,"Category":"Placeables","Patch":"1.21","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"This is 110 of the custom placeables from my NWN2 module, ZORK - Rediscovering the Great Underground Empire made available for all builders to enjoy. \n\nNote that I'm _NOT_ a 3D artist, this is what I needed for my module so I did what I could in my own amateurish way.

Which is to say it was inspired by Pocket Citadel, shares its look and feel to a certain degree, but it is actually a new set. Some geometry carries over but for the most part it is all new. New textures, new geometry and new tiles. Grand Citadel is not designed to work with Pocket Citadel and it does not replace the Pocket Citadel in the toolset.\n\nSo whats the same?\n\nThis set is built around the same column geometry that Pocket Citadel, this geometry was inspired by the untextured sketchup model of Colonel Mcoy - See his google warehouse entry below \n\nLink\n\nGrand Citadel remains a split level tileset with upper and lower floor levels. Thus the same issues regarding doors holds. Because of this split level design, almost all the doors in this set are transition doors, i.e. doors that the player will transition to another area through, and not simple passage doors. However unlike Pocket Citadel, the lower level doors located against an outer wall are passage doors. Also there is a stairwal with a midlevel landing, that door too is a passage door. I have provided a mid level room to match it.\n\nThe spiral stairs from Pocket Citadel remain as well. Please note the walkmesh only goes so far up the spiral, it will be required that the builder place a transition somewhere alonlg the walkable portion of the spiral for it to connect with anything.\n\nSo Whats new?\n\nA good deal more flexibility, Pocket Citadel contained about 34 tiles, Grand Citadel more than doubles that count to about 80, Grand Citadel also comes with a number of placeable models such as walls and wall fragments to help build the set, more about that later and a metatile or two.\n\nGrand Citadel has much different geometry apart from those parts that carry over and I've found that some of the walls, specifically the the lower battered walls (angled) can leave gaps when they abut to vertical walls. This can be avoided by the builder, there are ample tiles to permit it, but for ultimate flexibility I also have created a number of wall parts that match the texture of the set than can be used to fill such gaps.\n\nSconces and Chandeliers are also available as placeables.\n\ntips:\n\n1.The big entry tile uses a double door, since there is no real standard double door size in the game I had to pick one that fits the opening. The door is question can be found under the doors section 03-WALLS,MISC I'm sorry thats the only door thats gonna fit the opening.\n\n2. there is a stair with a mid landing - this stair also has a doorway and I added a single room that will meet with this doorway - this room is not at the upper or lower floor elevation but is rather at a mid landing between them. This one room tile is the only tile that will mate with this door.\n\n\n\nContents: \n\nThe RAR files should contain the following files: \n\nrws_Grand_Citadel.hak: \n\nplace this file in your \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak\" folder it contains all the textures and models required for the set.\n\nrws_Grand_Citadel_2da.hak: \n\nplace this file in your \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak\" folder it contains all the 2da files used by the tileset \n\nTiles.2da: \n\nAn override of the OEI tiles.2da file.

This is my translation of the Tome of Battle: The Book of the Nine Swords into Neverwinter Nights 2.\n\nThis class pack introduces the core Martial Adept classes, the Crusader, Swordsage and Warblade, along with the 208 maneuvers and stances of the Nine Disciplines that comprise the Sublime Way. Also included are 24 new feats, which allow any class to dabble in martial adept abilities.\n\nMy special thanks go out to my family and friends who've had to put up with me going on about \"Iron Heart Surge\" this, or \"Ruby Nightmare Blade\" that. Your love and patience is really what kept me at this.\n\nInstallation:\n\n1.Unzip the Tome of Battle folder into your override folder. You can find this inside MyDocuments\\Neverwinter Nights 2. Currently, this class pack will conflict with others (hopefully not for too much longer) so be advised that using the Tome of Battle with other class packs could cause issues.\n2.Unzip dialog.tlk and place it in My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2. This doesn�t go into override or any of the other folders. All you need to do is place it inside the Neverwinter Nights 2 folder in MyDocuments.\n\nVersion 1.142\n\n-Improvements to scaling of most range checks.\n-Corrected a bad 2da entry with the compatibility files for Kaedrin�s PrC pack which caused important background information not to function.\n\nVersion 1.141\n\n-Bug fix to Wolverine Stance to prevent shields and other non-weapons in the offhand slot from adding to the regeneration bonus.\n-Fixed Death Mark so that range and DC values are calculated correctly.\n-Corrected an issue with Shadow Blade that caused its bonus to sometimes be omitted when the player had a piercing weapon equipped.\n-Implemented a series of checks to ensure that the Tome of Battle and maneuver objects are flagged as cursed, since without this flag all kind of bugs can crop up.\n\nVersion 1.14\n\n-The Swordsage�s AC bonus is now applied as a permanent effect which is only updated when a condition that influences this bonus changes. This should eliminate the infamous repeating �You have a bonus that does not stack� message.\n- Warblade maneuver recovery has been adjusted so that maneuvers are recovered at the end of the swift action�s round rather than at the beginning.\n- Overhaul of the leveling and feat retraining systems. The new systems should be much less prone to errors.\n-Maneuvers.2da has been expanded to allow customization of the current maneuvers and to allow anyone to add entirely new maneuvers (because we all love custom content). See maneuvers.txt in the 2da file for information.\n-To showcase the new ability to add maneuvers, I added a new first level White Raven Boost called Encouragement.\n- Overhaul of the 2da indexing system. The new system has been designed for efficiency and to allow Persistent World scripters to hook their own lookup systems directly into the Tome of Battle (check the library file, bot9s_inc_2da for this).\n-Small bugfix for White Raven Tactics, Fan the Flames, and Distracting Ember. The range detection check was too short because it did not take into account the target�s size.\n-The first time the player levels their maneuvers a starting weapon is also created.\n-Fixed an issue that was causing the Swordsage�s 12th level Insightful Strike to be ignored.\n-Initiating more than one strike from outside of melee range will no longer enqueue many separate move actions. Each strike that was called from out of range will enqueue properly, once the player is within range of their target.\n-Corrected a few bad tags for the Tome of Battle object that were missed in 1.13. \n\nVersion 1.13\n\n- Implemented safeguards against the loss of 2da and tlk data.\n- Removed the BAB requirement on Stone Power. How it got there in the first place, I�ll never know�\n- Adjusted the Swordsage�s AC bonus so that it will not be applied to the player while they are already under a shield AC bonus effect (such as Mage Armor).\n- Optimized how the Tome of Battle object is identified in NWScript.\n- Several small code optimizations throughout. Nothing that should be noticeable, but it should make things run a little more smoothly.\n- Took another shot at maneuvers hanging on larger creatures. It should (cross your fingers) be fixed now.\n- Added a check on an opponent�s health that prevents a maneuver from expending if the opponent is already at less than one hit point.\n\nVersion 1.12\n\n- The Tome of Battle is now compatible with Mysteries of Westgate.\n- Fixed an issue which caused a maneuver to be unable to be used if the player interrupted it while moving. In relation to this bug (to be on the safe side) I�ve made it so that clicking on the swift action box will clear out the action queue and how maneuvers are recorded on it. It functions like a panic button.\n- Expanded the dialog.tlk and cleaned up a few typos.\n- Resolved the issue that would freeze the maneuver selection screen. My special thanks to BrainMeyer for pointing out the cause of this bug.\n- Greatly improved how feats with recursive loops are handled. This was to prevent an issue where module transition would shut down the loops and prevent them from running again.\n- Added a new icon to the Maneuvers Known menu. When pressed, it opens a menu where the player can preview all maneuver and stance descriptions by level and discipline.\n\nVersion 1.11\n\n- Files for compatibility with Kaedrin�s PrC Pack 1.40 are now available.\n- Fixed an issue with Aura of Perfect Order which caused will saves to be calculated incorrectly.\n- Crusaders now have access to tower shields automatically, as per the class description. Oops...\n- Battle Skill has been adjusted. The penalties to an opponent's knockdown and disarm attempts have been removed. Instead the Warblade gains immunity to knockdown starting in the first round of combat for a duration in rounds equal to his intelligence modifier (if any).\n\nVersion 1.102\n\n- Corrected an issue where the movement part of a maneuver�s execution would hang a strike with larger creatures.\n\nVersion 1.101\n-Hotfix to correct an issue where Storm of Zehir�s OnAquire script destroys all of a companion�s maneuver items.\n\nVersion 1.1\n\n- Warblade maneuver progression has been corrected.\n- Burning Brand and Dancing Blade Form have both been rescripted to prevent a rare bug from occurring. Item swapping has been removed from both scripts and overall their functionality is much smoother than the previous versions.\n- The base items for the Tome of Battle and the maneuvers have been altered to correct compatibility issues for players without Mask of the Betrayer or Storm of Zehir.\n- Multiple issues preventing companions from using maneuvers have been resolved. \n- The Maneuvers Known screen will no longer automatically open on the player�s Stance listing. This is due to an overall improvement in how xml data is now handled.\n- Switched from the system of linked effects to one of totaled structs, which are then used to calculate damage in a single linked effect with each damage type. While it won't entirely eliminate the issue of Damage Reduction being applied to each source of damage, it does eliminate a large amount of damage lost that was reduced. \n\nVersion 1.01\n\n- Swordsages now correctly have medium BAB progression.\n- Crusader alignment restriction has been corrected and the descriptive text made a little clearer regarding alignment.\n- The combat override state now correctly includes routing for Circle Kick and Flurry of Blows.","Rating":9.97,"Votes":46,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"472":{"Name":"Cyphre's Companions Pack (CCP) v0.75.2 Beta","Author":"Cyphre","Submitted":20091106,"Updated":20121215,"Category":"Creatures","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"*** NEW UPDATE (with support for Kaedrin's PrC Pack v1.42.1 and my own PrC Pack v0.75) - AVAILABLE NOW!!! ***\n\nVersion 0.75.2 Beta (2012.11.19) / Page Update: (2012.12.15)\n\nDo you like animals & mythical/fantasy creatures? \n\nI do.. and it's one of the reasons, why I also prefer to play characters, that have a creature companion. \nSadly, the standard creature companions in NWN2 are far from being satisfactory/close to PnP and even still contain bugs, too. \n\nWith Kaedrin's PrC Pack, things got a lot better (especially due to new feats & spells, that support creature companions), \nbut (most of) the companions themselves were still not powerful enough to make a character/build focused on companions \n(such as the Beastmaster of Kuldahar) a viable option and originally there were not that many creatures available to choose from, too. \n\nThere already are some other mods, that add/change animal/creature companions, but most of them are out of date, \noffer just a few creatures and/or don't work with Kaedrin's PrC Pack. \nSo here's my personal vision of how creature companions should be in NWN2..\n\n[Q]\nWhat's CCP (Cyphre's Companions Pack)?\n\n[A]\nCCP is a modification for Neverwinter Nights 2, that tries to accomplish the following goals:\n\n+(1)Adding new Creature Companions\n+(2)Enhancing already existing Animal Companions\n+(3)To introduce/add an aging/growing system for Creature Companions.\n+(4)Enhancing/adding some new textures/effects such as glowing eyes.\n+(5)Offering stuff/resources, that also could be useful for module/pw creators.\n\nI STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO READ THE NEW (2012/11/19) AND IMPROVED CCP-GUIDE FOR A LOT MORE INFOS ABOUT THIS MOD & INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS!!!\n\nPermitted use: \nThis product is free for non-commercial usage in Neverwinter Nights 2 only.

The Deep Halls tileset was developed to provide a more voluminous space for below ground environments, its intent is to give a feel of a dwarven made space. It was a large set complete with pit tiles and special connector tiles to seamlessly join with the OEI Caves and mines tilesets. \n\nThe Anniversary Edition has all that and more. Over the intervening years between then and now Robinson Workshop (RWS) has learned quite alot about tilesets and much of that has been incorporated into this new set.\n\nWe first set about trying to ensure that any areas you may have already built wont be damaged by using the new set. All the original tiles remain with their original names and locations within the 2da files, this means that the new tiles will seamlessly replace your old tiles, even the walkmeshes should remain uneffected.\n\nNOTICE THIS SET OVERWRITES THE ORIGINAL DEEP HALLS\n\nWe have added new tiles to the list however, and added alternate tiles to existing types. Geometry has been improved and altered slightly in many cases. The pits are twice as deep as they were in the original, giving a better feel for the depth of the chasms. There are many more variations of stairs and chasm crossers than before.\n\nIn addition to the Deep Halls set, which now numbers over 170 tiles, a smaller pocket set that has never been released has been added to this anniversary release. Grand Causeways is designed to connect the Deep Halls to not only itself but other areas in your subterranian world. Its nearly 40 tiles give the anniversary edition a tile count in excess of 214 tiles, exactly double the count of the original Deep Halls.\n\nSome new features of the Anniversary edition: \n\n>Causeway tiles\n>Improved stone textures \n>Pit tiles are now 2 1/2 time deeper than giving a better feel for the pits \n>More pit crosser tiles \n>Increased number of split level tiles \n>More metatiles \n>Lovely new spiral stairs around columns of rock in the pits \n>New column geometry \n>detail added to existing geometry \n>now includes rooms for upper level doors. However a blocker tile is included if the door is preferred to be a transition door.\n\n\nTIPS:\n\n1.Door Blocker:\nThere is a tile in the Deep Halls set labelled BLOK. it is used for when doors are intended to be a transition type as opposed to a door one walks through. Since I have included rooms for both upperlevel and of course main levels none of the doors have built-in view blocking geometry. Without the blocker tile you could see through the backside of adjacent tiles visible through the open door. The blocker tile fixes this.\n\n2. Pit Wall Placeable:\nThere are occasions where there isnt a tile available to make a special closure in the pits. for this I added a pit wall placeable. It can be seen in use in the demo-mod where the causeway bridges run along the pit wall where it enters the bridgehead metatile. This placeable should be made environmental.\n\nIssues known:\n\nThis is a big set with many tile variations, you should play with it a bit to learn the options it contains. it isnt as difficult to work with as say the shadow fortress tileset from OEI but it is more complex than most, due to its multilevel design and its sheer size.\n\nContents: \n\nThe RAR files should contain the following files: \n\ndeephalls_nx1.hak: \n\nplace this file in your \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak\" folder it contains all the textures and models required for the set.\n\nrws_deephalls_soz_2da.hak: \n\nplace this file in your \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\YOUR_LOGIN_NAME\\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\hak\" folder it contains all the 2da files used by the tileset \n\nTiles.2da: \n\nAn override of the OEI tiles.2da file.

I'm currently planning on doing some Black & White screens, but I need to find some areas to use for the art.\n\nUse these however you see fit, but do give credit.\n\n\n*** Instructions:\n\nYou need the compression utility, \"7-ZIP\" to unpack these files. 7-Zip is a great tool & can be found here (for FREE!): Link\n\n* Go to the DOWNLOAD button on the left of your screen, then select the correct version for your particular operating system.\n\nTo check out the files, install 7-Zip first. Next, right click \"Ugly_Ducks Loadscreen Pack Volume 1.7z\" and mouse over the 7-Zip option. Select \"Extract Here\". This will decompress the files and make them useable.\n\nNow, there are two things you can do (I would suggest doing just one at a time so data doesn't start 'conflicting', and what-not):\n\n1.) Very Easy. Drop \"Ugly_Ducks Loadscreen Pack Volume 1 OVERRIDE\" folder into your /My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/Override folder.\n2.) Easy. Drop \"Ugly_Ducks Loadscreen Pack Volume 1.hak\" file into your /My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/HAK folder. Open the toolset and start a module, then select \"View\" from the menu at the top left of the toolset, then from the drop-down menu, select \"Module Properties\". In the properties window that appears, go to \"Hak Packs\". From here you can select the Loadscreen Pack & assign it to the module.\n\nTo see/use the new screens AFTER using either method above, open the toolset & select and open the area you want to place a loadscreen onto. In the Properties Window, go down to \"Load Screen\" and scroll through all 50 of the new screens! They should be at the top of the screens list because of the way I numbered them - example: 001_Mountains_Crystal_001.\n\nFinally, pick the one you want, save the module, then run the module.

Next, right click \"Ugly_Ducks Terrain Texture Pack Volume 1.7z\" and mouse over the 7-Zip option. Select \"Extract Here\". This will decompress the files and make them useable.\n\nNow, place \"UDs Terrain Texture Pack Vol.1 OVERRIDE\" in your My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2/Override folder. This file contains the terrainmaterials.2da and the .dds files for the textures.\n\nThen, copy the contents of \"Texture BMP Icons\" into your Program Files/Atari/Neverwinter Nights 2/NWN2Toolset/Terrain folder. *NOTE: You CANNOT place the folder in this directory, the icons need to be placed in there outside of a subfolder for them to be recognized by the game.\n\nFinally, fire up the toolset & start texturing!\n\n*Notes:\n- Some of the textures have a high brightness level that I was unable to correct in GIMP or Photoshop. The way around this is to use a DAY.NIGHT cycle that has lower light (such as the Ashenwood Snowy cycle). This is mainly for the Ice & Snow textures, but there is a Grass texture that could benefit from this also.\n- The textures are not as 'seemless' as I would have liked them to be - I tried like hell to get them right, but they are still somewhat ridged.

It has long been a hobby of mine, and as such it was designed to reflect and enhance my personal play style.\n\nThese mods aim to:\n1. Make low-level characters more different and fun. A lot of mods take place at very low levels, where classes are poorly differentiated. In addition some classes do not gain access to what I would consider defining talents until very late in the game.\n2. Make similar base classes more different from each other in design and play.\n3. To make available character styles and archetypes that were previously only accessible through extensive multiclassing, at very high levels, or only to certain races.\n4. To force allies to work more closely with each other rather than independently.\n\nIn addition, due to the nature of this mod, several assumptions about playstyle were necessary:\n\n1. Players typically pick a base class and do not multiclass. Multiclassing is not actually disabled, and there are some very fun multiclass builds available, but no playtesting has been done and some changes make it more easy than ever to make vastly overpowered or underpowered builds. Prestige classes are currently usable (with the exception of the Shadow Dancer), but untouched. A prestige class version of the mod is currently in the works.\n\n2. Players typically play teams. In general the balance changes in this mod will result in more powerful parties but less powerful individuals. Either solo adventuring or putting your party on full AI and only controlling a single character are generally poorly supported.\n\n3. Players are not PnP purists. Although some ideas are couched from PnP RAW, extensive liberties have been taken.\n\nIf you read all of that and thought to yourself, \"Why would I ever want to play like THAT?!\" then you are of course still welcome to try out and comment on the mod, but keep in mind that what we find fun about the game may simply be irreconcilable.\n\nIf any of that sounds like fun to you, check it out and let me know what you think!\n\nSince I never expected this override to be anything except a personal hobby, I have designed it to be as maximally compatible as possible. I often like to take a party through several modules and campaigns, and I did not want to run into a module that required me to rewrite files in order to bring my established party into it.\n\nConstructive criticism is strongly appreciated, but even a note about what you did or did not like would be great.\n\nCOMING SOON:\nPrestige Classes","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"535":{"Name":"Deities of Golarion","Author":"Shayd3000","Submitted":20110424,"Updated":20110425,"Category":"Other","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is a nwn_deities replacement and custom TLK file for the core 20 Pathfinder deities.\n\nThe icons are courtesy of images from Golariopedia and descriptions courtesy of Myth Weavers.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"537":{"Name":"SOZ Update for Chaos Placeables 1.8","Author":"Shayd3000","Submitted":20110430,"Updated":20110430,"Category":"Combos - Placeables","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"These are the 2DA files and blueprints to update Chaos Placeables 1.8 to SOZ and version 1.23.\n\nChaos Placeables can be found:\n\nLink\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1.

I quickly realized that there is a dearth of decent looking rapiers. The stock game ones are pretty silly and there are very few custom ones in the vault. In fact, I only found the one in the ACME Full Metal Weapons pack (very nice) and the, somewhat eccentric, two from Lineage Arms and Armor. So I decided to make my own. This is the result, my first ever attempt at custom content. I hope you enjoy.\n\nIncluded are two rapiers -- for each a template (UTI), 3 model parts and textures (in TGA format). Rapier01 is loosely, and somewhat fancifully, based a number of 16th Century rapiers and later sabers and small swords on display at the military museum where I live. Rapier02 is modeled closely on a real English rapier I found for sale on an antique sword dealer�s website. His posted pictures formed the basis for (i.e. were copied into) the hilt and guard textures. Both rapiers have pretty high poly counts, 1100 and 700 polys respectively. They work fine on my machine though. The jewel in the hilt of Rapier01 is tintable (currently it�s an emerald).\n\nTo get these into the game, add the files to your mydocuments/nwn2/override folder, and then from within the game, open the console, type \"debugmode 1\", then \"giveitem cpr_rapier0X\", then \"debugmode 0\" and close the console.\n\nI did these on a Mac, and since there is no Mac version of the toolset, I have no idea how well these work in it, if at all. I have used model numbers 220 and 221, which I don�t believe conflict with anything. If anyone wants to update a 2da for these or create an ERF please do so and I will include them in an update. Also, I have not yet found software for Mac that will successfully save image files into DDS with Alpha channel, thus the TGA. Again, if someone wants to convert the textures to DDS, I will add them.\n\nI did the models in Cheetah3D, which I would recommend to Mac modders looking for a reasonably priced piece of modeling software � more or less easy to learn with an excellent forum help. When I get some time, I will put together a short tutorial on my workflow for custom content on a Mac (which wasn�t so easy to figure out).\n\nI must thank Barrel of Monkeys for his tutorials and Adinos and RunnerDuck for their indispensable mdb2obj and mdbcloner tools as well as to Roboius for his modified GFF Editor.\n\nFeel free to use and modify, but please give credit. Also lease let me know what you think and give me feedback.\n\nV1.1 - Per TikiHat's suggestion, added an alternative texture with a golden hilt for Rapier02. Simply replace the corresponding .tga from the original package with this one.\n","Rating":10,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"540":{"Name":"Ombra - Archmage PrC from Abeir Toril Italian Shard","Author":"1Ombra1","Submitted":20110613,"Updated":20110614,"Category":"Prestige Classes","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"--- Archmage PrC ---\n\nThis is the Archmage PrC that has been developed for the Italian NWN2 Shard \"Abeir Toril - Cronache dei Reami di Occidente\".\n\nArcmage is one of the most diffuclt classes to implement cause limitations of NWN2 engine. The PrC is not correctly/fully implemented (e.g.: Mastery of Counterspelling), we had to find some compromises in order to have a class as close as possible to PnP.\nI hope you enjoy the work we have done even if it is not exactly the same as the handbooks.\n\n--- Description ---\n\nThe archmage class has the main problem to permanently eliminate a spell slot in exchange of one of his special abilities, the High Arcana.\nThis problem was solved by implementig a list of Fake spells to fill the slots, if you don't memorize the spell on rest you cannot use the related ability, instructions are given into the documentation file.\n\nTo see the class description see the Hypertext d20 free documentation...\nLink\n\nFrom this base we have implemented this abilityes (Archmage High Arcana):\n\n- Arcane Fire: Used as a cleric spontaneous conversion. You sacrifice a 9th level spell slot.\n\n- Mastery of elements: Used to change the elemental damage type. You can change a Fireball into a Acidball or Sonicball. It works with all elemental wizard spells. You sacrifice a 8th level spell slot.\n\n- Mastery of Shaping: you can create a hole into your spells with a hostyle area, this will preserve your party members from damages taken from a Fireball as an example. You sacrifice a 6th level spell slot.\n\n- Spell Power (I-II-III): you increese your spell casting level by +1, +2 or +3. The levels are used only to determine durations, damages and level based parameters of the spell being used. In order you sacrifice a 5th, 7th, 9th level spell slot.\n\n- Spell Like Abilities: you can permanenttly convert, and sacrifice, a spell slot into a Spell Like Abilities usable 2/day. You sacrifice a 5th slot and a slot of the level of the spell converted.\n\nMore details are provided into documentation doc file.\n\n--- How to implement ---\n\nBecause of the complexity of the prestige class, implementation in a module or in a PW is a pretty tricky job (Boring I would say), some skills are required in scripting and also in nwn2 files editing as .hak, .tlk and the like.\n\nThe spells and feats definition in .2da files are compatible with other PrC projects, and used rows are reserved on NWN2Wiki.\n\nInstructions are gived in the .doc documentation.\n\n--- Credits ---\n\nThe Archmage project involved several people from Abeir Toril PW, and Vault material.\n\n* DM Puchu, Abeir Toril Back Ground Checkers and Racial Tutor for his work on .2da and .tlk files.\n* Tirro89, Abeir Toril player, for ideas and testing.\n* Suspiria87, Abeir Toril Player, for her involuntary ideas on Archmage System like Fake Spell to emulate loss of slots.\n* Vastu85, for his help in spell scripting, now working as scripter on Abeir Toril Shard.\n* Abeir Toril staff and players, for the advices given and offers of help when needed.\n* The Jeegs Training creator on Vault, as it is the base module I use to do tests.\n* Other various Authors on the vaults for Icons and spell fixes.\n* And me of course :P, Ombra, Just Promoted Scripter Coordinator on Abeir Toril.\n\n\n--- Download ---\n\nYou can download version V1.0, it is in testing on Abeir Toril PW, was tested only in a local module by me and Tirro89.\nRefer to the doc file for instructions.\nIf you have some feedback or advices contact me by comments or by Vault Profile.\n\nOmbra - CooScripter on Italian Shard \"Abeir Toril - Cronache dei Reami di Occidente\"","Rating":10,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"541":{"Name":"Human Full Beards","Author":"Raelius","Submitted":20110714,"Updated":20110714,"Category":"PC Parts","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This hak adds duplicates of two of the default human heads (head 01 - the default one - and head 24, the last thayan head), with the difference that both heads have been given the full beard from head 02.\nI duplicated the heads instead of overriding them for two reasons:\na - keep the existing facial hair of head 01.\nb - avoid backwards compatibility problems.\nHead indices are 200 and 201.\nThe hak is very small (315 KB) since the files reference existing textures.\n","Rating":9.25,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"542":{"Name":"Elven Hip Dagger Armor Attachment plus some retextures","Author":"chuckeriino","Submitted":20110714,"Updated":20110717,"Category":"Armor","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:MotB","Description":"This pack contains one new armor attachment for the right hip and some re-textures of other existing custom content I did for an Arcane Archer I have been playing in the OC.\n\nThe hip attachment is a sheathed version of Adonnay�s fabulous Elven daggers. This hip accessory was inspired by Aleanne�s hip dagger, but I thought, since my character wields Adonnay�s weapons when not arching, it would be cooler to sport Adonnay�s as her strap-on hip accessory. You must have Adonnay�s Elven Weapons pack installed for it to texture properly. It works with all six of Adonnay�s textures (default is the ebonysabre texture). Just change it to one of the others with MDBcloner or (I suppose) in the toolset. The other textures Adonnay uses for the daggers are elwoodsabre, whiteleathersabre, brightwoodsabre, cloudsabre, and ivorysabre. The hilt (and textures obviously) is Adonnay�s, the scabbard mine. Available for male and female elves, but not other races (it is an elven weapon after all). To add it to the game, use either the toolset or GFF Editor to add it to an existing armor�s .UTI file.\n\nThe other content in this package are two retextures of other existing custom content. They do override the original textures so if you don�t want them to, copy and rename the corresponding .UTI and use MDBcloner to rename the models and these textures. The original models are contained in Aleanne�s female clothing pack 4 and Wild Bills Cloaks of Faerun Pk3, which will need to be in the override for these textures to do anything.\n\nThe first re-texture adds a shirt to Aleanne�s leatherskirt. It is tintable. Aleanne uses the belt slot for the skirt part of the female outfits so the belt should to be tinted to match. The files from Aleanne�s are ale_leatherskirt.uti, P_XXX_CP_Body96.mdb and P_XXX_ CP_Belt96.\n\nThe other re-texture give�s Wild Bill�s Ghostsnow cloak a dark green/black camouflage pattern instead if the original grey/white.

The rune will be renamed, and then, when you are 20 maps away, just a spell and *zap* you're there\n\nThere are 3 custom spell in the hak :\nMark Rune & Open Gate, under a subradial of Gate (along with Summon Fiend, the original one) and Teleport.\n\nTeleport is a 6th level spell for Wiz/Sorc and Bards, and 7th for Clerics\n\nGate, as the original one, is a 9th level spell (Wiz/Sorc & Cleric).\n\nThis teleport system is designed for PWs, not for the OC, but it's useable anyway. You need to edit dialog.tlk and add names and description lines (and, of course, references in spells.2da).\nJust be very careful, cause you risk to jump, for instance, from Act 3 to Act 2, or, maybe, it does't work at all... so, in story driven modules, use it at your own risk. \n\nOriginally it worked with a conversation, and locations were stored in a DB, but it was incredibly slow and complex, not to mention the fact you're not able to use it in combat (for a quick flee, for instance). So, I tried to figure out an easier way, and it just came to my mind when I used to play Ultima Online, the Kal Ort Por and Vas Rel Por spell with marked runes...\n\nWhen a Gate is opened it will last 2 minutes. During this time, anyone can pass through, but, when used by the caster, it will close. \nTeleport is personal, so, just the caster (with henchman, familiar, summoned creatures, animal companions, and all the rest of the Brancaleone's army) will be teleported. \n\nBoth the spells can be scribed in scroll.\n\nMark spell is 9th, so, bards can't use it, but, as UO's mark, someone else can mark the rune for you. The good thing is that locations are stored in items, not in PC's reserved entry in a DB, so PCs can sell them, give them to other, allowing low level caster to use just teleport, exactly as UO's recall runes.\n\nI'm not a mapper, and I'm extremely lazy, so, testing the hak will require a module with, at least, 2 areas.\nJust put the hak and the custom TLK in your module.\n*EDIT*\nTesting module included with hak&tlk already set\n\nAs usual, \n.hak files goes in \\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights\\hak\n.tlk files goes in \\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights\\tlk\n.mod files goes in \\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights\\modules\n\nOverride version is a complete pack that goes in \\My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights\\override. Put it in a dedicated folder, in order to keep your override clean, but it's not necessary.\n\nThe script split the location in position vector, area tag and facing, so it solve the problem of changing area id in stored location, but areas must have a valid (and unique) tag. We used this script in a PW for about one year and it worked fine.\n\nWell, what else... enjoy\n\nDisclaimer : I'm italian, and, again, I'm incredibly lazy. This hak was originally designed for an Italian PW, so, if you catch any typos.. feel free to fix it. \n\nIt's marked as SoZ required, but just because I worked with SoZ's 2da. there's no problem at all in using it with just Nwn2 Base or MotB, but you'll see new spells in list (maybe without icons too). \n\n\nempty recall rune's code is \"teleport_rune\" (##giveitem teleport_rune)\nTeleport scroll is \"ma_it_sparscr_tel\"\nGate is \"ma_it_sparscr_gate\"\n\nAnything else ? well, let me know if anything goes wrong, i'll fix it as soon as possible.\n\nAnd don't forget to vote !\n\n\n\n\n Version 1.1 Available \n\nChecked 2da reserved range.

The crossbow was modeled and textured from ground up.\n\nThis pack includes:\n\n1) Dragon Breastplate: I got tired of how most games either depict dragon armor as nothing more than tinted metal, or scales, even though they insist the armor is full plate or what not. So, I decided to try and make dragon armor that actually looked like it was made from dragon scales, without becoming scale armor. Hope it worked...\nAvailable for both male and female humanoids (not orcs, dwarves or gnomes).\n\n2) Astrid Splint Mail: Named after the faction in the server it was designed for (Beldin. Check it out here: Link ). Available for both male and female humanoids (no orcs, dwarves or gnomes...sorry!).\n\n3) Scale Jacket: For women only (making up for my first submission being male only!). Again, designed for Beldin, but being released for all. Available for female humanoids (again, no orcs, dwarves or gnomes). \n\n4) Dragonbolt Heavy Crossbow: My first model. Its a semi-automatic, self reloading crossbow with a dragon head and sniper scope. \n\nThat's it for now. Critique will be much appreciated. \n\nNote: Halflings can be made to use the armor sets here, but I did not package them. Just rename them accordingly using the MDB cloner if you wan't the little people to have these things.\n\n\n\n\nThe screenshots use some material from other packs (weapons, helms, belts and accessories).

After all, you can never have enough clothing options! :)\n\nAll of my work is playtested on and added to the PW Beldin long before I upload it on the vault.\n\nI have about a half dozen 'completed' outfits, but for the moment, I'm just uploading two. The others will be uploaded soon as well.\nDrindl: NWN2 suffers from a lack of good peasant garb, or even consistent medieval looking clothing. So, I was inspired to make a nice peasant-y dress for all those lost peasant NPCs out there. This is for human and elf females, but has a male placeholder model. Most of the textures are Obsidians, with the exception of the skirt.\nGreek Tunic I forget why I made this, or why the toga has celtic designs on it, but there it is. It works on humans and elves, male and female. The base texture is from ACME tabards.\nArcher Armor As the savvy vault peruser can probably tell, this armor is a modification of one of Aleanne's \"armor\" sets. It works for male and female, since I have put one of the Shirtless Saga pants sets opposite it as the male version. The belt model was detached from the female vampire model it came from by Taurus Daggerknight.\nSaxon Dress: The title of this dress refers to the fact that the decoration for the neckline and belt was shamelessly copied from the decoration of a brooch found at the Sutton Hoo dig in England. The design of the dress itself has absolutely nothing to do actual Anglo-Saxon style, but rather the annoying quirks of the UV map of the model I picked. The dress comes in two styles: regular, and \"wing-friendly\" (low-backed). They tint slightly differently. The male model opposite it is merely the NW9 tunic with the Neverwinter Eye removed (found here: Link Other than the dragon-decoration, the textures are reused game textures and the model is likely Obsidian's.\n\nI realize the haks and overrides below are getting rather confusing. I will probably put up a proper compilation of all of this soon, but for the moment:\nFearthegn Clothing = drindl, greek tunic\nArcher armor = archer armor and accompanying belt\nDress / Saxon Dress = Saxon dress (two versions)\n\nThe item codes for using the override version in the OC are \"drindl\" and \"tunic\". The archer armor code is \"ar_archer\".

Unfortunatly, I didn't get to dedicate as much time to it as I would have liked, so there's a tad less in here, though I hope to add to it over time. \n\nWhat this pack includes: \n\nDragon Full Plate armor: Second style of Dragon Armor. This one covers the whole body. The male version is new, while the female version is the original female dragon armor. \n\nDragon Breastplate (female): This suit more closely resembles the original male dragon armor, and now goes opposite it in the armor list, switching places with the original female one. \n\nThe base model is from the ACME full metal pack.\n\n\nChessentan/ Greek breastplate: As the name says. Best used with Shirtless Saga's and the Arcane Archer skirt accessories. \n\nChessentan/ Greek Breastplate for Winged Characters: Modified version of the above. The breastplate only covers the front and lower back, with chainmail covering the upper back and legs. There are to holes in the back of the mail shirt for wings. \n\nYari: A yari spear. \n\nNaginata: A naginata spear. I will be uploading a halberd version of this later. \n\nGuandao: a chinese guan dao pole arm for the halberd slot. \n\nTrident (for spears)\n\nBlood of the Gods: Originally built specifically for Beldin. Its a glowing magic greatsword. \n\nDragon Katana: Though not quite a katana, it was still made for that slot. The blade and handle come in two styles. One blade is normal, while the other type glows orange. One of the handles is extra long, while the other type is shorter. \n\nKhopesh (scimitar sword)\n\nLyre: a lyre that fits in into the drum slot (because I couldn't think of where else to put it). It looks okay on females even while walking, though men tend to bash at it like a drum. \n\nLance: the first of a few to come. It goes into the spear slot. \n\n\n\nBest used with Dragon Pack 1.\n\nNOTE: if you do use Dragon Pack 1 with this, make sure this is higher on the hak load priority list, as it does alter a small part in the armor listing.\n\nThe screenshots use some material from other packs (weapons, helms, belts and accessories).

It�s a briefcase, suitable for carrying around important documents, as well as beating the crap out of your competition!\n\nGnolls Royce fine suit: Inspired by Gnolls Royce (played by Discopanda in the PW Sigil: City of Doors), this is a fine tuxedo suit for more civilised gnolls. \n\nHooded Death Mask: Made several years ago for use in Beldin, this helm piece was made by combining ACME's Assault and Hattery mask with a hood from Cyric the Dark's Armory. \n\nHoodie: based off of the Adventurer�s Sleeveless Hoodie found on the NWVault here: Link . The normal map is fixed to be less shiny, and there are a few other tweaks. Useable by male humans, halflings, planetouched, and elves.\n\nMonk Sparring Outfit: for those days when your female monk feels like wearing more than a sports bra. Some textures were taken from Chimneyfish�s �Ember� outfit. Useable by female humans, halflings, planetouched, and elves.\n\nSilk Dress: a more refined looking version of the Torio Claven robe.

You create an infusion of any divine spell available to you.\n\nMy NWN2 translation:\n\n\"Brew Potion\"\n- You can create a potion of any beneficial, single-target spell of 3rd level or less that you know.\n\nWell, of course one might argue about the choices that I made, so feel free to comment, but keep in mind that it's impossible to please everybody.\n\nYou'll find the biggest \"changes\", that I made documented in a .txt file in each class-folder.\n\n***\n\nA special note on \"Spell Power\" and the \"Practiced Spellcaster\" bug:\n\nContrary to the description, the extent of the Practiced Spellcaster feat is not capped by the character's hit dice, but by the number of levels in additional classes. \nNormally, the use of this feat operates as described. However, if used in conjunction with a prestige class that grants additional spellcaster levels, this feat STILL grants up to +4 caster levels and does not cap at the character's HD as it should. \n\nThis always bothered me, so along with my PrCs, I created 6 \"fake\" Spell Power feats (Spell Power 1-4 (+1 CL each) and Epic Spell Power 1-2 (+2 CL each)). \n\nThese feats won't grant you anything, but if you like to have a \"legal\" character with more CLs (except the RW) then now you can have it.\n\nExample:\nA Druid 25 / Hierophant 5 with the \"Practiced Spellcaster\" feat would have a CL of 34, which is not legal IF he didn't take any Spell Power feats. \nNow IF he takes my Spell Power feats (SP 1-4 or ESP 1-2 or SP 1-2 and ESP 1) then it would be a legal character.\n\nIn other words: Don't use my Spell Power feats for anything else than having a good feeling, knowing that you don't \"cheat\" ;) !!! \n\nNote: \nEven though the \"fake\" Spell Power feats work like I described above, I still consider them \"Under Development\", because I might change their prerequisites and/or behaviour (for example making special versions of them for each spellcasting class etc.).","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"584":{"Name":"Chalkdust Race Pack 17","Author":"chalkdust","Submitted":20121229,"Updated":20130115,"Category":"Races","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"This is the Chalkdust Race Pack. I've added several races that I want to play, incorporating some custom pseudo-dynamic model tweaking for the gith and the Lizardfolk models from Avlis2. I'm aware that some of these races are included in other race packs, but this is the selection that I want added to my own games. I don't use any other mods, but I've made an effort to make this compatible with existing mods by using my own reserved 2DA ranges and limiting changes outside of these ranges. However, I did make some adjustments to some existing lines of the 2DA files so I can't promise that everything will work properly if combined with other mods. I'm completely new to modding, so bear with me. I'm working on figuring out how to ensure full compatibility in a future release.\n\nMy criteria for inclusion in this collection:\no The race is a useful addition to the game (I would not add a subrace that is functionally identical to another subrace)\no The race can use existing dynamic (or pseudo-dynamic) character models\no Does not require advanced scripting beyond my current abilities\no Small and medium races only, consistent with what exists in-game.\no Nothing radically imbalanced (with the exception for half-celestial since it was already in the code and half-fiend for symmetry)\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n1. Ghostwise Halfling\n+2 Dex -2 Str\nFavored Class: Barbarian\nThis was an easy practice race for me when I was figuring out what to do.\n\n2. Tallfellow Halfling\n+2 Dex -2 Str\nKeen Senses\nFavored Class: Rogue\nOne reason I started modding, this race can make an EXCELLENT SoZ leader, with a Rogue/Ranger/Swashbuckler build.\n\n3. Jungle Dwarf\n+2 Con -2 Cha\nFavored Class: Ranger\nAnother easy race, alternate option for SoZ leader.\n\n4. Deep Imaskari\n+2 Int -2 Dex\nSpell clutch (su) (Bonus level 1 spell slot)\nFavored Class: Wizard\nI wanted to do a human subrace and this was the most attractive option in the lore.\n\n5. Githyanki\nCustom pseudo-dynamic character models\n+2 Dex +2 Con -2 Wis\nFavored Class: Fighter\nLA: +2\nThe other reason I started modding: I was dissappointed by the static models in other race packs.\n\n6. Githzerai\nCustom pseudo-dynamic character models\n+6 Dex +2 Wis -2 Int\nFavored Class: Monk\nLA: +2\nMy original intent was to have different heads to differentiate the gith races, but there were only two gith heads that fit all body models.\n\n7. Half-Celestial\n+4 Str +4 Con +4 Wis +4 Cha +2 Dex +2 Int\nFavored Class: Any\nLA: +4\nI've read that it's impossible to add wings at character creation. I'm currently researching whether it's possible to add wings through a custom script attached to the \"Wings\" feat. More to follow.\n\n8. Half-Fiend\n+4 Str +4 Dex +4 Int +2 Con +2 Cha\nMagic Unarmed Attack\nCustom Racial Spells\nFavored Class: Any\nLA: +4\nHalf-drow heads give a nice sinister appearance. I figured out how to create custom racial feats that launch the spells, but I'm not sure if caster level is being calculated correctly based on character level. More to follow.\n\n9. Lizardfolk\n+2 Str +2 Con -2 Int\nFavored Class: Druid\nThe Avlis2 dynamic models are brilliant and I wanted to play this race, but the version they released wasn't properly set up. I've fixed the 2DA info and assigned the svirf dodge bonus +4 and racial natural armor feat +1 as a replacement for the PnP natural armor bonus +5.\n\n10. Painted Elf\n+2 Dex, -2 Int\nFavored Class: Druid\nI needed an easy one after working with custom models, creating feats, and importing other work. This was an easy one.\n\n11. Grey Elf\n+2 Dex +2 Int -2 Str -2 Con\nFavored Class: Wizard\nThe only other elf that I liked. The two ability score boosts offer a better option for elf wizards.\n\n12. Celadrin\n+2 Dex +2 Cha -2 Con\nElf feats\nBonuses to perform and diplomacy\nFavored Class: Bard\nLA: +1\nA planetouched elf race, very solid choice for a bard or sorcerer build.\n\n13. Deathtouched\n+4 Cha +2 Wis -2 Con\nFavored Class: Sorceror\nLA: +1\nMakes a good choice for Multiple Attribute Dependent spellcasters, if you can deal with the level adjustment. Ironically, he's quite good at turning undead and would make a very conflicted, self-loathing Doomguide. Implemented as a human subrace.\n\n14. Mountain Orc\n+4 Str -2 Int -2 Wis -2 Cha\nFavored Class: Barbarian\nSolid choice for a pure tank. Don't waste your time trying to teach him magic.\n\n15. Hagspawn\n+2 Str +2 Con -2 Cha\nSpell resistance 11+level, and natural AC bonus +2\nFavored Class: Barbarian\nLA: +2\nNot as pretty as Gann, but it offers spell resistance for melee character builds. Minor alignment/clipping issues with some helms.\n\n16. Star Elf\n+2 Cha -2 Con\nFavored Class: Bard\nAn extradimesional elf race, added for the LA-free Charisma bonus. I used a special effect to add a permanent nimbus similar to the illustrations in Unapproachable East. If you want to remove this effect, it's the last column of the racialsubtypes 2DA.\n\n17. Spellscale\n+2 Cha -2 Con\nFavored Class: Sorceror\nAnother LA-free Charisma race.\n\n\n************\nFor anyone who wants to modify, reuse, repurpose, or otherwise tinker with this mod: go ahead. Most of the real work was done by others. I just tinkered. Most of my changes are limited to the following ranges:\n\nTLK RANGES 16001-16999\nAPPEARANCE RANGES 800-999\nRACIAL SUBTYPES 70-99\nFeats 9901-10000\n\nIf you just want the gith models to make your own gith characters more dynamic, simply download the \"CD_gith\" folder and set your gith body and head models to \"P_GY?\" in the appearance 2DA. Known limitations: the models won't show helmets, gloves, or boots, and there is currently no robed male or armored female. I'll add them if I can find satisfactory models.\n************\n\nCredits:\nMonster Manual 3.5\nUnapproachable East\nRaces of the Dragon\ndandwiki\nCrystal Keep 3.5 Race Index\nAvlis2 Lizardfolk models","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"585":{"Name":"Pack Romano-Sarmate","Author":"HiPPiaS","Submitted":20130202,"Updated":20130204,"Category":"Armor","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"(English below)\n\nLe pack Romano-Sarmate ici présent inclus des modèles créés spécifiquement pour la campagne solo de Claudius33 « Sarmates ! ».

Vous la trouverez en tant que torche, variante 60. Vous pouvez également l�importer dans l�éditeur grâce à l�erf « Draco.erf » fournis .\n\nL�armure Sarmate est une armure d�écaille issue de nwn2 qui a été raccourcie. Vous la trouverez dans la catégorie « armure d�écaille », variante 120.\n\nL�armure d�été romaine est une armure de cuir issue de nwn2 jambes et bras nus. Vous la trouverez dans la catégorie « Armure de Cuir », variante 120.\n\nLa toge est un vêtement masculin romain obtenue à partir du modèle Greek Tunik par Mimi Fearthegn. [url]\nVous le trouverez dans la catégorie « Vetements », variante 120. Ce modèle un peu spécial s�utilise avec une paire de gants que vous trouverez dans la catégorie « vetements », variante 120. Vous pouvez également utiliser l�erf « Toge.erf » pour simplifier l�intégration à l�éditeur.\n\nLe peplos est un vêtement féminin romain obtenu à partir du célèbre modèle de Jester [url].Vous pourrez le trouver dans la catégorie « Vetements », variante 120.\n\nPour ces différents vêtements, des sandales peuvent être du plus bel effet. Celles utilisées dans Sarmates ! proviennent du pack Shirtlesse Saga II pour les hommes [url] et du pack d�aleanne II pour les femmes [url].\n\n\nRemerciements :\n\nAucun de ces modèles n�auraient pu être réalisés sans la confiance de Claudius33 qui par ses demandes m�a permis de me fixer des objectifs, un grand merci à lui.\n\nRemerciement également à Jester pour son modèle féminin ainsi qu�à Ardell, Olblach et Duskwind qui ont collaboré avec lui à la réalisation du très bon plugin d�import-export pour Blender. [url]\n\nTout aurait été plus difficile (voir impossible) sans les très bons tutos de Krighaur, merci à lui.\n\nEnfin, merci à Zoune et Serenera pour leur soutien moral pendant ces longues périodes de réalisation.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------\n\n\nMy Roman-Sarmate pack contains models specifically created for Claudius33's single player campaign « Sarmates ! ». [url]\nIt is meant for moders willing to enhance their models collection.\n\nIt includes a Draco (Sarmatian banner), a Sarmatian warrior suit, a summertime Roman legionary's armor, a toga and a roman peplos. \n\nThe models required by Claudius were real challenges, as I was beginning 3D modeling. Therefore the overall quality may be rather variable.\n\nNevertheless I hope they suit you and that you will have a lot of fun with our Roman and Sarmatian friends.\n\nHiPPiaS \n\n\nIn details :\n\nThe Draco is a Sarmatian banner. The model is a 'torch', number 60. You may also import it into the toolset using the supplied « Draco.erf » erf file. \n\nThe Sarmatian armor is made of a shortened NWN2 scale mail armor. Number 120, category 'scale mail'.\n\nThe toga is a Roman male suit designed from the Greek tunic model made by Mimi Fearthegn. [url]\nYou can find the model, category \"Clothing\", number 120. The model should be used with the gloves found category \"clothing\", number 120. You may take advantage of the « Toge.erf » erf file to bring it in the toolset..\n\nThe peplos is a female suit made of the famous Jester model [url]. Find it category \"Clothing\", number 120.\n\nFor a top notch effect use sandals. The sandals used in Sarmates! are available in the Shirtless Saga II pack for men [url] and in the Aleanne II pack for women -url-.\n\n\nCredits :\n\nNone of these models would have been designed, hadn't Claudius33 entrusted me with their designs. His requirements allow me to set up my own goals, a huge thank to him.\n\nI also wish to thank Jester for his female model and Ardell, Olblach, Duskwind as well, for working with him on the import export plug-in for Blender. [url]\n\nAll would have been very hard, even impossible, hadn't I taken advantage of Krighaur's excellent tutorials, a big thank to him.\n\nFinally, thanks to Zoune and Serenera for their support during the long achievement period.
