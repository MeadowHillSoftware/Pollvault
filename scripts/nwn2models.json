I think that the last one is the best looking of the three.\n\nI Hope you like it.\n\nNOTE: I have realized that there are some clipping issues if you use the last model on an NPC and get far away from him, this is because i tried to adjust the upper side of the hood as much as possible to the head. As long as you use the hood on your main PC this should not happen.\n\nUPDATE 2/09/2007\n\nWork In Progress, Hood v2.0:\n\nI decided to give the hood a little bit of additional detail, this time i used 3d studio 8.0 to smooth the hood a little and reshape it. This has augmented the polycount, of course.\n\nThere's an additional issue, the hood looks fine ingame, but when you look at it on the inventory screen, looks like some faces of the model become transparent, i have attached a screenshot, but the quality is not so good. If anyone has an idea about how to solve this, please contact me.\n\nBear in mind that this, even when it's useable in game, is still a WIP, i would like to rewrite the vertex weights to give the hood a more natural look when the head moves, a little bit more of reshaping would be a good idea, too, and i think that i need to find a solution for the inventory screen issue to consider this finished.","Rating":9.17,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"68":{"Name":"Fey's Spear model pack","Author":"Feydakin","Submitted":20070829,"Updated":20071204,"Category":"NWN2 Model Contest","Forum Thread":"Link","Polycount":"medium","ModelFormat":"Obsidian Standard","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This pack contains 6 new spear models, of varying styles, as well as examples of each new model.

However, every time I played it, the standard dual-sword animations irked the living, er, braziers out of me. I kept thinking that if you just inverted the daggers, it would look a lot better.\n\nWhen I saw the recent submissions of all-new, inverted dagger models, I figured it shouldn't be that hard to twist the original ones around... so I did, and the results were surprisingly good. The fighting looks decidedly more underhanded, backstabbing and throat-slashing with the blades inverted.\n\nThis is a primitive hack. I've just turned the dagger models 180 degrees in both the x and y dimensions using Adinos' excellent MDB Manipulation tool. Anyone with a bit of basic modding experience could do it, and if there's a smarter way, I'd be glad to hear of it.

I started this guy all the way back in January of '07, and though he was conceived of as a quick creature project to get my feet wet, he's been shelved over and over again throughout, as I found myself unable to proceed or forced to shift my focus elsewhere. I first decided to create a Clay Golem because I felt it was a relatively 'safe' choice, and that an official version would not be soon forthcoming. Alas, Mask of the Betrayer is out and NWN2 fans are graced with an official Clay Golem model.\n\nBy the time I learned that my Clay Golem was redundant, it was essentially complete, so a public release has always been my intention. Finally, here he is, and I hope that you're able to find some use for him! \n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, he's got some optional equippable bits, and is quite tintable. \n\nKnown Issues: \nWalkRight and WalkLeft (strafing) animations are a bit janky. \nThough an AnimTag xml file is included, the game doesn't seem to use it. Until I can ferret out the issue, it seems that sound effects like footsteps, attack hits, and attack misses will not play. \nGolem skeleton does not have an ap_halo node. This causes chat text spoken by the Golem to appear at his feet, and may affect how visual effects are applied to the model. \nGolem skeleton does not have an ap_camera node. This can lead to non-optimal camera angles during 'cinematic' dialogue. \nPossibly related to the lack of ap_camera, the Clay Golem does not have a default 3d portrait. For this reason, it must use a custom portrait image (included, as po_claygolem.tga). \n","Rating":9.89,"Votes":37,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"130":{"Name":"Kaycei's Hair","Author":"Kaycei","Submitted":20071130,"Updated":20080501,"Category":"NWN2 Model Contest","ModelFormat":"Obsidian Standard","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Female Hairstyle for the following races: Dwarfs, Elves (including drow and wild), Gnomes, Halflings, Half-Elves, Humans, Aasimar, Air Genasi, and Tieflings.\n\nPlease let me know if there is interest in any of the other races.","Rating":9.58,"Votes":38,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"131":{"Name":"Kuo-Toa Merchant/Trader","Author":"WhoKilledKubrick?","Submitted":20071130,"Updated":20080401,"Category":"NWN2 Model Contest","Polycount":"2800","ModelFormat":"Obsidian Standard","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Koa-Toa 'Merchant' creature model with a few animations. \n\nAt time of this release this model can be used as a merchant or trader.\n\nNow Includes Tinting Options:\nSkin = Creature Skin\nArmor1 = Arm Bands\nArmor2 = Loincloth\n\n\nI still need a proper NWN2 normal map formula for z-mapper, as i'm unsure of many of the normal/tangent/bi-tangent values used by the NWN2 render engine.

I have alot of models to go through, and I just can't do it all and expect to finish working on the new content too, well not in an acceptable amount of time anyways! This is a universal readme, I've put it with each model type download assuming not everyone will try all of them. I'll be adding more to the list of beta test downloads, so check back often. I have ALOT more plants and other things to upload as I get them ready for you to test. I've divided these up by plant type because there are so many MDB's, and it is easier for me to upload each plant type as I finish working on it for you to test. Once we finish beta testing, everything will be packaged together and become the NWN2 Foliage Pack 3. Also note this pack doesn't just contain plants! I have quite a few surprises for you in the final package!\n\nPlace them, tint them, scale them, make them dance, I don't care, do what you do and see how they work out for you. Currently, the default normal maps I have applied give the best overall lighting outdoors with minimal darkening on the underside of leaves. The Alternate Normal Maps folder ( for some plant types ) contains alternate normal map textures, just make sure you have a copy of the default ones before you overwrite them with the alts. The alternate normal maps may give you better lighting results indoors, or under certain conditions depending on your design. Test these, let me know what works and what doesn't work for you. I will include the alternate normal maps in the final package once you help me decide whats best.\n\nThe Placeables 2DA is in MoTB format, and has all the Beta plants listed in alphabetical order. Just drop it in the override folder along with the MDB and textures you want to test. I did it this way so you don't have to keep changing to a different 2da for each plant type.\n\nPlease make sure to test in the toolset AND in game to rule out issues that could be present in the toolset.\n\nAlso feel free to give me new ideas or requests for specific things!\n\nThe items currently available were from my NWN2 Foliage Pack 1 and 2, and have been optimized or recreated. Tint maps have been added, and the textures have been cleaned up with better alpha and a few textures have been added. All the files have been renamed to hopefully resolve any conflicts solet me know if any arise please! \n\n Its a real pain taking your own pictures of leaves or what not, cleaning it up, removing the background and prepping it for alpha, but it is fun. Most of my own work is applied to the new plant models which I havent uploaded just yet, but I think you'll be happy with them. I included 1 picture of \" things you find when looking for plants to take pictures of in the spring. Its available as a seperate download just for laughs.\n\nIncoming uploads as they are ready to be tested:\n\nCactus models\nSpecific Fern models ( Giant Fern, Autum Fern, etc )\nMore rocks, actually walkable rocks\nVases with flowers\nOutdoor garden statues ( pleaee feel free to request these if you need something particular! )\nOutdoor flower boxes, windowsill type and larger ones for small flower gardens\nQuite a few surprises I won't tell you about, but they will be in the full NWN2 Foliage Pack 3 package\n\nFeed back from you testers is what I need most right now, so feel free to email me: snakebane@gamers-elite.net : or leave a reply on the vault download page. Please provide as much detail as you can when you find a problem. Area type ( indoor/outdoor ) lighting condition ( time of day for outdoor, type of lights for indoor ). Also let me know what kind of graphics settings you run for textures, shadows, all of that, as I've tried to make the models and textures to be universally compatible and good looking for low end users as well us high end users. You get the idea, thanks for helping me with this most of all!\n\nSnakebane\n\nexcuse any typos, I'll clean it up in the end of beta :)\n\n","Rating":9.85,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"145":{"Name":"Rust Monster","Author":"Arpharazon","Submitted":20080518,"Updated":20090601,"Category":"Creatures","ModelFormat":"Obsidian Standard","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is the rust monster made from NWN I by Fenmarel&BrentAnderson&ElMagnificoUno.

When Heracles was sent to kill the hydra, he found that not only did the creature have nine heads to start with, it grew two new heads for each one he crushed with his club. Eventually, he eliminated the monstrous serpent, but not without help from his nephew Iolaus.\n\nThe hydra presented here is a poor cousin to the one that Heracles fought. Because of limitations in the NWN2 engine, this creature sports only five heads and does not have the ability to grow new ones. Nevertheless, it is definitely inspired by Greek mythology and bears little resemblance to the D&D version.\n\n\nWhich File to Download?\n\nIf you have never downloaded version 1.01 of the Lernean Hydra, the file to download is Hydra_v_1_2.zip. It contains all the creature's models, skeletons, animations, textures, and sample 2DA files, as well as a custom portrait.\n\nIf you have already downloaded version 1.01 of the hydra, you may download HydraPatch_v1_01_to_v1_2.zip instead. The contents of this file are intended to replace the old skeleton and animations of the previous version. The patch file will not work with version 1.0 of the hydra.\n\n\nInstructions for Use\n\nUnpack the contents of the zip file to your override folder. Sample appearance.2da and wingmodel.2da files are provided for your convenience.\n\nIn the toolset, drop any creature in an area and change its Appearance to _Hydra or _HydraTintable. The former is non-tintable, and the latter is tintable. The non-tintable version has better colors because some of the subtlety of coloration is lost in making tintable textures.\n\nUnder the creature's properties, set Wings to HydraTongue. This will give the creature a forked tongue that will flicker in and out.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you change the creature's Custom Portrait to po_hydra because the default game-generated portrait is not very good.\n\nPlease note that the number of heads that this hydra has is fixed at five. Because of the game engine's limitations, the hydra cannot grow new heads.\n\n\nRecommended Files\nIf you want to add breath weapons to the hydra, look no further than Dan Pigdon's Hydra Breath Effects. He did an awesome job creating the scripts and vfx to go with the hydra model.\n\n\nVersion History\n30 May 2012, v. 1.2: Corrected the orientation of the attachment points at the hydra's mouths to allow proper use of spell cone effects. Corrected the tongue flicking animation, which got messed up in version 1.01. Cloned the general spellcasting animations to create the attack spellcasting animations.\n\n29 May 2012, v 1.01: Added attachment points to the four other mouths of the hydra (ap_hand_left, ap_hand_right, ap_foot_left, and ap_foot_right) to allow custom breath weapon effects to be attached. Improved some of the original animations and added a new breath attack animation. In appearance.2da, changed the size of the selection capsule to 6. (Thanks to DannJ for that improvement.)\n\n27 May 2012, v 1.00: First upload of the hydra","Rating":9.71,"Votes":8,"Awards":[]},"238":{"Name":"Giant Snake","Author":"Frank Perez (aka Elysius)","Submitted":20120531,"Updated":20120604,"Category":"Creatures","Forum Thread":"Link","Polycount":"1348","ModelFormat":"Obsidian Standard","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Long a symbol of deception, betrayal, and death, the snake is a reclusive creature that doesn't deserve its bad rap. Nevertheless, it inspires fear in people, making it a good monster to have in a computer game. Giant snakes are scary, and venomous snakes are scarier, so why not terrorize your players with a giant, venomous snake? It's double the size of an anaconda, and more than double the threat of a cobra.\n\nThis simple creature was the starting point for my Lernean hydra. While I was making the latter, some people expressed interest in the single-headed model. The giant snake is suitable for many kinds of stories -- Biblical epics, rainforest horror, high altitude thrillers, boy wizard rip-offs, and hot Freudian fantasies, to name a few.\n\n\nInstructions for Use\nUnpack the contents of the zip file to your override folder. The giant snake's files are compatible with those of my previously uploaded Lernean hydra, so it's all right to overwrite the latter with the former.
