They can�t install the files to a wrong\n folder.\n \n* The players will just download the missing files! This will be a big plus,\n when the PW modules reach a size of 100+ Mbytes.\n \n* The program is supporting the 7z Format and can decompress this files during\n the download.

So you need to go to the website of the module, find the file, donwload them and put them in the right folder.\n\nIn order to overcome this annoyance, Lyncya team (RP module in developpement), more specifically our coder Amphiprion, worked on that. And he has finally created an universal connexion client.\n\n\"What's that ?\" could you ask me. This tool will allow builders to list their module by putting modules files (those necessary for the player to connect). This communautary program will allow the player to get any files from any modules that are using this connexion client.\n\nIndeed, the client lists all modules that have subscrided in this register and the player has only to chose the one he is interested in and to click on \"Launch\". The client will download the last version files (hak, pwc, trx, xml) and put them in the right place, according to the configuration on the web site.\n\nWe want to emphazise on the fact that, it is not at all a module list aimed at describing modules to visitors. It is mainly a technical tool intended to the builders. Presently, there is enough modules description list.\n\nThe only information the player will get by looking at the module list is if his favorite module is using the client. It's up to him if he desired to download and use that client.\n\nThe client load less than 500ko and is installed/uninstalled properly, withtout leaving trace (files, folders..)\n\nWe commit ourself to update this program in order to better adapte it to all the users expectations (players and builders). Thus, we invite you to come and tell your ideas or anything that would concern this program, on the lyncya forum : (look at link in the end)\n\nYou will also find at this adress, a complete documentation of the connexion client.\n\nTo conclude, you must know that we are very reactiv and that we will update it when necessary. All that, once more thanks to Amphiprion, our national coder that we have confined in a carton box with some holes to breath. He is only fed with yoghourt, peanut (hazelnuts are too big for the holes) and spaghetti. Thus, there is no risk for him to escape.\n\nSo ?! Isn't life beautiful ?\n\nwww.nwn2mu.com\n\nThank you for your attention, good game et see you soon on Lyncya forum \n\n########################################\n\nBonjour � tous les joueurs et concepteurs de NeverWinter Nights 2.\n\nSuite � la sortie du jeu et la mise en ligne des premiers modules, vous avez tr�s certainement constat� qu�il est d�sormais n�cessaire, pour jouer, de t�l�charger certains fichiers propres au module de destination.\n\nCertes, cela n�est ni insurmontable ni compliqu�, mais reste n�anmoins frustrant quand � la fin de la cr�ation de votre tout beau tout nouveau personnage, vous vous lancez pour d�buter l�aventure et que l�� Mis�re!\n\nVous voil� tout bonnement �ject� du serveur.

Les joueurs s'y rendant n'obtiendront aucune information sur le serveur en lui m�me, pas m�me un lien vers le site ou forum de ce serveur. Il y a suffisement d'annuaires int�ressants en ligne Wink\n\nLa seule information qu'un joueur obtiendra en consultant la liste des serveurs sera de constater si son serveur favori utilise le client.\nCharge � lui de t�l�charger et d'installer le client et simplement de choisir un serveur dans la liste.\n\nLe client p�se moins de 500ko et s'installe/d�sinstalle sans laisser de trace(raccourci/fichier).\n\nNous nous engageons � faire �voluer ce programme, afin de mieux r�pondre aux attentes de tous ses utilisateurs (joueurs comme concepteurs).

This first version is only partially tested and unlikely to be fit for final use.\nDescription\nThe contextmenu.xml is the UI file that determines what appears on the right-click menu in Neverwinter Nights 2.

Unfortunately the in game xml parser is very permissive, which has lead to the majority of the UI code being un-parsable by third party programs. This program fills the gap by tidying up xmls files.\n Firstly this means the UI xml files will highlight properly in a text editor that knows how to syntax highlight xml. If you do any UI editing this is reason enough to use this program.\n Secondly it means you could use an xml viewer, or write a program that manipulates the xml. In other words it is a step in the right direction toward a graphical NWN2 UI editor.\n\n Well Formed Vs Valid NWN2 UI\n This program supports two kinds of output: valid NWN2 UI and; well formed xml.\n It is not possible for a file to be both a well formed xml document (properly parsable) and work in game. The reason is that the in game parser does not accept xml files with a proper document root. Even so, using this program to tidy up the default xml will improve syntax highlighting in a text editor such as ConTEXT.\n It is anticipated that most users of this program will just want tidier valid NWN2 UI xml code, for improved syntax highlighting. It can be used to do just that, no problem.\n However, if you have a need to produce well formed xml, you can do so, and then convert that code back to a valid NWN2 UI when you are done manipulating it. Furthermore you are free to use the source code provided in your own programs!\n\n Installation\n Unzip to any location. \n\n Useage\n To convert your first UI file:\n * From the menu bar select File->Open\n * Navigate to the .xml file you want to convert. By default these can be found in C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\UI\\default\n * From the menu bar select Transform->Transform XML - NWN2 Style\n * From the menu bar select File-Save As\n * Save the file in your custom UI folder. By default that is in My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\UI\\custom\n * You can now view the modified xml in your favorite text viewer.\n\n To convert to well formed xml, select Transform->Transform XML - V 1.0 compliant.\n\nEditor\nI recommend ConTEXT as an editor for UI development as it syntax highlights well and closes the file handles so you can keep a scene open for editing while testing in game.\n\n Changelog\n V 1.02 - Added batch processing for transforming many files at once.\n V 1.01 - Handles encodings other than utf-8; remembers the open file directory\n V 1.00 - Initial release\n","Rating":8.75,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"37":{"Name":"MDB Cloner","Author":"RunnerDuck","Submitted":20070324,"Updated":20080601,"Category":"Modelling","Patch":"1.03","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"After renaming and retexturing dozens of what was essentially the same model, I decided to make this tool for fast renaming and retexturing of models.

Basically, it takes one or more .nss files as input, generates the corresponding compiled files (.ncs files) and displays any compilation error on the command-line interface.\n\nnssclc relies on some of the toolset DLLs to do the actual compilation work. From this specificity comes its two main features:\n- Stand alone - nssclc can work on computers where Neverwinter Nights 2 is not installed, it's only a matter of copying a few files from your NWN2 installation.\n- Standard - Generated files and compilation errors are exactly the same as the ones you would get in the toolset.\n\nTypical use cases for this program are:\n- NWScript validator for text editors - Check from within your favorite text editor if the code you just wrote has errors. Configuration instructions for many popular text editors are included in chapter \"Installation\". Additional nwscript support for your text editor (syntax highlighting, autocomplete and more) can be installed from Fancy Colors.\n- Various compilation works - Automatize mass-compilation of .nss files for a persistent world, compile one huge script that for a reason or another causes stability problems in the toolset...\n\nWhat nssclc Is Not\n\nAs nssclc is more or less a \"wrapper\" for the compilation functionality available in the toolset, don't expect the produced compiled files to be \"lighter\", \"faster\", or any kind of \"better compiled\" thing. Furthermore, any shortcomings to the actual NWScript compilation in the toolset will most likely be lurking in nssclc too.\n\nEven if some text editors have plugin architectures, nssclc is not a plugin nor does it include one. To be used from within a text editor, we will use a functionality more widely available (and which doesn't require specific code on my side), the possibility to call external programs.\n\nVersion History\n\n1.04 - 16/05/2009 - Feature release: several #include directories and source files can be specified, force and verbose parameters added, underlying parameter parser (Ndesk.Options) changed, localization capabilities, French localization added, license changed.\n1.03 - 08/04/2008 - Feature release: includedir parameter added, exit codes added.\n1.02 - 02/03/2008 - Maintenance release: bug fix (if output folder specified, it would prevent compilation if it already existed).\n1.01 - 20/01/2008 - Maintenance release: bug fix (file extension in upper case would prevent compilation), exit codes changed.\n1.00 - 12/01/2008 - Initial release.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nCe qu'est nssclc\n\nnssclc (acronyme correspondant à NSS Command-Line Compiler) est un compilateur « autonome » pour fichiers source NWScript (fichiers .nss), disponible sous forme d'un programme en ligne de commande. Ce programme prend un ou plusieurs fichiers .nss en entrée, génère les fichiers compilés correspondants (fichiers .ncs) et affiche les éventuelles erreurs de compilation sur l'interface de ligne de commande.\n\nnssclc s'appuie sur plusieurs DLLs de l'éditeur pour réaliser la compilation proprement dite. De cette particularité proviennent ses deux principales caractéristiques :\n- Autonome - nssclc peut être utilisé sur des ordinateurs sur lesquels Neverwinter Nights 2 n'est pas installé, il suffit de copier quelques fichiers provenant d'une installation de NWN2.\n- Standard - Les fichiers générés ainsi que les erreurs de compilation détectées sont exactement les mêmes que ceux obtenus sous l'éditeur officiel.\n\nLes utilisations typiques de ce programme sont les suivantes :\n- Valideur NWScript pour éditeurs de texte - Vérifiez depuis votre éditeur de texte préféré si le code que vous venez d'écrire contient des erreurs. Le chapitre « Installation » contient des instructions de configuration pour de nombreux éditeurs de texte. D'autres fonctionnalités dédiées au support du nwscript (coloration syntaxique, autocomplétion) peuvent être obtenu sous votre éditeur de texte en installant Fancy Colors.\n- Travaux divers de compilation - Automatiser une compilation de masse de fichiers .nss pour un module persistant, compiler un gros script qui pose des problèmes de stabilité sous l'éditeur du fait de sa taille, etc.\n\nCe que nssclc n'est pas\n\nComme nssclc se contente plus ou moins « d'encapsuler » la fonctionnalité de compilation de l'éditeur, ne vous attendez pas à obtenir des fichiers compilés « plus légers », « plus rapides », ou quoi que ce soit de « mieux compilés » par rapport à l'éditeur. De plus, tout problème ou inconvénient relatif au compilateur de l'éditeur a de grandes chances de se retrouver aussi dans nssclc.\n\nPar ailleurs, bien qu'un certain nombre d'éditeurs de texte permettent l'utilisation de plugins, nssclc lui-même n'est pas un plugin et l'archive à télécharger n'en contient pas. Afin d'utiliser nssclc depuis un éditeur de texte, nous mettrons à profit une fonctionnalité beaucoup plus répandue (et ne nécessitant pas de code supplémentaire de ma part !), qui est la possibilité de lancer des programmes externes.\n\nHistorique des versions\n\n1.04 - 16/05/2009 - Nouvelles fonctionnalités : plusieurs dossiers #include et fichiers source peuvent être indiqués, paramètres force et verbose ajoutés, analyseur pour les paramètres (Ndesk.Options) changé, fonctionnalité de localisation ajoutée, localisation française ajoutée, licence changée.\n1.03 - 08/04/2008 - Nouvelles fonctionnalités : paramètre includedir ajouté, codes de sortie ajoutés.\n1.02 - 02/03/2008 - Maintenance : correction de bogue (si un dossier de sortie était indiqué et qu'il existait déjà, la compilation n'était pas réalisée).\n1.01 - 20/01/2008 - Maintenance : correction de bogue (si une extension de fichier en majuscule était trouvée, la compilation n'était pas réalisée), codes de sortie changés.\n1.00 - 12/01/2008 - Version initiale.","Rating":9.96,"Votes":25,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"55":{"Name":"Plugin Version Fixer","Author":"Kethlak","Submitted":20080116,"Updated":20080122,"Category":"Editing","Patch":"1.12","NWN2Game":"NWN2","Description":"If you are having problems with plugins that have either been abandoned or have authors (like me) who don't play often enough to get the latest patch quickly and don't recompile their plugins in a timely manner, this file may help you.

It will apply to all plugins, whether you want it to or not. It is possible that some older plugins may not work due to changes made with the various patches. For plugins such as my Flamewind Conversation Editor XML Importer/Exporter, though, where no code change is necessary to update the file (only a recompile is needed), this will help you use the plugins with the new patch without waiting for the author to recompile it. The zip file includes two files, one named \"NWN2ToolsetLauncher.exe.config\" which is the one that actually redirects the toolset launcher program, and one named \"NWN2ToolsetLauncher.exe.config.help.txt\" which describes how to use the first file.

It is a system designed to allow a builder or PW operator to update their world with new item recipe information without having to restart their NWN2 Server, and without having to create new items using the toolset (requiring the module to be rebuilt). It doesn�t require any modified .2da files, nor updates to scripts for new items to be available for crafters. There are no arbitrary trade skills added to the mix, and there are no requirements to have crafting feats in order to craft items (meaning, non-mages can craft items too!). Each item has its own skill bonuses, difficulty, and level requirement for crafting. Item recipes can also be shared with others and imported into your own game, even while it is running.\n\nWhat this package allows you to do:\nIf you have custom items in your module that you want players to be able to create, you can enter the information necessary for the creation to take place. You can also create items that don�t have properties, but have the creation recipe add them. For instance, you create a standard longsword (NW_WSWLS001) and add the properties +1 to STR and +2 Fire damage to this standard item � without having to create a new item with the toolset!

If you are using the sample copy of the ServerList.txt and Settings.txt files, they must be placed in the same folder as the application executable. Otherwise a blank ServerList.txt and a default Settings.txt file will be created when the application is first run.\n\nThis application requires the .NET 2.0 framework and an internet connection to work. It does not need to be run on the same computer as Neverwinter Nights is installed on, but will not be able to launch either version of Neverwinter Nights if it is not.\n\n\nNickD's Awesome Server Tracking Information\n===========================================\nThe application will run invisibly, with an icon appearing in the notification tray after the server list is first loaded and refreshed. The time it will take to load depends on the number of servers in the list, the speed it reads the online servers and the number of offline servers in the list. \n\nThe server list can be displayed in a popup balloon by right clicking on the notification tray icon and selecting the Server List menu option. This will display the servers and their status. Only the first 255 characters will be displayed in this way, so only about 7 to 10 servers will be displayed. The order of the list depends on how the list is currently sorted, with the default order being the order they are in the Server List edit screen. \n\nAlternatively the list can be displayed on the screen either by right clicking on the notification tray icon and selecting the Show menu option or double clickin on the notification tray icon. The screen itself contains the full list of servers in the top left grid and information about the currently selected server at the bottom. The grid on the right is for the player list. The player list is not automatic and needs to be set up online and linked to within the Edit Server List screen. To hide the screen again, either minimise the screen, click on the Hide button or select the Hide menu option from the notification tray icon menu.\n\nTo close the application completely, either select the Exit menu item from the screen File menu or notification tray icon menu or click on the x button at the top right of the screen.\n\nTo refresh the list manually, click on the Refresh button on the screen or select Refresh from the menu. Otherwise the list will automatically refresh periodically, as set up in the Edit Settings screen (defaulted to 5 minutes). Hovering your mouse pointer over the Refresh button will pop up a tool tip informing you of when the last refresh occured.\n\nThe server details section at the bottom of the screen contains relevant information about the server as extracted from the server itself. It also contains additional information as set up in the Edit Server List screen for each server. The Online/Offline value is the time the server went offline or came online. This will be set to Since Startup if the status of the server hasn't changed since the application was started. Hovering your mouse pointer over the time online/offline will pop up a tool tip informing you of when the application was started. Next to the time online/offline is the amount of time the server has been online or offline. If the status hasn't changed since startup, this will only be the amount of time since the application was started. The link at the bottom right is maintainable in the Edit Server List screen. This is a hyperlink, using whichever browser is set as the browser in the Edit Settings screen (default Internet Explorer). The Launch button will perform a direct connect to the server. This will only work for NWN1 servers that are online and if NWN1 is installed on the machine.\n\nIf a server has a player list set up, the player list can be displayed in 3 different formats, depending on how the server has decided to define their online player information. The preferred method is for servers to make available the information in a predefined format (PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR MORE INFORMATION IF REQUIRED). Other options are a custom list if a server would like to display information in a different format and a website, which links directly to a webpage.\n\nMenu\n====\nFile:\nUnder the file menu is a Launch submenu, from which NWN1 and NWN2 can be launched if they are installed. These options will just launch the games, not the currently selected server. \n\nEdit:\nThis menu is where the edit screens for the application are opened from. \n\nEdit Server List\n----------------\nThis screen contains the servers' set up information. To add a new server to the list, select New (Ctrl-N) from the File menu. To delete and existing server from the list, select Delete (Ctrl-D) from the File menu. To edit a server already in the list, make the changes in the details section and click on Save (Ctrl-S). The server list loads in the order that they appear in the Edit Server List screen. To re-order the list, use the up and down arrows to the right of the list on this screen.\n \n* IP Address: This is the IP Address of the server.\n* Port: This is the port of the server. Entering the IP Address and Port and clicking on the Test button will check if the server is online and inform the user. If the server is online and the Server Name is blank, it will put the name of the server in the Server Name box. \n* Server Name: This is the default name of the server. If the server is offline in the server list, this is the name that will be displayed.\n* NWN Version: This is used to determine if the server is a NWN1 or NWN2 server. \n* Website: This allows the user to put a website link in the server details.\n* Player List: This is the location of the player list. This will be an online text file or a website. \n* Player List Type: This determines what format the player list is in. \n\nEdit Settings \n-------------\nThis screen contains three options for settings that apply to the application.\n\n* Auto Popups: This determines what kind of automatic popups appear in the balloon popup when the server list is refreshed. This is defaulted to None.\n* Refresh Rate: This determines the amount of time (in minutes) between each automatic update.\n* Browser: This determines which browser to use within the application. Right clicking on the box will pop up a context menu of browsers. If the browser required is neither Internet Explorer or Firefox, then the broswer application can be selected with the Find menu option. \n\nView:\nThis menu contains options to perform a manual refresh, slim the application, so only the server list is displayed and reload the server list. Reloading the server list is only useful if editing the server list and settings files by hand. Editing the files through the edit screens will automatically update the application.\n\nNotes\n=====\n* The more servers held in the server list, the slower the initial load and the refresh will be. That, in conjunction with the limited space for the Server List popup, it is recommended that no more than a dozen servers are tracked with this tool, although there is no enforced limit.\n* I am always open to more suggestions.\n\nKnown Issues\n============\n* The Balloon Text can only be 255 characters long. This means only around 7 to 10 (depending on the length of the server names) servers being tracked will be displayed in the server list popup balloon.\n* The ServerList.txt file will cause problems if it cannot resolve a line. i.e., your line must have 3 pipe characters (|) in it or start with \"--\", and there cannot be any blank lines. Because of this, it is now much better to use the edit screen than trying to manually edit the ServerList.txt file.\n* WebPage refresh.\n\nFuture Releases\n===============\n* Favourite players\n* Server List filters\n* Better validation and error checking\n* Disable servers (an alternative to deleting)\n* Help File\n\nCurrently Deemed Impossible\n===========================\n* Getting the player list from the server itself.\n* Performing a direct connect to a NWN2 server via command line parameters. \n\nDismissed Ideas\n===============\n* Direct connection to a database to determine players online. While this would make the player list more real time, it could very easily kill a database.\n* Emailling alerts to users. This could easily get far too spammy.\n* I am not currently considering doing a web version of this application.

You can download it at: Link\n\n\nThe purpose of this program is to allow the user to more easily manage a character's spell selection,\n\nwithout having to modify the \"playerlist.ifo\" file using gffeditor. I know there have been a few\n\ntimes when I have been using custom classes that can increase the caster-level of a spell-casting\n\nclass, but cannot increase the player's actual known spells (like Mystic Theurge). So I created \n\nthis program to remedy the problem, and I thought I would share it with the rest of the community.\n\n\n\n**** How to Use the NWN2 Spell Manager ****\n\n\n\n1) The program will automatically ask you to point to your Neverwinter Nights 2 installation directory.\n\nBy default, this will be \"C:\\Program Files\\Atari\\Neverwinter Nights 2\". Once you select this directory,\n\nthe program will begin loading all of the necessary files for the SPell Manager to run. It looks for\n\nthe \"spells.2da\" file and the \"dialog.tlk\" file. If there is a copy of \"spells.2da\" in the \"override\" folder\n\nin your \"My Documents\" NWN2 directory, the program will load that version instead. If there is a \"dialog.tlk\"\n\nfile in the \"My Documents\" NWN2 directory, the program will load that version of the file instead.\n\n\n\n2) Upon loading the necessary files, the Manager will now enter \"Viewer Mode,\" as indicated in\n\nthe program's title bar. This means that you can view all spells and their reference numbers\n\nby the class to which they belong. To view a spell list, click on \"View\" and high-light the\n\n\"Show Spell Lists\" sub-menu. Click on a specific class to make that class tab appear in the\n\nGUI. To hide a tab, click on \"View\" and high-light the \"Show Spell Lists\" sub-menu once more,\n\nand click on the class tab that has a check-mark next to it.\n\n\n\nWhen the program is in Viewer Mode, you will be unable to make any modifications to a\n\ncharacter's spell list. You must first load your character from a game save.\n\n\n\nTo view a level in the class spell list, click on one of the numbered buttons under the\n\n\"Spell Level\" area. A table should populate the space below, with three columns:\n\nSpell Reference Number, Spell Name and N/A. The \"N/A\" column will change later.\n\n\n\nThe \"View->Show Exception Spells List\" is to allow the player to view what invalid\n\nspells were taken off of the class spell lists, as those spells are usually part of some\n\nspecial circumstance. For example, the Spell Polymorph_Self_Mindflayer cannot be added\n\nto a character, and would not show up properly. The spell you actually want is plain ol'\n\nPolymorph Self, which does show up in the proper class lists.\n\n\n\nDouble click on any spell name in the \"Spell Name\" column to bring up its statistics.\n\nThis can be very helpful when selecting which spells you want!\n\n\n\n3) To load a character file, select \"File->Open Character File,\" which is now enabled since\n\nthe program has successfully loaded the game's spell list from the \"spells.2da\" file.\n\nAlternately, you can use the Alt+O keyboard short-cut. The program will now prompt you to\n\nselect the proper \"playerlist.ifo\" file from one of the folders in Neverwinter Nights 2's\n\nsave game directory. This should be located in your \"My Documents\" (Win XP) or \"Documents\"\n\n(Vista,Win 7) folder under the \"Neverwinter Nights 2->Saves\" folders.\n\n\n\nOnce you select the appropriate character, the program will attempt to load your character.\n\nIf there is an error loading the character file, the GUI should notify you.\n\n\n\n4) After the character has been successfully loaded, the GUI will shift to \"Editor Mode,\"\n\nas indicated in the program's title bar. Under the \"View->Show Spell Lists,\"some classes will\n\nbe disabled; this is because the program did not detect the character as possessing them when\n\nreading in the character file. If this is a bug, please submit it via the instructions at the\n\nend of this tutorial.\n\n\n\nThe class spell tab has changed now that the program is in editor mode: the last table of the\n\nspell table has shifted from \"N/A\" to \"Acquired.\" You can now click on the check-box in this\n\ncolumn; doing so adds the spell to your class list for the specified class. All spells the\n\ncharacter knows have already been check-marked.\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE that the game will calculate your caster level upon loading your save file. Thus,\n\nif you try to add a few 7th level spells to your Level 4 Sorcerer, the game will ignore those\n\nspells you added, because they are beyond how many the game is expecting to find. You can\n\nfreely add such spells to a Wizard's spell book, however, but you will be unable to cast them\n\nuntil you are the proper level.\n\n\n\n5) When you have selected the spells you desire, you can select \"File->Save\", keyboard\n\nshort-cut Ctrl+S, to save directly to the file you opened. Please be aware \n\nthat you should ALWAYS back up your file, just in case of a mishap. Alternatively, you \n\ncan select \"File->Save As\", keyboard short-cut Alt+S, to save to a different file.\n\n\n\nAfter the file is saved, you can close the program! Or, you can close the character file\n\nby selecting \"File->Close Character File\", keyboard short-cut Ctrl+C, to stop editing that\n\nfile. The program will change from \"Editor Mode\" to \"Viewer Mode\" once again, as indicated\n\nin the program's title bar.

The program will now ask you to point to your NWN2 installation directory when you start it up. It will automatically try to find and load the necessary files for the program to run. If there are different versions of the files needed (dialog.tlk, spells.2da) in the \"My Documents\" NWN2 folder, those will be used instead.\n\n2.) Double-clicking on the spell name in the \"Spell Name\" column will now bring up the spell's statistics from the game. This can come in handy when deciding which spell to pick!\n\n****Version 1.2 Changelog****\n1.) Fixed a bug where, upon loading game resources, the program would only spot the spells.2da file in the Data/2DA.zip file, and not in the expansion zip files if they were installed (2DA_X1.zip and 2DA_X2.zip).\n\n2.) Fixed a bug with the spell descriptions where the spacing was incorrect on a few descriptions.\n\n3.) Added a current file label that will show the user which save file they are working on.\n\n4.) The program no longer automatically prompts the user for the NWN2 install directory.\n\n****Version 1.2.1 Changelog****\n1.) Sped up the progress at which the game resources are loaded.","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"85":{"Name":"NWN2Library (Java)","Author":"Sheild","Submitted":20100223,"Updated":20100223,"Category":"Dialogue","Patch":"1.00","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is library witten in Java, that can be used to read data from the Neverwinter Nights 2 game resources.

I named it first VaultKeeper and started by rewriting all of LetoScript in CSharp until I got bored and gave up.\n\nRecently I went back to it and decided to make something simpler and focus on a few tasks.\n\nI tell you this because you need to understand that this is a personal project that I make available to you. Hence don't expect much support from me though if you report problems they will get my attention. But if you expect me to add features, I might or might not be interested. \n\nOn another hand feel free to take the source code and fork this application so it tailors your needs.\n\nAlso note that most of Charpenter features (if not all) are provided by NWNX4. So if you look for an alternative you could consider installing NWNX4 instead.\n\nFEATURES\nThose are currently available:\n\nAdd/Remove Tail and Wings to a character\nMake a character nude\nDelete a character\n\nThere are many other possibilities, but until I get more confident in the stability, I will stick to these.\n\nMETHOD\nCharpenter uses the Campaign Database for communication. I'm wondering if I should have used the logfile instead, however it will stay that way for now.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nCharpenter comes with an executable compiled in csharp. You need to install it along with OEISHared.dll\nSo, either create a folder for it and copy your OEIShared.dll into it, or copy Charpenter to your NWN2 server installation directory, whichever method you like best.\n\nCharpenter must run on the server machine. Though it might be able to work on a network but I never tested that.\n\nOnce charpenter is installed you need to locate your servervault and database folders.\nYou also need to specify the prefix for the database files. The default prefix is chp_ and you should leave it that way unless you have good reason to do so (ie. if your own databases share the same prefix).\n\nWhen you are ready click \"Start\" and Charpenter will start looking for the changes to the databases prefixed with \"chp_\" (or whatever else you specified).\n\n\nNow it's time to make your module Charpenter aware. Import the Charpenter.erf file to your module and you will get the scripts prefixed chp_ and a conversation that is provided as an example for you to modify.\nYou will need also to modify your module client_leave script. If you dont have one then you can use the chp_client_leave script provided.\n\nYou can use the example scripts or make your own, the example scripts are used by chp_leverconvo.\n\nThere is an example module provided. You will see two levers in the module. One uses chp_leverconvo, the second is used to reset the databases. You will need to do that at least once.\n\nIf you have changed the prefix in the application you will need to change it accordingly in the scripts, the relevant file is chp_inc_charpenter. Don't forget to Compile All files after.\n\nOPERATION:\n\nThe module is meant to be started through a server, not with the client.\n\nThe first time you enter the module you will need to prepare the database by using the \"Make ready\" lever. Then you can use the conversation and start making changes to your characters.\n\nAt the end of the conversation the character will be booted and the changes applied to the bic file.\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING:\n\nShould you have any problem getting the conversation starting, you need to delete all the databases prefixed chp_ and use the \"Make ready\" lever again.\n\nREMEMBER\n\nMAKE BACKUPS OF YOUR SERVERVAULT AND DATABASE FOLDERS BEFORE TESTING THIS!\n\nENJOY!\n","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"91":{"Name":"Servervault Statistics","Author":"FoamBats4All","Submitted":20101006,"Updated":20110221,"Category":"Player Characters","Patch":"1.23","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Built from Skywing's Datafile Accessor Library ( Link ), this utility will scan every .bic file in the servervault, check it against data loaded from NWN2 and a provided module's 2DA files, and provide statistics.\n\nStatistics are provided for gender, race, subrace, background, alignment, deity, levels, skill ranks, feats, tails, and wings.\n\nAdditionally, top lists (top 10 by default, configurable in the ini file) are provided for maximum health, armor class, base attack bonus, strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma, all skills, fort saves, reflex saves, willpower saves, experience, wealth, age (oldest and youngest), inventory size, and file size.\n\nThe ini file lets you enable/disable any of these reports by setting the field to 1 or 0.

This will make copies of the files in the UPDATED_FILES directory.\n\nYou can look at the output.txt file for information about the various things it changed and skipped. You should look for anything that says ADD to target 2da as that means you did not have the model in there.\n\nAttach the new 2da to your development module. then restart your toolset to pick up the changes.
