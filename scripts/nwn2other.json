It contains the Obsidian documentation for the Pre-Release Toolset as well as tutorials and tips developed by the Community. I converted their documents into on-line help. Please read the 'Welcome' topic in the Tome for information about how the documents in the Tome differ from the originals. I did not write any of the toolset-related content and I provided full credit to the original authors. Where possible, I also included links to the original document files so you can easily vote for them and leave comments for the authors.\n\nWhile the Tome of Building is an on-line help file, I did not have time to add hyperlinks to every cross referenece. This first edition of the ToB does contain some hyperlinks within the text, but mostly it is a convenient compilation of existing documentation. It is also easily navigable, thanks to the hyperlinked table of contents and powerful search feature.\n\nThe Tome is divided into two main sections, Obsidian Documentation and Community Documentation. There is also a Welcome section that introduces you to the Tome and explains how the Tome differs from the individual documents and how to navigate through the help file. \n\nRecently, several new tutorials have appeared on the Vault. I decided to release this version of the Tome so people would have what it contains now, if they wanted it, and I will update the Tome with the new tutorials for the \"Second Edition\".\n\nThere are two versions of the Tome and are provided in separate downloads:\n\n * Microsoft HTML Help file\n ------------------------\n This is a single help file, similar to what you would find with a \n typical Windows application.

Version 1.2\n\nRead the Readme for full list of changes.\n\nBasic concept:\n--------------\n1)A deity listing with all of the Forgotten Realms gods, and the option for other pantheons to be added. 2)Canon domain restrictions on deities. 3)Enough custom domains to give the right \"flavour\" to each deity. \n4)Custom domains that contain no scripting so that they can be used on any server or module as they are entirely client based. Check with a DM before using custom domains on their server/campaign out of courtesy. \n\nChange Made from v.1.1 to v1.2\n-----------------\n* Currently using official 1.03 dialog.tlk. The altered lines are: 6277, 6292, 6298, 182355-182458, 184800-184917\n* Restructured the nwn2_deities.2da to make switching between Forgotten Realms setting deities and Core Ruleset/Greyhawk deities easier. \n* Added extra dialog.tlk entries to distinguish between Forgotten Realms versions of deities and their Core Ruleset counterparts.\n* Added Hatred and Tyranny domains\n* Added Archdevils and Demon Princes\n\n\nInstructions\n------------------\nUnedited tlk file version:\n*Download nontlkversion.zip, unzip the contents. \n*Place the \"icons\" folder into \"...\\my documents\\neverwinter nights 2\\ui\\default\\images\\\"\n*Place domains.2da and nwn2_deities.2da in your \"...\\my documents\\neverwinter nights 2\\override\" folder.\n\nEdited tlk file version:\n*Download tlkversion.zip, unzip the contents. \n*Carry out the second and third instructions as above, plus: \n*Place the dialog.tlk file into your \"...\\my documents\\neverwinter nights 2\\\" base directory. \n\nTo enable/remove gods:\nThe original ruleset pantheon is disabled by default. To add/remove deities from the in-game listing, simply open up the nwn2_deities.2da and alter the single digit number that directly follows the deity name (third column). A zero indicates the deity will appear in game, a 1 indicates it will NOT appear in game. Save it having made your changes and re-load NWN2. \n\nKnown Issues:\n---------------\n1) It appears that the nwn2_deities.2da domainID columns are not functioning as expected so the restrictions for domains based on deity selection are not officially in place yet. Using the altered .tlk version will at least show you the canon domains in the description when you choose the deity however. \n2) Domains have not been created with PvP environments in mind so may be a little imbalanced in that respect. Suggestions for better balancing are welcomed. \n\nCredits\n-------\n- thanks to Soul Filcher for uploading the missing deity icons.\n\n- thanks to Sleaker for uploading the dragon and original ruleset deity icons with his own deity selection\n--------------\n","Rating":9.57,"Votes":13,"Awards":[]},"24":{"Name":"Neverwinter Nights Podcast","Author":"NWN Podcast","Submitted":20061108,"Updated":20061109,"Category":"Other","Forum Thread":"Link","Format":"HTML","Description":"Finally!

Um NWN2 komplett in Deutsch mit korrekter Mann/Frau Zuordnung zu spielen, ist dieser Patch aktuell von Version 1.0 - V1.10 (MoTB) > unbedingt nötig. \n\nBisher war es nötig nach der Soundpatchinstallation ab Version 1.03 die fehlerhafte Obsidian Datei: \n�%nwn2installdir%/Data/sounds_v103.zip� zu löschen. \nDies ist seit dieser Version des Soundpatches NICHT mehr nötig. \n\nPatch entpacken in:\n\"Eigene Dateien\\Neverwinter Nights 2\\Override\\SoundSets\"\n\nZu kompletten Deinstallation einfach den Ordner \"SoundSets\" löschen.\n\nViel Spaß mit dem Soundpatch. \nÜber ein Vote würde ich mich freuen\n\n#######################\nCredit an �Schatten� für die spellchants\n\nVersion 1.0 vom 18.11.2006\nAlles funktionierte einwandfrei, es war nur nötig ab Version 1.03 die Datei �sounds_v103.zip� zu Löschen.\n\nVersion 1.1 vom 12.10.2007\n20 spellchants von �Schatten� hinzugefügt.

Here are the Patch Notes.\n\nNathaniel Chapman - NWN2 Assistant Producer, Obsidian Entertainment - English Patch v1.03 Beta Released \nHey Everyone,We've released a beta version for the v1.03 patch today. For instructions on how to apply it, please head over to our NWN2 beta patch website at: http://nwn2.obsidian.net/support/patch_beta.htmlAdditional mirrors for the patch can be found at:NWVaultNWN2 WarcryAdditionally, the beta patch currently has two limitations:1) This beta patch is currently only compatible with the English version of the game. Localized versions of the patch will be available soon.2) In order to install the v1.03 Beta Patch, you will need to make sure you are currently running v1.02 of NWN2.Also, as with all Beta software, this patch is a work in progress. It is highly recommended that you back up your \"My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\" folder before installing the Beta patch.We here at Obsidian greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide on this Beta Patch. We plan to have the final version of the patch (which will support all languages and will be acquired through the autoupdater) available soon.\n\n More: If you are recieving errors patching, please take the following steps:1) If you have added any plugins, new scripts, or other custom content to the game folder, please temporarily remove remove them before you update the game. Then reapply them once the game is done patching.2) If this does not work, please try applying the patch while running in Safe Mode.3) If this does not work, please try backing up your \"My Documents\\Neverwinter Nights 2\" directory, uninstalling the game, reinstalling it, updating to 1.02 through the updater, and then applying the Beta Patch.If you try all of these steps and the patch still does not work, please post in the Technical Support forum with the information it asks you for and we will attempt to diagnose the issue.\n\n More: is it nessicary to remove all hacks or mods before you update?It will not be necessary in all cases but modifications to certain files can cause problems with patching. Removing any modifications to the game files would be a good first thing to check if you are having problems patching.\n\n BETA PATCH HERE! \nIt is, in fact, real, and I just posted the announcement. Please post any feedback and/or issues you have with installing the patch or running the patch once you guys have it up and running.Thanks everyone!","Rating":7.5,"Votes":13,"Awards":[]},"40":{"Name":"ILLvatu'z Uber NWN2 v1.11","Author":"ILLvatu","Submitted":20061122,"Updated":20120424,"Category":"Other","Format":"Various","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Here is a Update to my last posting.\nThis is v1.11 ready.\n========================================\nI appologise for any clan BS comments that are posted here. They are not related to this work or version of NWN. It is completly with ill intent and unfounded.\n\nThx,][LLv@tu\n========================================\n\n\nUpdated Security scripts, Uber Regen and Hitpoint event scripts. I have included a Uber Dueling Host Override. The Toolset override allows you to add Uber Hitpoints props at several custom Values. As well, you can add Uber Regen. If you know the costvalue(cv) of a Damage, DamageType, or Resistance Prop, and this cv is within range of my 2das. It can be applied in toolset and be seen upon examine in Any server! You Must use my dialog file to see these Custom Props in game, and in toolset.(dialog file goes in the Atari/NWN2 folder Not in the Documents/NWN2 folder!!)These Props wont be called badstrref anymore, they will have names so you know what they are!!\n\n After extensive in game testing, it has shown that Uber Regen and Hitpoints is far better applied via events rather then stacking Regen props or using onhitcast Regen props. 16383 Regen is far more Consistant and effective being applied as a ModEvent!This was tested on a 12 damage type Regen tester dealing 15310 dmg per hit in total!! Resolving any doubt that it is the best method of application with no lag! You can add Prop Hitpoints to your items in toolset as long as you know the cost value they(different servers) use, or you wish to use. Since its really not the best way, and I dont promote anything but what i feel is best. I am not providing a \"Prop\" Host Override. Toolset will still allow you to add custom uber props, so you can enter different servers with different needs. Hosting, and using regen and hitpoint props is not recommended.\n\nFor the moment Uber Regen is applicable in my toolset 2das. I, without any doubt, know that Prop added Regen is NOT as good as Event Applied Regen. I have tested Prop Regen vs. Event applied Regen with a 12 damagetype regen tester. Prop Regen Failed 2 full levels below Event applied Regen! Test for yourself! Just make a regen item and turn off event Regen and Regen Prop Removal in the scripts and compare the difference yourself!\n\nAs a host using the event scripts, you choose the amount, and when, Uber Hitpoints and Regen is applied. You or any patrons will get Uber Hitpoints and Regen With ZERO Props and ZERO Lag. \n\nAs for the NWN2 Stacking BUG(ActiveAlways items) I included in the security script some removal and restrictions that will keep all on the same level playing/dueling field! This prop cant be effected. For now, there is no script commands to access it. I have set damage to counter the stacked effect, and can remove any Props with unwanted costvalues.\n\n As the new game is more graphic intensive, this is a nice feature to use/merge in your mod/area event slots, to help with lag issues. Using this scripted method, only a Damage 2da is needed! You can run the Regen and Hitpoints event scripts with any 2das, as long as the damagecost 2da has the correct dieroll damage amounts! \n\nEveryone will be at 15320HP with these scripts in use! The problem using Props for Hitpoint bonus is having to run at the game max 32767 hitpoints. Since every Player can have a large difference in hitpoints to start, the amount of hitpoints you end up with still has the large difference. So if props are used, it has to be at the highest value possible giving everyone the same 32767hp total. More trouble comes from the fact that any hit of 16383 dmg will kill anyone, even if they have twice the hitpoints. This means the first to get hit dies! This sucks for Dueling! \n \nWith these 2das and dialog together, you get complete freedom to do as you wish. Even when you dont use custom props in your server, you can add these props for other servers. \n\nIf you split up or overwrite these 2das i cannot say they will function fully correct.To make it easier I provide resricted uber dueling override.The Overrides I provide need all within to function 100%!!! \n\nTo see any custom content names anywhere, you must use my dialog file and the correct Override! \nTo apply any custom content in toolset you must use my dialog file and correct Override. \nThe dialog file will NOT effect any of the original games dialog! The only exception is BadStringReference will show if they are out of range of my 2das. If you see a named custom costvalue in game(i.e. \"cv59\"), you can apply them to items in toolset, as long as you use my dialog and the correct Override. \n\nThe Dialog file will need to be updated with any NWN2 updates!!! DO NOT OVERWRITE the ORIGINAL DIALOG file!! SAVE the ORIGINAL Dialog!! It WILL be NEEDED for any UPDATES!!\nWhen you update the game, Replace my Dialog with the original Dialog you saved, before updating. Then look for my next Update to post, and swap them out again. Ill post any other changes to anything at this time as well!\n \nI made this as versitile as I could atm. All Overrides have common 2das,\nbut could have different content, so make sure you dont overwrite or mix \nthem ect.. If your intent is to alter the overrides, I would suggest you \ncreate a seperate folder for this mixing editing of 2das!! When you wish\nto use the overrides you COPY-PASTE the content into your override! Never \nEver Use the Originals!!\n \nNow You will be able to make all your own custom stuff in toolset for most \nany server, and provide a constant dueling atmosphere in your server with \nless prop lag!\n \nThis entire NOProp system can be set to any amounts desired. This can be done on your own, if you have some scripting and 2da skills. Just back it all up First!\n \nThis Package includes scripts, 2das, a testing module w/ testing placables \nand a \"All-in-One\" Server Bot!\n \nP.S. Toolset Overrides are named TOOLSET because thats all they are to be used for!! The same goes for the HOST and PLAYING Overrides!! If you want Spells when HOSTing or in Single Player, just remove the Spells 2da AFTER you have copy/pasted the Host 2das into the your Override!!! \n\nThe difference between the 2 Toolset Overrides is: \nThe \"Full Range Values\" is for making custom Items in Toolset with \"new\"\nvalues you have found or wish to use. The \"Known Values\" is for faster \nselecting of known prop values to be added to Items. \n\nCheers my Uber Friends! Uber is alive and kicking Arse in NWN2! \n\nEnjoy, ][LLvatu","Rating":9.57,"Votes":25,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"41":{"Name":"Complete Lootable Items Lists","Author":"McGavin","Submitted":20061124,"Updated":20061127,"Category":"Document","Format":"Other","Description":"Complete List of Armors, Weapons and Miscelaneous Items that are lootables including unique and special edition weapons (NWN2 Campaign Plot Only Weapons are not included).\n\nData includes Names, Tags, ResRef, Item Type, and Gold Peice Values.\n\nThese files are in OpenOffice Spreadsheet Document (www.openoffice.org)\n\n*Added Armors and Miseleaneous files\n\n*Update: Added MS Excel formated files.","Rating":9.55,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"42":{"Name":"MS Word Formatted NWN2 Recipes","Author":"Dragonhawke","Submitted":20061126,"Updated":20061129,"Category":"Reference Guides","Format":"Word Doc","Description":"A MSWord format of Immortalpod recipes files.\nYou'll need Kelt and Celtic Knots fonts to view the formatting I used.","Rating":9.13,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"43":{"Name":"Expanded Deities","Author":"Sleaker","Submitted":20061128,"Updated":20061205,"Category":"2DA Files","Forum Thread":"Link","Format":"2da","Description":"Expanded Deities adds 165 entries from Various Sourcebooks.\n\nNew in Release Version 0.3\n *Deites & Churches from Faiths of Eberron\n *Dead Deities from Lost Empires of Faerun\n *Fixed Balder's icon, should display now.\n\nCurrently this is just a rudimentary proof of concept, I intend to flesh out all the added God with proper tlk information when Obsidian releases patch 3.\nThese are client based, as it is overrides, and as Obsidian has shown ingame that Deities will not limit your ability to play the game, they are for flavour.","Rating":9.44,"Votes":4,"Awards":[]},"44":{"Name":"Replacement Cleric Domains","Author":"Chaosprism","Submitted":20061129,"Updated":20061206,"Category":"2DA Files","Forum Thread":"Link","Format":"2da","Description":" V1.1\n\n\n\nThis is an override of the NWN2 standard domains, mostly adding flavour to the domains and spells especially for level 1-3 clerics.\nAlso removed fireball from fire sphere.

This makes the property free to buy and worthless to sell on dynamically generated items. I don't know what it should be, but I have set it to 0.05 for now.\n\nSpecific Spell Immunity - iprp_spellcost.2da\nWhen the Specific Spell Immunity property is added to and item, some of the spells listed in iprp_spellcost.2da have a StrRef (in the Name column), that ends with a number in brackets, such as Warcry (7). So in the right click examine you get \"Spell Immunity: Warcry (7)\". This would seam to mean immunity to the warcry spell only if cast at level7. This is nonsense, it should just be \"Spell Immunity: Warcry\".\n\nTo fix the specific spell immunity problem, I have found what I think are the right string references and modified my iprp_spellcost.2da. The changes are:\n\n * 171 Magic_Circle_against_Alignment: Name (5135) should be 5115 \n * 182 Aura_of_Vitality: Name (6362) should be 6338 \n * 183 War_Cry: Name (6363) should be 6339 \n * 184 Regenerate: Name (6364) should be 6340 \n * 185 Evards_Black_Tentacles: Name (6365) should be 6341 \n * 186 Legend_Lore: Name (6367) should be 6342 \n * 187 Find_Traps: Name (6368) should be 6343 \n * 223 Great_Thunderclap: Label should be DEL_Great_Thunderclap\n\nCast Spell - iprp_spells.2da\nWhen the Cast Spell property is added to an item, many of the new (nwn2) spells do not display their effective caster level. Although iprp_spells lists the effective caster level, when added to an item the effective caster level is not visible in the right-click-examine window. Following the StrRefs to the .tlk table shows that the effective caster level has not been included. When one cast spell property can be added to an item and different levels (eg Weapon Impact), the same StrRef is listed for each in the .2da.\n\nUnfortunately the correct StrRef does not seem to be in the .tlk at all, so I cannot fix the .2da. For now my workaround is to look up the effective caster level in iprp_spells.2da and construct the string to be displayed. This will look fine in my GUI but the right-click-examine will still not show the effective caster level.\n\n","Rating":8.75,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"86":{"Name":"The Grinning Fool's String Decryptor","Author":"Grinning Fool","Submitted":20070202,"Updated":20070829,"Category":"Other","Forum Thread":"Link","Format":"Various","Description":"Note: This now works with Reflector 5.x\n\nIf you develop plugins, you're familiar with the \"encrypted\" strings that Reflector shows you when walking through decompiled toolset code. \n\nWhenever you copy a string to the clipboard, this little tool snatches it up and attempts to convert it to a decrypted string.

Server Administrators can specify two URLs in this menu: One, intended to point to their server�s homepage, if it has one, and one intended to directly point to the server�s latest PWC file. Players will be able to see these links from the Server Details on the Internet Game browser and clicking them will launch the user�s Browser and direct them to the URL specified.\n�Many of the skyrings (the geometry that exists at the horizon of the game world) have been revised to make them more visually appealing.\n�There is now a 4th parameter to the DisplayGuiScreen() script function that allows a user to define the name fo the *.xml file to load if the 'ScreenName' can't be found inside the INIs already. This will allow custom GUI creators to add GUIs (Using the ui\\custom\\ folder) and not need to edit the INIs stored in ui\\default to make the game able to load them.\n�Augment Summoning and Augment Healing are now selectable once their prerequisites have been met.\nScripting\n�A bDisplayFeedback=TRUE parameter was added to both ActionGiveItem and ActionTakeItem. Changing it from the default of TRUE to FALSE will keep the feedback strings from appearing in the chat window when these script functions are used.\n�2DAs queried by script functions are now cached. This should increase performance of scripts that frequently reference 2Das.\n�Within the Script Editor, hitting the Tab key now creates 5 spaces instead of inserting a tab character.\nToolset\n�Within the appearance.2da, NWN2_Scale has now been split into three columns: NWN2_Scale_X, NWN2_Scale_Y and NWN2_Scale_Z. This will allow users to scale creature appearances non-uniformally through the appearance.2da.\n�The Grass, Creature Appearance Type, and Creature Soundset lists are now sorted alphabetically.\n�Walkmesh Helpers have been added to Placeables/Misc Props. These objects are invisible square objects that can be resized and placed on a map to bake a walkmesh. You can use them to make flat objects walkable that normally are not or would be difficult to bake. Some examples of situations where these would be useful are a long length of repeating bridge pieces or building roofs. To view the Walkmesh Helpers in the Toolset, turn on the display of C2 Collision volumes. There are two versions; each will play a different footstep sound. Special thanks to Zarathustra217 for the original concept and objects.\n\nBug Fixes\nGeneral\n�The Quick Cast menu was blocking movement clicks for its entire area � even parts that were not visible. Players can now click through any non-visible part of the Quick Cast menu.\n�Feats will now properly show their cool down timer countdown.\nDM Client\n�The DM Chat toggle could previously not be turned back on after it was turned off. This has been fixed.\nEffects/Spells\n�Certain multiclass characters could lose spells from their hotbar after making area transitions. This will no longer occur.\n�The Reflex save for Defensive Roll can now happen multiple times per day.\n�Manyshot was previously always applying the full attack bonus and penalty to hit, regardless of the character�s BAB. This has been fixed.\n�Female Drow Clerics would be previously be forced to pick a new deity at level up if they had selected Lolth during character creation. This has been fixed.\n�\nToolset\n�Several words that previously were incorrectly being highlighted by the syntax highlighter will no longer be highlighted.\n�The GetIsPartyTransition() flag for triggers always returned true, regardless of what was set in the toolset. This has been fixed.\n2DA Changes\nThe following 2DA files have been changed in v1.05:\n�appearance.2da\n�classes.2da\n�cls_atk_1.2da\n�cls_atk_2.2da\n�cls_atk_3.2da\n�cls_bsplvl_arctr.2da\n�cls_bsplvl_eknight.2da\n�cls_bsplvl_harper.2da\n�cls_bsplvl_palema.2da\n�cls_bsplvl_wprst.2da\n�cls_savthr_barb.2da\n�cls_savthr_bard.2da\n�cls_savthr_cler.2da\n�cls_savthr_cons.2da\n�cls_savthr_dru.2da\n�cls_savthr_fight.2da\n�cls_savthr_monk.2da\n�cls_savthr_pal.2da\n�cls_savthr_rang.2da\n�cls_savthr_rog.2da\n�cls_savthr_sorc.2da\n�cls_savthr_wild.2da\n�cls_savthr_wiz.2da\n�damagelevels.2da\n�feat.2da\n�hen_companion.2da\n�hen_familiar.2da\n�iprp_damagecost.2da\n�iprp_srcost.2da\n�keymap.2da\n�placeables.2da\n�racialtypes.2da\n�spells.2da\n\nIn addition, the following 2DA files have been added in v1.05:\n�cls_featmap_arctr.2da\n�cls_featmap_eknight.2da\n�cls_featmap_harper.2da\n�cls_featmap_palema.2da\n�cls_featmap_wprst.2da\n\n","Rating":8.58,"Votes":5,"Awards":[]},"97":{"Name":"Map of the Arlordian Empire","Author":"Roy Wang","Submitted":20070317,"Updated":20070317,"Category":"World Maps","Format":"Other","Description":"Setting to my Apocrypha Campaign.","Rating":7.75,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"98":{"Name":"Prestige Class Wizard, v1.0.1.2, Beta","Author":"Ville Alasaari","Submitted":20070318,"Updated":20070614,"Category":"Application","Forum Thread":"Link","Format":"Various","Description":"A Prestige Class Wizard for Neverwinter Nights® 2.\nCreates required 2da files (classes.2da and cls_pres_*.2da) for your new prestige class.\n\nTested with 1.0.5.912, 1.0.6.973.\n\nThis is beta, so there will be bugs and such...\n\n[1.0.1.2]\n= Added more sanity checks.\n+ Added \"How to: Create Custom Class Feat Table\" - Word document.\n\n[1.0.1.1]\n+ v1.0.5.912 compatible.\n+ Since the classes.2da file has changed, needed to add new field: \"Bonus Caster Feat Class Map\".\n\n[1.0.0.2]\n+Tutorial document added.\n+Some minor fixes.\n\n[1.0.0.1]\n+Document added (working in progress).\n\n+Added two programs from the PRC Editor:\n* Skills_NWN2.exe: Creates the class skill 2da file.

The warmage is a specialized spellcater that has a limited spell selection to choose from. The warmage is much like a sorcerer in that you are a spontaneus caster and do not learn new spells from scrolls. However unlike the warmages sorcerer and wizard counterparts the warmage is able to wear armor while casting spells.\n\n\nSpecial Notes:\n\n You must use the recommend button when leveling up and choosing your spells or you must manually scroll to the bottom of the spell list and hand add all spells beginning with \"Warmage\". This is currently a limitation of the character generation and level up screens.\n\n Also when getting bonus feats and regular feats you will see the spellcastng feats for leveling up in a prestige class. This is also a glitch within the game as these feats have to appear there in order for you to properly have spells granted on levelup within the game. I'm looking for a fix for this as well.\n\nInstallation:\n\n This mod contains a sub folder and a dialog.tlk file.

Arcane Archer, Arcane Trickster, Arcane Scholar of Candelkeep, Dragon Disciple, Harper Agent, & Palemaster. The Warmage is not a specialist Wizard despite having a spellschool and does not qualify for the Red Wizards of Thay.\n\n1.00 BETA: The Warmage Core Base class only with the 5 reserve casting feats from the original project.

The engine is limited and only looks for the first class if it needs new spells. This means that a Mystic Theurge will not get to pick new spells on MT levels, because the engine only looks to the cleric/druid to see if new spells are needed and skips the wizard/sorc. This means that a sorcerer will have to pick a sorcerer level in between MT levelups or edit in the spells using a GFF editor or TLK edit. The game does give you spellcasting progression and it will remember the spells you should have, so as soon as you pick a sorcerer level, you will get to pick all the spells you missed. The bard doesn't have this problem, the bard comes becore the cleric/druid, so he's the one who gets to pick spells. The Ultimate Magus also suffers from this limitation, but since both bard and sorcerer come before the wizard, the wizard is the one who won't get to pick new spells, which isn't a problem since he can memorise scrolls anyway. The Eldritch Theurge also suffers from this. You can only pick warlock spells at warlock levelups.\n\n\nSmall deviations from PnP:\n\nMystic Theurge: I changed the arcane spell level requirement to level It makes the class more playable with sorcerers, since they have more sorcerer levels to pick in between MT levels.\nUltimate Magus: Spontanious arcane spellcasting has been set to level 4. Because of engine limitations, it's not possible to get seperate spellcasting progression for both classes, so it's either full progression for both or limited for both. I chose to give full spellcasting progression, but the spontanious requirement has been upped to level 2 so you can't achieve level 9 spells with either spellcasting class, which you also can't in PnP. The spell power and bonus feats have also been implemented, but Augmented Casting and Expanded Spell Knowledge were not possible to implement at this time.\nSwashbuckler: Acrobatic Charge has been replaced with the Dash feat, Acrobatic Mastery has been replaced with Skill Focus: Tumble. Improved flanking has been replaced with Opportunist and finally Lucky has been implemented as the halfling racial Lucky, so a passive +1 saves.\nEldritch Theurge: The Area of Effect spells with a Cone shape have been changed to Sphere AOE spells when used in the Spellblast feat (the spells themselves have not changed, unless specifically mentioned) because Cones cannot originate from a spot other then the caster. Also, the Spellblast and Greatreach Spellblast feats can only be enhanced with the base spells. When selecting a spell with metamagic, the metamagic will be neglected and the spellblast will use up a spell slot of the spell's base level. This is because the GetHasSpell script cannot identify metamagic and the DecrementRemainingUses script does not take metamagic into account.\n\nInstallation:\n\nOverride + Dialog.tlk version: The override folder contains the content you need to put in your override folder. The dialog.tlk goes in to the My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2 folder.\nOverride + Custom.tlk version: The override folder contains the content you need to put in your override folder. The custom.tlk goes in to the TLK folder and you need to put the custom file (the one without the .tlk) in the installation directory of NWN2 instead of the My Documents directory (in my case C:\\games\\neverwinter nights 2). Now use the toolset and add the custom.tlk to the module you wish to play the game with. You can set this in the module properties of the module.\nHak + Custom.tlk version: The hak goes into the my documents/neverwinter nights 2/hak directory, the custom.tlk in the TLK directory and the custom tile in the neverwinter nights 2 installation directory (C:\\...\\neverwinter nights 2.).

That word is Premonition.\nWe here at Obsidian have been working on Neverwinter\nNights 2 for just over three years now. The biggest milestone in our\nthree years working on Neverwinter Nights 2 was last October�s launch of\nthe game. It was great to get the product out to people, so they could\nsee the campaign we�d developed and check out what the new engine and toolset\nwere capable of.\nAs with any undertaking of the scope of NWN2, there\nhave been many challenges � but we�ve always dedicated ourselves to resolving\nthem, pressing ahead and looking forward to the potential of what we felt a\ngreat sequel to Neverwinter Nights should be. As exciting and\nrewarding as it was to release the game, and as proud as we are of it, we\ncertainly understood and in many cases agreed with some of the\ncomplaints. Even at launch, we wanted to improve the game in several\nways. And so we pressed ahead, always driven to achieve that potential �\ndriven by the vision of what both we and the community could make of Neverwinter\nNights 2. \nUpdate 1.03 saw massive performance improvements, and now\nUpdate 1.07 will include a second set of performance optimizations. We�ve\nworked with the community to improve some of the walkmesh and AI issues with\nthe game, and our dedication to supporting our scriptable, customizable\ngraphical user interface (GUI) has paid off with the community developing UI modifications\nthat allow people to customize the game�s UI to their liking. The DM\nclient you�re getting with this patch is a full featured tool for running\nmultiplayer games.\nAdditionally, we knew when we released the game that while\nthe Neverwinter Nights 2 toolset was much more flexible and powerful\nthan the original game�s, it would have a steeper learning curve. \nAdditionally, some of us were worried about whether the community would step up\nto the plate with the new functionality we�d given them. For instance, we\nknew the UI scripting we introduced was powerful � but would people take\nadvantage of it?\nI�m pleased to say that, while there certainly has been a\nbit of a learning curve while the community has been mastering the new engine,\nnew toolset and new functionality we�ve provided, looking back at the past year\nI can point to lots of fantastic things that the community has generated � many\nof which were impossible in the old game.\nFor examples, check out our NWN2\nBlog, where each week we highlight some of the cool things the community\nhas made.\nBut, here�s a short list of examples of cool community creations\nwithin the last year:\n� \nThe NWN2 DMFI, with its strong integration into the user\ninterface and its own custom GUI.\n� \nAll of the cool community generated stuff up on NWVault,\nincluding the custom Modules, prefab areas, custom GUIs, and much more.\n� \nThe extremely useful toolset plugins, which extend to the\ncommunity the ability to generate the tools that they want or need.\n� \nTonyK and evenflw�s AI improvements.\n� \nAll of the entrants into our Module contest.\n� \nSeveral very cool, active persistent worlds.\n\nAll this � and people haven�t even had the new toolset and engine for a full\nyear! \nAnd so, we�re going to continue looking forward. This\nOctober, Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer will ship, a\nlittle bit shy of NWN2�s first birthday. And, in anticipation of Mask,\nwe�re delivering the largest, most feature rich update to NWN2 yet.\nRemember when I mentioned Premonition earlier? \nA premonition is a sense of the future; an anticipation of what is to\ncome. In many ways, Mask was designed to anticipate the things\nthat you guys would like to see improved in Neverwinter 2 � better\nperformance and new creatures, area textures, placeables, races and classes and\nmore.\nWe here at Obsidian are very excited to get Mask to\nall of you. And, we�re excited to see what the community will do with the\nnew stuff we�ve provided. This update contains many of the core game\nchanges that we�ve made during the development of Mask of the Betrayer. \nIt even contains a sneak peak at one of Mask�s new creatures. We\nfelt that this update was big enough to warrant its own title � and so we\ndecided on Premonition, as this Update gives you, the community, a\nchance to anticipate some of what you all are going to see when you pick up Mask.\nPremonition is a fitting title for another reason,\ntoo. This update is a preview of our future plans to continue to improve\nthe level of support and dedication we�ve given to the game - to continue to\nlook forward and make Neverwinter Nights 2 the ultimate computer D&D\nrole-playing experience.\nFrom all of us here at Obsidian, we hope you enjoy Premonition\nand Mask of the Betrayer. And, as always, we�re looking forward to\nseeing the awesome and creative content you guys develop with the new tools\nwe�ve provided.\nThanks, \nNathaniel Chapman\nAssistant Producer\nObsidian Entertainment, Inc.\n\n \nNew Features in Premonition\n \nGeneral\n� \nCharacter\nMode and Strategy Mode � In advance of the release of the Mask of the Betrayer expansion\npack this September, we�ve included one of the major new revisions we�ve made\nto the camera and control modes.\nNow, the four camera modes (Top Down, Chase,\nDriving and Free Camera) have been consolidated into two modes that are more\nconfigurable and clearer to use than the old modes � Character Mode and\nStrategy Mode. \n\nThese modes affect both the function of the camera and the controls for each\nmode, and are designed to be most efficient for the two primary styles of play\n� controlling a single character, and controlling a full party. Note that while\nthe information given here refers to the default function of each mode, these\nmodes are highly configurable.\nPlease check out all of the options in the\nnewly updated Options Menu.\nYou can toggle which mode you are in by pressing\nthe * key by default.\no \nCharacter\nMode: In Character\nMode, the camera follows behind and over the shoulder of the currently\ncontrolled character. This mode is useful for getting a good look at your\nsurroundings and exploring an area while focused on controlling an individual\ncharacter.\nWhile in Character Mode, by default, holding the Left Mouse Button\ndown and moving the mouse to the left or right will turn the character. You can\nalso turn by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen. Holding down the\nMiddle Mouse Button or pressing the Arrow keys will allow you to rotate the\ncamera around the currently controlled character.\no \nStrategy\nMode: Strategy\nMode is a top down Play Mode that is intended to make controlling a full party\neasier. This mode is most useful for controlling combat situations involving a\nfull party of characters against a large number of enemies. In Strategy Mode,\nby default, you can click and drag to select multiple party members. You can\nrotate the camera either by holding the Middle Mouse Button and moving the\nmouse, by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen, or by pressing the\nArrow Keys.\n\n\n� \nNew Options\nMenu � Patch 1.07\nalso introduces a new options menu that gives you access to consolidated and\nclear options for each camera mode, and better organization of the already\nexisting options.\n� \nMarquee/Multi-Selection\nRevamp � Marquee\nand Multi-selection have been dramatically improved to make controlling a full\nparty much easier.\nYou can see the new improvements to Marquee and\nMulti-selection in the new Strategy Mode.\n� \nUI\nImprovements\no \nParty AI\nOn/Off Button �\nThere is now a button on the main game UI, next to the rest button, that will\ntoggle the entire party�s AI on or off.\no \nPlayer Chat\nList � A list of\nall players on the server is now available on the Player Menu (the NWN2 �Eye�\nbutton in the lower left corner of the screen).\nYou can select any player from\nthis list to send them a tell.\no \n\"Handles\"\nhave been added to the chat windows to allow them to be moved more easily.\no \nA logcommands\nconsole command has been added that allows you to dump all of the console\ncommands to a text file.\no \nConsole commands\nare no longer case sensitive.\n� \nGameplay\nImprovements\no \nDarkvision and\nLow-light Vision are now modes that can be toggled on or off using the Mode\nBar.\nThey also have new visual effects to accompany this change.\n� \nBronze\nDragon - New Creature!\nThe Bronze Dragon\ncreature has been added to the Toolset, so expect him to show up in new community\ncontent as well as Mask of the Betrayer.\n� \nStealth\nImprovements � Some\nimprovements have been made to stealth to make it more effective in a\nMultiplayer environment.\nAmong these, characters who are hidden will no longer\nshow up when detected by any party member, and hidden characters should be\nhidden properly regardless of faction.\n \nToolset\n� \nA \"Find a\nResource\" Plugin has been added to the toolset.\n� \nA Creature\nAppearance Wizard has been added.\nThis will allow you to change the appearance\nof spawned creatures and creature blueprints, including race, gender, armor and\narmor attachments.\nThis feature can be accessed by right clicking on a\ncreature or blueprint entry.\nNOTE:\nThis feature is currently in Beta, and\nthere are plans to improve its functionality.\n� \nA Texture\nSwapper has been added that allows builders to swap the textures in a tileset.\nThis feature can be accessed from a tile�s properties pane, visible by right\nclicking on a tile.\n� \nA new custom skydome\nsystem has been added to the toolset, allowing users to replace the NWN2 skies\nwith skydomes of their own creating. \n� \nAreas now have\nadditional settings under their Day/Night Stage Properties that allow builders\nto �de-saturate� an area � that is, remove a percentage of the color from an\narea, all the way to black and white.\n \nDM Client\n� \nA UI feature\nhas been added to allow DMs to adjust player/creature alignments using a slider\nbar.\n� \nComments from\nthe toolset (comments within the {} brackets) will now show up in the Creator.\n� \nThe distance a\nDM can zoom out has been greatly increased.\n� \nA filter\nfeature has been added to the DM Client player list.\nThis will allow DMs to\nselect specific players and filter their list down to only show those selected\nplayers.\n \n \nBug Fixes in\nPremonition\n \nGeneral\n� \nThe PC model\nduring level up should be scaled to match the scaling in game\n� \nModule Debug text\nshould now display properly.\n� \nThe Dwarven\nDefender Defensive Stance ability now functions properly.\n� \nThe game will no\nlonger crash if a player presses the + key on the number pad in a multiplayer\ngame.\n� \nFixed an issue\nthat was resulting in corrupted save games.\n� \nTyping // will\nnow make it so that the rest of the string is not treated as a command input,\nallowing the character to speak the rest of the string without any changes.\n� \nCharacter AI\nshould now respond to all attacks, not just attacks that result in damage.\n� \nFixed an\nexploit that allowed players to increase their CON.\n� \nNeutral\nplayers should now be able to select Akadi as a deity.\n� \nThe Improved\nDefense feats should now replace each other.\n� \nMouse camera\npanning and tilting are now options in the game.\n \nToolset\n� \nThe 2DA editor\nin toolset should now handle rows where the row # is 4 digits.\n� \nWhen viewing a\n2DA in the toolset, sorting by any column other than the # will no longer\nrenumber all the entries when saving.\n� \nChanging a\nplaceable's OpenState property will no longer yield an Unknown.\n� \nSwapping\ntextures in the toolset should no longer result in solid black textures.\n� \nOpening the\ntoolset after having set the TreeLeaves option to false in the View ->\nOptions -> Graphics menu should result in leaves not being rendered.\n� \nBuilders can now\nselect male or female model previews on the Armor Tab in the creature\nproperties window.\n� \nManually\nentering a value in the Pressure's text field should now affect brushes.\n� \nWhen you run\nthe toolset a prefabs folder should be created, which becomes the default\nlocation for saving Prefab objects.

It automatically recasts your buffs when you're not in combat. The little Warlock Buddy GUI consists of 5 toggle buttons.\n\n* General buff toggle: This automatically (and instantly) casts all your long lasting buffs. Should for whatever reason your buffs expire (because you rested or perhaps because you died), then it'll recast the buffs automatically.\n* Invisibility toggle: This automatically buffs your Walk Unseen for you when out of combat. When you get Retributive Invisbility, both spells will be cast. Retributive Invisibility only has a 3 round duration, so if you're out of luck, it expires right when you walk in to combat. Fortunately, Walk unseen will also still be cast, so even if the improved invisibility fades, so still remain unseen. If you want to be sure that you keep your improved invisibility, it's still possible to cast the spell manually from the quickcast, ensuring you have a 3 round duration. If you want to hide in combat, you'll also have to cast the invisibility spells manually.\n* Flee the Scene toggle: This will continually recast Flee the Scene for you when not in combat. You and your party will travel hasted without you having to do anything for it besides toggling on this button.\n* Dark Foresight toggle: This will recast Dark Foresight for you when out of combat. You'll get a fresh new layer of 150 points damage reduction without having to go to the trouble of recasting the buff yourself. Just like with the other buffs, when you want a recast IN combat, you'll have to do it yourself, since automatic and instant recasting during combat would be cheating ;)\n* Hideous Blow toggle: The skill that started it all. This toggle button will instantly cast Hideous Blow for you and it will keep recasting it for you every round. When this skill is toggled on, it will also display a list of all essences to choose from. This makes it possible to change your Hideous Blow essence mid combat.\n\nAnd the good thing, it has it's own scripts, so it won't mess with any other spell changes you may have. The only file that could possibly allready be used is a custom quickcast GUI. (quickspell.xml).\n\nInstallation:\n\n- Put all the files in the override\n- Go to your installation directory and go to UI\\default (C:\\neverwinter nights 2\\UI\\default). Look for a file called ingamegui.ini or ingameguix1.ini and add the below line at the bottom of the first list called [MandatoryGUI]. I added it to both files to be sure (x1 is probably the game used when MOTB is installed, but I wanted to be sure).\n\nSCREEN_WARLOCK=warlock.xml\n\nShould you allready have a custom Quickspell.xml, then open my quickspell.xml and look for the button called WarlockToggle, should be below the spontanious conversion toggle. Be sure to copy the entire button entry (about 10 lines) and paste it into your other quickcast GUI.\n\nFor those wondering how to get the Warlock GUI to appear: There's a toggle for the warlock GUI below where the spontanious metamagic toggle is, right next to the metamagic pane of the quickcast menu. That's it. As easy as that :)\n\n- Draco Rayne\n","Rating":9.9,"Votes":26,"Awards":["Hall of Fame"]},"137":{"Name":"MOTB level adjustment remover","Author":"lukev001","Submitted":20071007,"Updated":20080316,"Category":"2DA Files","Format":"2da","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is the 2da file that removes the ecl of all races, the hagspawn and half celestial to.

It takes a step away from the PnP ability modifiers and favoured classes, and seek to tie it more closely to how the genasi is generally percieved and described. Instead of simply removing the ECL +1 from the genasi, I have given them new favoured classes, new ability modifiers for Fire Genasi and Air Genasi, as well as giving all the Genasi their corresponding Cleric domain for free, with whatever associated bonus feat (regardless of class).\n\nAll genasi now also recieve a bonus \"low level\" feat (Basic General Feat, Level 1 Background Feat or Basic Skill Feat)\n\nI have also changed the in-game texts to mirror the changes made on all abilities, feats and domains that warrented it, aswell as race texts.\n\nInstallation:\n1) Open with WinRAR.\n2) Extract the dialog.tlk to the \"Neverwinter Nights 2\"-folder in \"My Documents\".\n2) Extract all .2da-files to the Override Folder inside the \"Neverwinter Nights 2\"-folder in \"My Documents\".\n3) ???\n4) Profit.\n\nKnown Issues/Notes:\nOnly issue I have detected is that if you are a Genasi, and you level up as a Cleric, you are still able to choose whatever Domain you already have (Ex: A Fire Genasi Cleric, that get the Fire Domain for free, can still choose the fire domain upon gaining it's first level of Cleric. This does not result in duplicate domains).\n\nA genasi cleric can have 3 domains. Whatever two domains it gets from being a Cleric, plus the 1 from simply being a Genasi. This works as intended. All abilities, extra feats and additional spells function properly. This means that all genasi are slightly better clerics than most other races. From v1.1 and onward, no genasi has cleric as a favoured class.\n\nI would have liked to add Searing Light or Burning Hands as a spell-like ability for the Fire Genasi, but it's not really necessary and at present I have no idea how to do it properly. If anyone know how to make spell-like abilities from spells and add them as racial feats, I'd love the help.\n\nChanges in this version includes an additional minor feat for every genasi, changes to the Fire genasi ability scores (From +2 Intelligence, +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma to +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution), a change in Air genasi favoured class (from Cleric to Bard), as well as a rewriting of the genasi race descriptions to add more 'fluff'. Fire Genasi keeps Sorcerer as favoured class.\n\nMy thanks goes out to members of the Neverwinter Nights 2 (MotB) forums that helped me through the creative process in the thread that sparked this idea on my part. Most notable of these are JaegerBane, Countless, G_u_s, jdeneweth & Elphilm. It was they that convinced me regarding the sorcerer-issues in the last version, and jdeneweth pushed the pebble of my mind that was the Air genasi Bard. I hope you all enjoy this version better.\n\n//Varenus von Luckmann II","Rating":9.4,"Votes":7,"Awards":[]},"139":{"Name":"NWN2 Damage Output Calculator","Author":"Loki_999","Submitted":20071009,"Updated":20071015,"Category":"Utility","Forum Thread":"Link","Format":"Excel","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"What this nifty little utility does is enables you to choose your classes and weapons and it will calculate your average damage output over a range of ACs.\n\nIts an excel sheet and there is some code in it therefore you will need to ensure your security settings in excel allow you to run macros.\n\nIf you have a bit of excel knowledge and you want to take a look under the hood feel free.

I've played the game off and on since release, and every time I fire it up I'm immediately frustrated by the lack of customization allowed. Shortly after the game came out, Bluechipps (from the NWN2 forums) made a short AHK script that switched the mouse controls around in an attempt to make things more \"WoW-like\". Even using his program, coupled with making custom changes in my mouse's software, I've always felt that more could be done.\n\nThis program started off as a simple pet-project for myself and friends, but eventually added so much functionality that I decided it was probably worth sharing. I have deliberately not assigned any features to the mouse thumb button(s), because not everyone has a 4+ button mouse. You can, however, still use those extra buttons with the game's built-in keymap.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n========================================\nNOTICE:\n========================================\n\n*THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT MODIFY NOR ALTER THE NWN2 GAME FILES IN ANY WAY*\n\nThis application uses an upper-level keyboard hook to simulate keystrokes/mouseclicks assigned to different hotkey combinations. It would have been much simpler to design this application to read the game's .ini files and make the appropriate key-changes automatically, but I have gone out of my way to avoid doing so for various (including legal) reasons.\n\nAs a result, you must pay close attention to the instructions below to ensure that any custom keybinds you may have changed/added in the game do not create conflicts.\n\n\n========================================\nInstallation:\n========================================\n\nNone. Simply run the application and follow the on-screen directions. Pay close attention to the mandatory key-bindings. If you have customized your hotkeys with the in-game Keybinding section, some features will not work (or work undesirably) as noted in the 'Features' list below.\n\nAt the very least, the movement keys *MUST* be rebound in-game as shown in the diagram when you start this program. Failure to do so will cause all sorts of navigational problems :)\n\nTo uninstall Kornstalx's HotKeys, simply delete the file.\n\n=============================\nFeatures Added for 1.05a:\n=============================\n\n- Added an autorun feature. Double-tapping W key will now put your character in auto-run. To stop, press and release W, or simply press S.\n\n- At the request of a few people on the Bioware forums I've added \"Toggle Walk\" functionality. Understand, though, that I do not officially support this feature as it was quite a head-ache to implement without creating issues. By default, holding down shift makes your character walk. This 1.05a addendum will allow you to use the CapsLock key to force shift to remain held down, by toggling it on and off. However this method created many issues within the game, such as:\n\n 1) Clicking on an object or character to interact with it would automatically exit walk mode\n 2) Clicking on a party member's portrait would do nothing in character cam mode, and performed a shift+click in strategy mode (group add)\n 3) Clicking on a target (Middle Mouse) instantly popped the dropdown menu\n 4) Scrolling the mouse wheel while walking would not zoom (cycles hotbars instead)\n 5) While chatting shift key would still be held down (YOU WOULD TALK LIKE THIS) :)\n\n All of the above issues cannot be resolved by me until Obsidian changes the 'walk' key. Why they chose \"Shift\" for walking (when it's already used by so many other game functions) is beyond my control. As a result, I added code that will automatically drop you *OUT* of walk mode when performing the following actions:\n\n 4) Scrolling the mouse wheel\n 5) Pressing Enter to chat (or pressing Escape to cancel chat)\n\n Understand, however, that the other issues listed above still persist. I highly recommend using the game's 'Detect' or 'Tracking' modes to emulate walking instead when you can, to avoid those problems.\n\n\n========================================\nFeatures:\n========================================\n\n- When in Character Camera mode and holding down the left mouse button to \"drive\" your character, the turn/strafe movement keys will automatically switch (ie, the a key no longer turns left, it will become q and strafe left instead), until you release \"drive\" mode. This allows you to go from \"WoW-style\" movement to NWN1 style movement without having to change out of the Character Camera mode.\n\n- Right Mouse and Middle Mouse have been switched. Right mouse is now \"Free Look\", and Middle mouse now targets/untargets. Holding down Middle Mouse will also popup the game's dropdown menu, according to the delay you set in the game's settings. Note that you can also instantly bring up the dropdown menu by pressing Shift + Middle Mouse.\n\n- Holding down Tab now performs the \"default action\" on your current target. This allows you to press tab to cycle through available targets (assuming you haven't rebound your targetting keys), then press and HOLD tab briefly to automatically perform the default action on that target. This greatly helps prevent misclicks when in close combat. Note that for this to work, you *MUST* bind NumPad Enter to \"Perform Default Action on Target\" in the NWN2 in-game key settings.\n\n- Left Alt now toggles \"Inspection\" on and off. This allows you to keep all objects highlighted without having to hold down the awkward z key. For this to work, you *MUST* keep the default \"Inspection\" key in the NWN2 in-game key settings (default z). Note this feature does not interfere with in game-chatting in any way.\n\n- Pressing Left Ctrl by itself will now change Camera Modes. For this to work, you *MUST* keep the default \"Toggle Play Mode\" key in the in-game key settings (default is the * key).\n\n- Left Windows Key has been disabled. No more accidental Alt-Tabs :)\n\n- ScrollLock manually enables/disables the hotkeys. You will hear an audible beep, and the ScrollLock keyboard light will reflect the program's current state (off == disabled). Note that the hotkeys are automatically paused when not in-game, however you may still manually disable them if so desired (through ScrollLock, or double-click the tray icon).\n\n- Exiting NWN2 will automatically close Kornstalx's HotKeys, as well.\n\n\n========================================\nKnown Issues/Workarounds:\n========================================\n\n- While walking around everywhere with the \"Inspection\" key permanently toggled on sounds like a great idea, understand that the NWN2 Engine does not always highlight creatures/objects that suddenly come into existence (by trigger/random encounter, for example). After the creature or object spawns, however, \"Inspection\" will always highlight it (if your character can see it). This has nothing to do with Kornstalx's Hotkeys, and is true even if you simply held the z key down indefinitely.\n\n- There is random bug in the NWN2 Engine that crops up when you mix rapid \"Click-to-Move\" orders with manual WASD movement. I cannot seem to isolate the direct cause, but sometimes when you give click-move orders, immediately followed by keypress movement, the keyboard will stop responding. Switching camera modes rapidly seems to make it appear more often. If this ever happens, press and hold Middle Mouse (so that the drop-down menu pops up) and it will fix the issue. Alt-tabbing also seems to correct the problem.\n\n- This application been tested to work in conjunction with Logitech Setpoint v4.4 ONLY. If you encounter weird issues with keys not working or perhaps sticking, try exiting your 3rd-party mouse software and see if that remedies the problem before sending a bug report.\n\n- This application has only briefly been tested on Windows Vista. I encountered no issues, but have not delved into debugging it thoroughly (yet, anyway).\n\n\nPlease email any Questions/Comments/Bugs to kornstalx@comcast.net\n\n","Rating":10,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"180":{"Name":"SpellMetaData.2da","Author":"Pain","Submitted":20080513,"Updated":20080513,"Category":"2DA Files","Forum Thread":"Link","Format":"2da","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"This is a 2da file designed to add additional information which is not available from the in game 2da's for use for those writing scripts.\n\nThis 2da file that matches up row for row with spells.2da so you can use the Constant for the spell or the current spell id to access information from this table.\n\nColumns have information about the school, sub-school, domains, descriptors, elements, level in a variety of classes, and Boolean values to describe the spell in more detail, whether it is arcane, divine, profane, AOE, Direct Target, Melee Touch, Ranged Touch.

If you have the feat you can apply its effects to the Glaive.\n- Added Weapon Finesse to Eldritch Glaive. If you have it the melee touch uses dexterity instead of strength.\n- Corrected all the bugs of Eldritch Glaive's attacks of opportunity, namely no more AoO if the caster is stunned, paralyzed, knockdown etc.\n- Finely tuned Attacks of Opportunity routine of Eldritch Glaive to work better.\n- Corrected bug with Eldritch Blast not having impact visual appears for some blasts.\n\n\nVersion 1.26a\n--------------\n\n- Corrected touch attacks: they no more take into account equipped weapons enhancements to calculate the roll. This was a bug of NWN2; if you had a +5 weapon equipped and you had a BAB of 10 the base touch attack roll (assuming 10 dex on a ranged touch) was 15 instead of 10. Now it is corrected. All spells requiring a touch attack will not take in consideration the enhancement bonus of the equipped weapon.\n\n\nVersion 1.26\n--------------\n\n- Added Eldritch Glaive blast shape as per DnD:\n\nYour eldritch blast takes on physical substance, appearing similar to a glaive. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee touch attack as if wielding a reach weapon. If you hit, your target is affected as if struck by your eldritch blast (including any eldritch essence applied to the blast). Unlike Hideous Blow, you cannot combine your Eldritch Glaive with damage from a held weapon. \n\nFurthermore, until the start of your next turn, you also threaten nearby squares as if wielding a reach weapon, and you can make attacks of opportunity with your Eldritch Glaive. These are melee touch attacks. \nIf your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you can (as part of the full-round action) make as many attacks with your Eldritch Glaive as your base attack bonus allows. For example, a 12th-level warlock could attack twice, once with a base attack bonus of +6, and again with a base attack bonus of +1. \n\n(NOTE: I cannot hook the new metamagic to appear on the metamagics list and make the users be able to select essences inside the Eldritch Glaive as you can do for other shapes because it's a thing that must be done internally; the engine doesn't recognize the new metamagic feat and the GUI (quickspell.xml) doesn't add it.\nNo problems at all, however. Just use the essences instead. For example, select \"sickening blast\" and you will find the icon \"Eldritch Glaive\" inside it to use. If you instead want to use the Eldritch Glaive without essences there's no problem, it's under the spells, as usual.)\n\n\n- Adjourned Elritch Sculptor to work with the new shape. If you have Eldritch Sculptor you add an extra 1d6 damage for every two blast levels.\n- Removed Eldritch Master. Sorry, but Eldritch Sculptor and Eldritch Master are too overpowered togheter, also because Eldritch Master is the Obsidian Eldritch Sculptor. I think my version is better. If you prefer Eldritch Master no problem, simply go inside feat.2da and remove the \"1\" on the last column of the 1958 feat. Do the same with Eldritch Sculptor (putting it to 1 this time, feat #3000).\n- Reworked a bit Flee the Scene to work better. Now you can query actions while you teleport; for example you can teleport and query an attack to a creature that will be executed after the teleport.\n- Corrected bug on Flee the Scene that made the spell not work if one moved while teleporting.\n- Better implementation of Repelling Blast.\n- Small changes to shapes and essences to make them work better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODIFICATIONS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nGeneral\n--------\n\n- Modified Saving Throws to work as DnD, with racial restrictions (for example Constructs are immune to all effects having a fortitude saving)\n- Corrected touch attacks:(NEW) they no more take into account equipped weapons enhancements to calculate the roll. This was a bug of NWN2; if you had a +5 weapon equipped and you had a BAB of 10 the base touch attack roll (assuming 10 dex on a ranged touch) was 15 instead of 10. Now it is corrected.\n- Implemented the possibility to change racial type for the player.\n- Implemented the possibility to modify caster level on the fly (see for example Death Knell in the spell changes for an example)\n- Added sudden metamagic feats (sudden extend, sudden empower, sudden maximize, sudden still and sudden quicken)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nClasses\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWarlock\n----------\n\n- Added all Warlock Epic Feats and Invocations. To know more read the feats section.\n- Fixed Warlock to have the right save DC on eldritch blasts (10 + half-level, shape level or essence level whatever is higher + Charisma modifier)\n- Fixed all Invocations with the right save DC and right caster level (including Practiced Spellcaster that I added)\n- Implemented Eldritch Glaive as per DnD:(NEW) Your eldritch blast takes on physical substance, appearing similar to a glaive. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee touch attack as if wielding a reach weapon. If you hit, your target is affected as if struck by your eldritch blast (including any eldritch essence applied to the blast).

Their adherence to the code of bushido is intimidating to their foes, and the fixed stare of a samurai can unnerve most opponents.\n\nAbilities: Daisho proficency, Two Swords as One, Kiai Smite, Improved Initiative, Staredown, Mobility, Improved Two Swords as One, Improved Staredown, Greater Two Swords as One, Frigthful Presence, Perfect Two Swords as One, Greater Staredown\n\n\n\nNew Prestige Classes\n--------------------\n\n- Abjurant Champion:\n----------------------\nWhile the Eldritch Knight strives to balance her mystical and martial prowess, the Abjurant Champion focuses her spells to enhance her defensive ability and hinder enemy spellcasters. Perfectly suited for martial stalwarts who dabble in magic, this class offers the ability to improve their combat skills in ways neither pure soldiers nor spellcasters can.\n\nClass Levels: 5\nBAB: High\nSavings: Fort and Will\nAbilities: Arcane Spellcasting Progression (full), Abjurant Armor, Luminous Armor, Greater Luminous Armor\n\n\n- Bladesinger:\n--------------\nBladesingers are elves who have blended art, swordplay, and arcane magic into a harmonious whole. In battle, a bladesinger's lithe movements and subtle tactics are beautiful, belying their deadly martial efficiency.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: High\nSavings: Fort and Will\nAbilities: Arcane Spellcasting Progression (half), Bladesong Style, Spellsong, Song of Celerity, Song of Fury\n\n\n- Blood Magus:\n--------------------\nDeath is the ultimate risk that warlocks, like all adventurers, must contend with. Some are cut down before they have a chance at true glory; others find true peace only in the afterlife; and others are brought back from death by companions with the powerful magical resources to perform such a miracle. For a rare few such individuals, this trip to the great beyond and back brings a new enlightenment� a comprehension of the body and its individual parts that transcends the understanding of those who have not experienced death and returned to tell the tale.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Medium\nSavings: Will\nAbilities: Invocations progression (full but level 5 and 10), Improved Caster Level (eldritch blast and caster level progression, full), Blood Component, Stanch, Death Knell, Bloodseeking Blast, Thicker Than Water, Awaken Blood, Infusion, Bloodwalk\n\n\n- Fochlucan Lyrist:\n-------------------\nWarrior, thief, spy, poet, woodland champion -- the Fochlucan lyrist is a legendary figure who serves as the herald and teacher to great kings, the champion of the common folk, and the keeper of lore long forgotten elsewhere. Only the best and brightest are invited to become Fochlucan lyrists, and those who eventually win the approval of the Fochlucan College's masters are remarkable individuals indeed, skilled in swordplay, magic, and diplomacy.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Medium\nSaving: Ref and Will\nAbilities: Divine and Arcane Spellcasting Progression (full), Bardic Music, No XP penalty for multiclassing\n\n\n- Enlightened Spirit:\n---------------------------\nAlthough the fiendish origins of the warlock's power can't be denied, he need not fully embrace the darkness. Some warlocks start down the fiendish path, then repent and turn towards the light. Such rare individuals are called enlightened spirits.\nOnly good-aligned warlocks can take this prestige class. Enlightened spirits lose the flexibility of knowing all invocations but instead gain specific, powerful invocations abilities to use in the fight against evil.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Medium\nHigh Saves: Will\n\nAbilities: Invocations progression (half), Eldritch Blast progression (+1d6 every even-numbered level), Aura of Courage, Aura of Menace, Spirit Blast, Spirit Armor, Celestial Speed, Diplomatic, Energy Resistance, Holy Blast, Transform Magic, Death Ward\n\n\n\n- Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil:\n---------------------------------\nA master of defensive magic, the Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil works with the innate power of colors. Their properties can be brought forth by the skilled mage, culminating in the perfection of the prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil approaches the prismatic barrier by mastering one by one its constituent veils or layers. Her skillful wardings can deflect many of the most perilous attacks enemy spellcasters or monsters can muster, shielding herself and her companions against harm. Her keen insight into the ultimate secrets of abjuration also allows her to easily unbind the defenses of others, and in time she learns the most dreadful of magical attacks: the spectacular and lethal kaleidoscopic doom.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Low\nSaving: Will\nAbilities: Arcane Spellcasting Progression (full), Warding (personal, area, sight), Veils (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), Double Warding, Kaleidoscopic Doom\n\n\n\n- Recaster:\n-----------\nAdept at casting spells swiftly, with more power and to their maximum potency, most recasters are self-taught scholars and experimenters. While the techniques of the class grow from a philosophical perspective shared by many who study arcane magic, that perspective isn't necessarily taught in specific schools or widely promulgated through other means. In many ways, the Recaster is simply an outgrowth of a very natural caster question: \"Can I change my spells without altering the way they are casted?\" Magicians who manage to discover the affirmative answer to that question become recasters. \n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Low\nSavings: Will\nAbilities: Arcane Spellcasting Progression (full), Metamorphic Spell (Strength: sudden empower, Time: sudden quicken, Destruction: sudden maximize)\n\n\n- Spellsword:\n-------------\nSpellswords are spellcasters who have managed to blend the art of wearing armour and hitting foes over the head with big swords as well as wielding magic. They forgo some spellcasting powers in return for great proficiency with weapons and the ability to use those weapons as a conduit for their magic. There are no organisations of spellswords and each one is unique. They may not even use swords, prefering other weapons such as staffs, spears or whips.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: High\nSavings: Fort and Will\nAbilities: Arcane Spellcasting Progression (half), Ignore Spell Failure Light Armor, Ignore Spell Failure Medium Armor, Ignore Spell Failure Shields, Ignore Spell Failure Heavy Armor, Ignore Spell Failure Tower Shields\n\n\n\n- Wild Mage:\n------------\nThe wild mage aspires to cast spells without structure. By taking the risk of substituting an element of randomness, she gives up the safe predictability of other arcane spellcasters. This risk allows for the potential of power greater than other casters can hope for. Of course, she also risks the potential for less power, but what is magic if not risky? Chaos is strong, and her magic often carries her to heights of power that other casters cannot reach.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Low\nSavings: Will\nAbilities: Warlock/Arcane Spellcasting Progression (full), Wild Magic, Spells Absorber, Chaotic Mind, Improved Wild Magic, Wildstrike\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECENT CHANGES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVersion 1.25\n--------------\n\n- Removed a bug that caused epic warlock feats to not be selectable if taking many levels in prestige classes. \n- Added new Grapple routine.\n- Reworked all spells that require a grapple to better conform with DnD.\n- Reworked Creeping Doom and Tenacious plague: they no more stack with themselves, do more damage and are more closer to DnD now.\n- Added all Warlock's epic feats and invocations.\n\nVersion 1.24:\n-------------\n\n- Totally reworked the Palemaster.\n- Removed little bug with icon effects not appearing also if the effects where applied\n\nVersion 1.23\n-------------\n\n- Implemented new saving throw system, taking in account racial immunities as per DnD (for example Constructs are immune to fortitude saving throws)\n- Implemented new racial type routine for changing the racial type of player (used for custom classes)\n- Added New Prestige Class:\n\n\"Enlightened Spirit (invocation class)\n\nAlthough the fiendish origins of the warlock's power can't be denied, he need not fully embrace the darkness.

Some are cut down before they have a chance at true glory; others find true peace only in the afterlife; and others are brought back from death by companions with the powerful magical resources to perform such a miracle. For a rare few such individuals, this trip to the great beyond and back brings a new enlightenment� a comprehension of the body and its individual parts that transcends the understanding of those who have not experienced death and returned to tell the tale.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Medium\nSavings: Will\nAbilities: Invocations progression (full but level 5 and 10), Improved Caster Level (eldritch blast and caster level progression, full), Blood Component, Stanch, Death Knell, Bloodseeking Blast, Thicker Than Water, Awaken Blood, Infusion, Bloodwalk\n\nThe class perk is the possibility to increase caster level and eldritch blast damage on the fly, teleportation with damage and a blood damage melee touch attack. For more informations read the class description inside the pack.\n\n- Added Practiced Spellcaster for the Warlock.\n\n- Changed the Death Knell spell to work more similarly to DnD:\nIf target is near death and fails a will save the caster gets temporary hit points, 2 more strenght and 1+ caster level.\n\n- Corrected bug with certain abilities that didn't remove effects correctly due to a missed loop close.\n\n- Corrected eldritch blast save DC bug; now it correctly stops at level 9 the max level of spells, but can still be raised by caster level mods as blood component\n\nVersion 1.21d\n--------------\n- Reworked Repelling Blast to finally work as DnD:\n\"This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a repelling blast. Any medium or smaller creature struck by a repelling blast must make a Reflex save or be hurled 1d6x5 feet directly away from you and knocked prone by the energy of the attack.\"\n- Polished all the invocations to have better feedback\n- Resolved some little bugs with the new feats\n\n\nVersion 1.21b:\n--------------\n- Draining Blast changed to Sickening Blast (-2 to skills, savings, abilities, BAB and damage rolls) on a failed fort save, as per DnD\n- Noxious Blast modified to have a nauseated effect (similar to daze), as per DnD\n- Frightful Blast changed to a shaken effect (-2 to skills, savings, abilities, BAB and damage rolls + frightened) on a failed will save, as per DnD\n- Hellrime Blast -4 to dexterity duration is now correctly 10 minutes\n- Doom Shape changed to affect only enemies 20 feet around the caster as per DnD.\n- Changed Repelling Blast (was hindering blast): any Large or smaller creature struck by a repelling blast must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone by the energy of the attack. (I had to remove the hurl effect, now it does only knockdown, but modded the creatures affected by large or inferior). \n- Better implementation of Voracious Dispelling\n- Better implementation of Devour Magic, now it gives temporary hit point to ANY spell removed as per description and DnD.\n- Corrected bug stacking of effects with multiple rays with differents shapes/essences\n\n\nVersion 1.21a:\n---------------\nModified The Dead Walk and Animate Dead spells to work as per Dnd - this is the description:\n\n\"This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow your spoken commands.\n\nThe undead will follow you and attack any creature hostile. They remain animated until they are destroyed or turn into dust after 1 minute.\n\nRegardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can�t create more HD of undead than your caster level (max 20) with a single casting of animate dead.\n\nThe undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 2 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.\"\n\nI changed the amount of HD per single cast to the caster level and the max to 2x or it was too much of a mess. I also changed the fact that the total is for a party, not for the single. Believe me, if you will have a screen full of undead you will get why I did it.\n\n\nVersion 1.21:\n-------------\nAdded the Wild Mage Prestige class (a caster adept at randomizing effects of spells and defend against them).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nINSTALL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe installation is simple. You will only have to put all the content of the pack inside your Override folder (foundable in \"My Documents/Neverwinter Nights 2\" folder), and then add the dialog.tlk inside the folder where you installed NWN2 (usually \"Program Files/Atari/Neverwinter Nights 2\"). Before doing it however first make a backup of the previous dialog.tlk in case you want to remove the pack.\n\nTo disinstall just remove the directory inside the override folder and replace the old dialog.tlk.\n\nI suggest you to create different folders for all the packs you have inside the override. NWN2 take the LAST version of a file it found inside the override. This means that you can have multiple same files in separate folders. I will make an example. Suppose you have two folders with two packs, one called \"My_pack\" and this one called \"Prestige_classes\" inside your override. Both have classes.2da inside. Since alphabetically P comes after M the classes.2da of the folder \"Prestige_classes\" will be the one used by the engine. So remember to put the file you want NWN2 to use in a folder that comes alphabetically after all the others. Use numbers for example, as I do.\n\nNOTE: This pack requires Storm of Zehir. Sorry, but I didn't do a version for MoTB. If you REALLY want, I will do a version for it, it's not difficult, it's only time consuming.","Rating":9.73,"Votes":16,"Awards":[]},"196":{"Name":"SoZ: Accusation in Nimbre and the Inquisitive Pig","Author":"HS_Tri","Submitted":20081201,"Updated":20111201,"Category":"Other","Forum Thread":"Link","Format":"Other","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"I made an attempt at restoring the Nimbre situation in Obsidian's expansion Storm of Zehir.\n\nNow you can convince the captain to let the villagers go if you find evidence that there is a traitor living in their village.\n\nAdditionally this restores the Inquisitive Pig.\n\nInstallation: Extract the folder \"nimbre\" into your override folder.

So it cannot be changed by Power attack and weapon feats. Cleave works with it however, and so does AoO.\nHaving discovered this, Glaive is finished. I will now start working on the missing Invocations and adding sneak attack damage to all blasts. \n\n\nVersion 1.02f\n--------------\n\n- Added Cleave to Eldritch Glaive. If you have the feat you can apply its effects to the Glaive.\n- Added Weapon Finesse to Eldritch Glaive. If you have it the melee touch uses dexterity instead of strength.\n- Changed Eldritch Glaive to work as before, only one hit. It is more immediate and it cause less trouble. Maybe visually it was interesting but it works much better the way it is now.\n\n\nVersion 1.02e\n--------------\n\n- Implemented a better version of Eldritch Glaive: now it works more as an effective attack instead of giving instantly as many hits as the BAB gives.\n- Corrected all the bugs of Eldritch Glaive's attacks of opportunity, namely no more AoO if the caster is stunned, paralyzed, knockdown etc.\n- Finely tuned Attacks of Opportunity routine of Eldritch Glaive to work better.\n- Corrected bug with Eldritch Blast not having impact visual appears for some blasts.\n- Corrected bug with Enlightened Spirits not having Death Ward and Diplomatic feats working.\n\n\nVersion 1.02c\n--------------\n\n- Corrected all touch attacks: they no more take into account equipped weapons enhancements to calculate the roll. This was a bug of NWN2; if you had a +5 weapon equipped and you had a BAB of 10 the base touch attack roll (assuming 10 dex on a ranged touch) was 15 instead of 10. Now it is corrected.\n\n\nVersion 1.02b\n--------------\n\n- Reworked a bit Flee the Scene to work better. Now you can query actions while you teleport; for example you can teleport and query an attack to a creature that will be executed after the teleport.\n- Corrected bug on Flee the Scene that made the spell not work if one moved while teleporting.\n- Better implementation of Repelling Blast.\n- Small changes to shapes and essences to make them work better.\n\n\nVersion 1.02a\n-------------\n\n- Corrected a bug with Eldritch Glaive and attacks of opportunity. I was a little tired yesterday and didn't notice an obvious thing. Sorry.\n- Removed Eldritch Master. Sorry, but Eldritch Sculptor and Eldritch Master are too overpowered togheter, also because Eldritch Master is the Obsidian Eldritch Sculptor. I think my version is better. If you prefer Eldritch Master no problem, simply go inside feat.2da and remove the \"1\" on the last column of the 1958 feat. Do the same with Eldritch Sculptor (putting it to 1 this time, feat #3000).\n\n\nVersion 1.02\n-------------\n\n- Added Eldritch Glaive blast shape as per DnD:\n\nYour eldritch blast takes on physical substance, appearing similar to a glaive. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee touch attack as if wielding a reach weapon. If you hit, your target is affected as if struck by your eldritch blast (including any eldritch essence applied to the blast). Unlike Hideous Blow, you cannot combine your Eldritch Glaive with damage from a held weapon. \n\nFurthermore, until the start of your next turn, you also threaten nearby squares as if wielding a reach weapon, and you can make attacks of opportunity with your Eldritch Glaive. These are melee touch attacks. \nIf your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you can (as part of the full-round action) make as many attacks with your Eldritch Glaive as your base attack bonus allows. For example, a 12th-level warlock could attack twice, once with a base attack bonus of +6, and again with a base attack bonus of +1. \n\n(NOTE: I cannot hook the new metamagic to appear on the metamagics list and make the users be able to select essences inside the Eldritch Glaive as you can do for other shapes because it's a thing that must be done internally; the engine doesn't recognize the new metamagic feat and the GUI (quickspell.xml) doesn't add it.\nNo problems at all, however. Just use the essences instead. For example, select \"sickening blast\" and you will find the icon \"Eldritch Glaive\" inside it to use. If you instead want to use the Eldritch Glaive without essences there's no problem, it's under the spells, as usual.)\n\n\n- Adjourned Elritch Sculptor to work with the new shape. If you have Eldritch Sculptor you add an extra 1d6 damage for every two blast levels.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nThis pack is an extract of the full \"Base & Prestige Classes Pack\" of the same author. If you are interested in other classes reworks, other new prestige classes and the full list of changes please refer to that pack here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nGENERAL MODIFICATIONS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n- Added all Warlock Epic Feats and Invocations. To know more read the feats section.\n- Fixed Warlock to have the right save DC on eldritch blasts (10 + half-level, shape level or essence level whatever is higher + Charisma modifier)\n- Fixed all Invocations with the right save DC and right caster level (including Practiced Spellcaster that I added)\n- Implemented point blank shot to work as DnD on eldritch blasts (giving +1 to damage if below 30 feet)\n- Implemented Eldritch Glaive as per DnD:(NEW) Your eldritch blast takes on physical substance, appearing similar to a glaive. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee touch attack as if wielding a reach weapon. If you hit, your target is affected as if struck by your eldritch blast (including any eldritch essence applied to the blast).

Activating this ability is part of the action to use an eldritch blast. If you use an eldritch blast or imbue it with the eldritch spear blast shape, you apply the damage of two blasts in one, at the same target. If you imbue your eldritch blast with the hideous blow shape, the damage will be increased by 1d6 for every two eldritch blast levels. If you imbue your eldritch blast with the eldritch glaive shape, the damage will be increased by 1d6 for every two eldritch blast levels. If you imbue your eldritch blast with the eldritch chain blast shape, the maximum distance between each target increases to 60 feet, the maximum number of targets you can affect double, the damage of succesive targets is not halved, and the damage is increased by 1d6 for every four eldritch blast levels. If you use an eldritch cone shape the range increase to 120 feet and the damage is increased by 1d6 for every three eldritch blast levels. If you use the eldritch doom blast shape the area of effect increases to 40 feet from you and the damage is increased by 1d6 for every three eldritch blast levels.\nFurthermore you gain +2 bonus on attack rolls to hit an opponent with your eldritch blast. This is an extraordinary ability.\n\n\nLord of all Essences\nYou have mastered the art of enhancing your eldritch essences.\nPrerequisites: Spellcraft 24 ranks, Eldritch Blast\nBenefit: When you use an essence with an eldritch blast the power of the essence is increased, and the type of increase depends on the effect of the essence. If you use an essence that have a sicken effect, the effect increase in power and become a shaken effect. If you use an essence that drain levels, the level drain is doubled. If you use an essence that does damage over time, the damage is doubled, and so on. Activating this ability is part of the action to use an eldritch blast. \nIn addition, the DC of all eldritch essence invocations you use increases by 2. This is an extraordinary ability.\n\n\nMaster of Elements\nYou have achieved mastery of the four elements -- air, earth, fire, and water.\nPrerequisites: Spellcraft 24 ranks, Concentration 12 ranks. Warlock\nBenefit: As a full-round action, you can summon a swarm of elder elementals of the air, earth, fire, and water subtype. The monsters serves you for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. Activating this ability requires a standard action. You can use dominate monster on elementals. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to your caster level. Activating this ability requires a standard action.\nYou gain energy resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. If you have energy resistance from the warlock class, your resistance to those two elements increases by 10. This is an extraordinary ability. \n\n\nMorpheme Savant\nYour words are charged with supernatural power.\nPrerequisites: Spellcraft 24 ranks, Bluff 12 ranks. Warlock\nBenefit: You can use power word blind, power word kill, or power word stun. Activating this ability requires a standard action.\nWhen you use your beguiling influence invocation, the bonus granted on your Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks is equal to double your Charisma bonus or +6, whichever is greater. Using this ability is part of the casting of the beguiling influence invocation. It is an extraordinary ability. \n\n\nParagon Visionary\nYour powers of perception are beyond mortal ken.\nPrerequisites: Spellcraft 24 ranks, Craft Alchemy 12 ranks. Warlock\nBenefit: You can see through illusions, magical darkness, shapechangers, and other effects (as true seeing) and you receive concealment. Furthermore every creature targeted by your eldritch blast lose any form of concealment, if he has any. This is a supernatural ability. \nYou receive a bonus on Listen and Spot checks equal to double your Wisdom modifier or +6, whichever is greater. This is a supernatural ability. \n\n\nShadow Master\nYou have walked the path of shadows, and now you have mastered its secrets.\nPrerequisites: Spellcraft 24 ranks, Lore 12 ranks. Warlock\nBenefit: You can create streaking masses of shadow around your form, providing you with a 50% miss chance against all attacks. Activating this ability requires a standard action and last 1 minute/caster level.\nFor every minute you pass in this shadow-form you are fully healed and all not extraordinary or supernatural hill effects are removed as if you had fully rested. This is an extraordinary ability. \n\n\nSouleater Incarnate\nYou have mastered the fusion of invocation and incarnum.\nPrerequisites: Spellcraft 24 ranks, Intimidate 12 ranks. Warlock\nBenefit: By studying the unique qualities of the mysterious souleater, you have learned a variety of secret powers. When using this feat, you consume the soul of any living hostile creature that is near death within 60 feet of you. For 10 minutes following the death, you gain +10 temporary hit points, +1 bonus on attack rolls and saving throws and +1 caster level from any creature that had her soul consumed. \nFurthermore for 1 minute you radiate an aura that makes it difficult for enemies within 30 feet to cast spells. Any hostile creature within 30 feet must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + half your caster level + your Charisma bonus) or be unable to cast any spell. This is an extraordinary ability.\n\n\nVerminlord\nYou have unparalleled insight into the ways of vermin.\nPrerequisites: Spellcraft 24 ranks, Warlock.\nBenefit: You can summon ten swarms of Gargantuan centipedes. The centipedes do 2d6 + 4 damage, have a BAB of +6 plus double your Charisma modifier and inflict poison. The attacks of any centipede swarms summoned are threated as +5 weapons to overcome damage reduction. Activating this ability requires a standard action and it last for 1 round/caster level.\nWhen you use the tenacious plague invocation, the summoned creatures bypass damage reduction in the way listed above and the two swarms can be used one above the other. Using this ability is part of the casting of Tenacious Plage. This is an extraordinary ability. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nPRESTIGE CLASSES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Blood Magus:\n--------------------\nDeath is the ultimate risk that warlocks, like all adventurers, must contend with. Some are cut down before they have a chance at true glory; others find true peace only in the afterlife; and others are brought back from death by companions with the powerful magical resources to perform such a miracle. For a rare few such individuals, this trip to the great beyond and back brings a new enlightenment� a comprehension of the body and its individual parts that transcends the understanding of those who have not experienced death and returned to tell the tale.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Medium\nSavings: Will\n- Invocations per Day: At each level except 5th and 10th, a blood magus gains new invocations per day as if he had also gained a warlock level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a warlock would have gained (such as improved energy resistance).\n- Improved Caster Level: A Blood Magus adds his class level to his warlock level to determine his effective caster level (including eldritch blast level). For example, a 10th level warlock/6th-level blood magus's caster level would be effectively 16th, due to this ability, but he would not have access to dark invocations as a 16th level warlock (10th level warlock plus five invocations levels due to being a 6th level blood magus)\n- Blood Component: A blood magus can add a drop of his own blood to increase his warlock caster level. Using this ability deals 1 point of blood damage to the magus every time an invocation or eldritch blast is used, but it raises the caster level or the level of shape and/or essence by 1 (so that for example a lesser shape becomes a least shape), whatever is used. Using this ability (or stop using it) is a free action. Caster level affects all level-based variables of invocations and eldritch blasts, including spell penetration checks.\n- Stanch: A blood magus knows how to delay his own death until it's inevitable. Every time a blood magus is near to die, he regenerates 1 hit point per class level every round. \n- Death Knell: At 3rd level and higher, a blood magus has the ability to use death knell as the spell once per day.\n- Bloodseeking Blast: Beginning at 5th level, a blood magus can imbue his eldritch blast with the ability to draw blood from its targets. To use this ability, a blood magus must inflict a wound on himself; this is a free process that deals 3 points of damage to the blood magus and becomes a normal part of using an eldritch blast. A bloodseeking blast deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to each creature hit by an eldritch blast, increasing to 2d6 at level ten. Damage reduction, if the creature has any, doesn't apply to this type of damage. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to the damage.\n- Thicker Than Water: At 7th level and higher, a blood magus's vital fluids are partially under his control. When a blood magus is injured, his blood withdraws from the wound, avoiding some damage that he would otherwise take. This ability gives the blood magus damage reduction 1/bludgeoning.\n- Awaken Blood: At 8th level and higher, a blood magus can bestow momentary consciousness on an opponent's blood. If he hits a foe with a melee touch attack, the opponent's blood tries to get free of its confinement - all at once. The pressure disrupts the victim's tissues, dealing 10d10 points of damage. This ability is usable every minute, and a blood magus can reuse it immediately if his previous attempt failed. The effect is instantaneous. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this effect.\n- Infusion: Upon reaching 9th level, a blood magus prepares a special one-time distillation of his own blood. After partaking of the infusion, he gains total immunity to poisons and diseases.\n- Bloodwalk: At 10th level, a blood magus becomes perfectly attuned to the song of blood. He gains the supernatural ability to transport himself at great distances via the blood of living creatures. Once every two rounds, as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, he can seamlessly enter any living creature (except an elemental, ooze, plant, undead, or other creature without blood or a similar fluid) whose size equals or exceeds his own, regardless of the distance separating the two, and then exit on a close distance. A blood magus must designate a target to enter and exit, as a dimension door. The blood magus must make a successful ranged touch attack to succesfully enter the creature (a missed ranged touch enable the magus to reuse the ability immediately) and, upon exit, the destination creature finds being the endpoint of a magical portal surprising and quite unsettling. If the creature fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blood magus's class level + blood magus's Con modifier) the exiting burst will deal 10d6 damage, while on a succesful save the blood magus will exit the creature without doing any damage. The shock of the expulsion is strong both for the creature and the magus himself. Both must succeed on a Fortitude Save (DC 15) or be stunned for 1 round.\n\n\n- Enlightened Spirit:\n---------------------------\nAlthough the fiendish origins of the warlock's power can't be denied, he need not fully embrace the darkness. Some warlocks start down the fiendish path, then repent and turn towards the light. Such rare individuals are called enlightened spirits.\nOnly good-aligned warlocks can take this prestige class. Enlightened spirits lose the flexibility of knowing all invocations but instead gain specific, powerful invocations abilities to use in the fight against evil.\n\nClass Levels: 10\nBAB: Medium\nHigh Saves: Will\n\n- Invocations: Every even-numbered level, you gain new invocations known and an increase in caster level as if you had also gained levels in an invocation-using class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. If you had more than one invocation-using class before becoming an enlightened spirit, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining caster level and invocations known.\n- Aura of Courage: You are immune to fear, and each ally within 10 feet of you gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.\n- Aura of Menace: A righteous aura surrounds you whenever you fight. Any hostile creature within a 5-foot radius of you takes a -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves. A creature that has resisted the effect can't be affected again by your aura.\n- Spirit Blast: You can change your eldritch blast into a spirit blast. The blast deals an extra 1 point of damage per die to undead. Your spirit blast also affects incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance.\n- Eldritch Blast: At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, the damage of your eldritch blast improves by ld6 points.\n- Spirit Armor: Beginning at 2nd level, you gain a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. The bonus improves to +2 at 6th level and +3 at 10th level.\n- Celestial Speed: At 3rd level, you gain the celestial speed ability invocation. The powers of light bear you aloft as you sprout shimmering spirit wings at your feet, enabling you to move at doubled speed. You can enable and disable this ability as a free action.\n- Diplomatic: Beginning at 4th level, the influence of the light on your life begin to persuade people around you. You gain a bonus to diplomacy equal to your class level.\n- Energy Resistance: At 5th level, you gain resistance 5 to any two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, and fire.\n- Holy Blast: At 7th level, you gain the ability to change your eldritch blast into an holy blast. The blast deals an extra 1 point of damage per die to evil outsiders. The blast also blocks the ability for evil outsiders to use conjuration and illusion spells for 1 minute per class level.\n- Transform Magic: Gained at 9th level, this invocation ability allows you to deliver a targeted greater dispel magic with your touch. You or any ally within 30 feet of you can heal as many hit-points as your class level for any spell or spell-like ability dispelled from the target. You can't transform your own invocations.\n- Death Ward: At 10th level, you become immune to death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and negative energy effects as the death ward spell.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLIST OF CHANGES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVersion 1.01\n-------------\n\n- Removed a bug that caused epic warlock feats to not be selectable if taking many levels in prestige classes. \n- Added new Grapple routine.\n- Reworked Chilling Tentacles to do a real grapple and better conform with DnD.\n- Reworked Tenacious plague: it no more stack with itself, do more damage and is closer to DnD now.\n- Added all Warlock's epic feats and invocations.\n\n\n\n","Rating":9.75,"Votes":15,"Awards":["Best Other Custom Content Nominee 2008"]},"201":{"Name":"Altered SoZ Ranged Weapons","Author":"Jake Zahn","Submitted":20081229,"Updated":20090607,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Originally I thought that most of the magical ranged weapons in SoZ are 'bugged'.

I have only fixed errors where it is obvious what the developers have meant to do, so I have not assumed that the developers meant to allow you to lead the undead army into Port Llast AND keep Septimund, since there is no evidence in the scripting that this was an original plan. Also, while it is feasible that there was supposed to be an option to put Adreum to rest without leading the army or killing him, I found no evidence for it and so did not create it. It also seems reasonable that the developers originally meant Adreum to only show up when Nya mentioned him, but there's also no real evidence in the scripting for that, so I didn't change it. Finally, I didn't bother fixing the sloppy coding that doesn't actually affect gameplay: the music doesn't change back in the graveyard after the undead army leaves, for example. If anyone feels inclinned to changed these things, they are welcome to use the files in my fix as a starting point (you shouldn't need any other files, except that you will have to create scripts and journal entries that don't yet exist). \n\nThis fix is designed using the v1.22 BETA PATCH, so has not been tested with v1.21 (or v1.22, as that has not come out yet). There is no reason I can imagine that it wouldn't work with v1.21, but try it at your own risk. If you do so and find problems, you can let me know and I'll see what I can do. Here are a list of problems fixed:\n\n\n* Nya properly opens her store after the undead army eradicates the Luskans, as long as you've spoken to her and she knows they are gone.\n* If the Luskans are killed in any way (including by the undead army & without Nya's knowledge), you can find Nya in the graveyard and tell her.\n* Nya's faction has been fixed so she doesn't fight the undead army.\n* Nya properly responds to PC (with or without Septimund) after apeaking to her the first time, including when speaking to Lord Adreum first.\n* The undead army leaves when the Luskans are dead (I didn't fix the problems with Adreum sticking around, because the problem is too difficult to fix for something that matters so little).\n* The undead army is gone from Gothaladreum after it leaves it.\n* Adreum cheers on the undead army (like Nya does).\n* Septimund can properly take the Doomguide conversation paths in talking with Lord Adreum, as long as they don't threaten Port Llast (other Doomguides are still welcome to do so, but at the cost of Septimund as a party member)\n* If Nya is convinced to cease summoning undead or killed, Septimund properly talks to the party before leaving the graveyard.\n* Haeromos stops acting as though you have freed him time and time again (before you finish killing the Luskans).\n* Haeromos actually reports that Nya came back as a merchant if the Luskans have left and you convinced her to do so.\n* Haeromos stops giving you the undead quest over and over again if you solved it in certain ways.\n\nAgain, note that these were all simple scripting errors, so I did not change anything that was not the developers' obvious intentions.\n\n\nInstall: Extract the RAR file to your override folder.

They can be played with most community modules and all three official campaigns.\nVersion 3.5 is now available.\nIf you have an older version installed, the 'Version Information.txt' file lists the differences between versions.\n\nWARNING: These classes are NOT standard DnD classes.\n\nThe main purpose of these classes is to support a very popular and interesting type of character build, the self-buffed Arcane or Divine spellcaster, who is transformed, through magic, to a powerful warrior. Each class follows a different approach to achieve this, as it is explained in the following paragraphs:\n\nImportant: Before using these classes, please read the pdf documentation files. They contain vital information!\n\n\nKnight of Mystra\n------------------\nConcept: Remove character development 'side' obstacles that prevent melee spellcasting builds.\n An Eldritch Knight alternative for Arcane casters.\nClass strength: Somewhat stronger than other classes.\nSpellcasting: Full Arcane or Divine spellcasting progression.\n\nIf trying to create a melee Arcane or Divine melee spellcaster character, a number of 'side' obstacles exist in the game (or could be called character development 'holes') just to prevent such a build. Things like low BAB, Arcane Spell Failure and low HD for the Arcane spellcasters, knockdown chains and especially dispel 'bombardment' situations, all these ruin the whole concept of the buffed spellcaster. If spellcasters are to be left to fully deploy their buffing talents, these problems must be 'smoothed' and this is exactly what this class attempts to do.\n\nHoly Guardian\n------------------\nConcept: The ultimate buffer (new buffing spells added).\nClass strength: Notably stronger then other classes\nSpellcasting: Full Divine spellcasting progression.\n\nHoly Guardians are Elite Clerics who have been chosen by their deity to be the watchful protectors of their church. Even though the intense study of the divine has left the Holy Guardians physically weaker than the simple Clerics, their magic is much stronger resulting in a much stronger character. \nThe power of the Holy Guardians comes from their dedicated class spells. These are normal spells (added to the cleric spellbook) but they have restrictions which only allow Holy Guardians of some level to cast them. These spells can be found in two special cleric domains. \n\nHoly Blade\n------------------\nConcept: A Stormlord alternative.\nClass strength: A balanced class, with reasonable powers.\nSpellcasting: Full Divine spellcasting progression.\n\nThe Holy Blade class has many similarities with the Stormlord class and could be considered as an alternative with some improvements (like the odd weapon collection of the Stormlord). Since the Stormlord class was used as a measure for the bonuses granted by the Holy Blade class, I believe that the latter can be safely assumed to be balanced, so it can be used with most modules and campaigns without breaking the game. \n\nArcane Fighter\n------------------\nConcept: Solve key problems for Arcane melee builds.\nClass strength: Can't be said for sure, could be considered somewhat stronger than other classes.\nSpellcasting: Partial Arcane spellcasting progression.\n\nThis class tries to solve three key problems for an Arcane spellcaster melee build: low BAB, low hitpoints and arcane spell failure which prohibits use of heavy armor (and hence an AC loss that must be compensated). The main characteristic of this class is that the fixes for the above problems extend over all character levels (and not only class levels). \n\n\nTo determine the strength of each class, I tried to compare them against these 'prototypes':\nDivine casters: Cleric + Stormlord with Spear & Monkey Grip\nArcane spellcasters: Wizard + Eldritch Knight with Light Armor & Greatsword.\n\nAt the right of this page you can find three quick reference cards which show level progression for the Holy Blade, the Arcane Fighter and the Knight of Mystra classes. \nInstallation or the PrC pack is very simple, just follow the instructions in the txt file found in the zips. \nTwo versions of the pack are provided. One that can be combined with Netriak's buff preservation mod, which is essential to play buffed characters in SoZ, and the normal version for everything else (if you want to play SoZ without Netriak's mod use the normal version). \nFinally, I would like to thank EwaldTheUnimaginative whose great TlkEdit2 utility I used to create the tlk file. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"211":{"Name":"Original NWN 2 campaign level extender","Author":"Colt17","Submitted":20090218,"Updated":20090218,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","NWN2Game":"NWN2:SoZ","Description":"Description:\n\nThis is a small and simple modification which allows you to play original NWN 2 campaign with lvl 1-30 characters(Initially you can play it only with lvl 1-20 characters).\n\nInstallation:\n\n1.

The starting equipment chest will then default to giving a dagger, a club, a light crossbow, 50 bolts, a potion of cure light wounds.\n\nCurrently, there's no support for the Swasbuckler as I do not have Storm of Zehir.

It is extremely far from complete, and only begins to touch upon some possibilities for implementing one.\n\nThe class system explores the idea of generating characters from one of the popular eight towns in Britannia along with one of the eight traditional classes. Only the Bard class has been started and given a package for level 1 abilities.\n\nThe spell system grants a certain number of spells per day depending on class type, with each spell requiring a certain number of reagents to be in the inventory of the caster in order to work. A scripting library is provided that can be used with any spell script to read a 2DA driven list of spells and their associated reagents to determine if the spell can be cast.\n\nI have included a little demo module to see how it works so far in game.\n\nFiles:\n======\nThe BuildersPackage contains separate directories for the 2DA, ERF, TLK, and UI modifications used to create this. I could only get the 2DA files to work from an override directory because I think some of them may not load from a hak. The ERF file contains the scripts for an added UI element and the spell library. The TLK file is the custom one used for class and spell descriptions, etc. The UI directory contains all the XML edits and would probably go in your custom Campaign folder.\n\nThe TestModule package contains an override directory that you will need to play the campaign, a Test Module directory that contains the Campaign folder and the corresponding module to go with it, and a TLK directory with the custom TLK file you need to play it.\n\nI have not spent a lot of time writing detailed documentation or installation instructions because I expect this to be used by just a few parties. If you have any specific questions about implementation, please just send me a message through here or the Bioware forums.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n=============\n1. There are certain places in the character creation process where you cannot go back, but have to use \"Cancel\" and start over. This is because the screen order appears to be hard coded and I skip certain screens so you can't go back. Someone who understands the UI better than I could probably make this better rather easily.\n\n2. If you have any characters in your local vault that were made with this package and you try to play a different module without the override files, your game may crash. I believe this is due to some 2DA entries in the skills area that are probably out of the expected range.\n","Rating":10,"Votes":2,"Awards":[]},"260":{"Name":"Mind Flayer/Illithid/Cthulhu Caves and a Shoggoth","Author":"Chaos Wielder","Submitted":20100427,"Updated":20100427,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before...\n- Edgar Allen Poe\n\n\nThis is a series of visuals I made for the \"Storm of Zehir Holiday Project\"; with them, I could make a proper cavern for curious and forgotten lore.\n\nIncludes:\n\nTileset:\nNew textures for the cave tileset.

Those files control who gains progression if they have a certain feat. Since Favored Soul and Spirit Shaman were NOT in those files (so it was neither a -1 like it should be or **** for no entry) my belief is that the OEI code threw an error or fell through a switch statement to the default case which was full progression. That's why you could get full progression with sorc, fs, and ss all with a single prestige class.\n\nThankfully all of the divine featmaps had to be updated for these two new classes so they had the fixes (except for the hellfire warlock stuff and the doomguide). \n\nLonger story short: the new featmaps I've done include *all* of the progressions for all of the caster base classes. That means no exploit is possible regardless of what prestige class you take. \n\nExisting characters who exploited will suddenly find themselves with the correct number of spells as the engine seems to throw out the invalid ones now that it can correctly calculate how many you should have.

With the possibility of those forums being shut down at any time, it seems as though some people would appreciate this archive.\n\nDownload and decompress the archive to wherever you want it. There will be three directories created -- builds, buildsearch, and images -- and all files will be in one of those directories. (This structure is to allow the files to be easily added to an existing or new website, in addition to being used for personal reference.) If you also grab my archive of the original Epic Character Builders guild, you can decompress both in the same location, and they will share a number of files. For the most part, the shared files are identical in both archives (so it does not matter what you choose when asked if you want to overwrite them while decompressing the second archive), but there is one one file that needs a slight adjustment to handle both archives. For that, decompress the merge file, overwriting the file from the archives.\n\nAfter decompression, where do you start? Well, you need to open certain files in your favorite web browser. To browse the forums, start with:\n\nbuilds/guild2.html\n\nTo search the builds, start with:\n\nbuildsearch/ECB2_search.html\n\nTo view an index of builds by author, you need to choose level 20 or level 30 builds:\n\nbuilds/20index.html\nbuilds/30index.html\n\n\nFor those who are so inclined, the formatting can be adjusted through the .css files. (I went with BioWare's theme as a default.) The layout of the posts of a topic can be adjusted through viewtopic.js (most of those pages are dynamically generated so that they can be easily changed en masse).\n\nLet's see... did I leave anything out? Oh, if there are other guild forums that deserve an archive, I can be convinced to archive them, provided I can read them. I am not inclined to generate search engines for arbitrary guilds, but downloading and processing posts is not a big deal (since I already have it mostly automated).\n\nOh, one other thing -- the original guild archive is hosted on the WoG website, and if you know a little scripting, you may be able to enable links from this archive to that one by uncommenting a portion towards the end of viewtopic.js.

I'm responsible only for the changes, not for the basis. Changes are as follows:\n\nBicFunctions Location & Stability\nMany servers have reported having issues getting XP Character working due to crashes. This is because OEIShared.dll in Kungfoowiz's version is built for a different version than what the plugin has. OEIShared.dll is now linked properly in this version. In addition, the location of BicFunctions.exe can be specified in the xp_character.ini file, to stop confusion.\n\nServervault Location\nTest servers often run into an issue with locations. With different usernames, developers usually have to open their module on their test server, and edit the scripts so that it points to the new, correct path. The path has been moved to the ini file, so that this is no longer required.\n\nFunction: Set Head\nThis function sets the character's head to a certain ID.\n\nFunction: Set Hair\nLike above, only sets the user's hair style. In future versions, this will be useful with my Hair to Helm utility, to allow users to change their hair style and color.\n\nFunction: Retint\nA retint option is now available, to ensure that wing and tail colors automatically match the user's skin tone. By default this is automatically called when SetWing or SetTail is used.\n\nLike it? Vote! Have a suggestion? Comment! Feature requests are highly welcomed. This has been tested on two live servers, though please let me know if I forgot anything in this repackage.\n\n== Change log ==\n2010-10-06: Initial repackage.\n2011-10-09: Updated nwnx_character.nss to reflect the new .ini functionality.

Especially true for those of us on macs who can't look at them in the toolset or use one of the model viewers available here on the Vault.\n\nSo I have begun the task of inventorying the contents, loading the models and their textures into my 3D modeling program and rendering them. Then I'll upload the renders here with labels. I've started with Rapiers, Scimitars and Staffs. Will probably do battle axes and longswords next.\n\nIf anyone wants to help, just pick a grouping like that and send me the image with the model and texture info. I'll upload it here.\n\nBTW, in case anyone doesn't know how to get these into the game, the easiest way is to copy and rename the UTI file for that type of weapon, use GFF Editor (available here: Link to go in and change model part 1 to the number of Cyric's model and the rest to 0 (cyric uses all one part models even for swords). Put the modified UTI into the override folder. Then from in game, open the console, type \"denugmode 1\" then give item [name of UTI file] then \"debugmode 0\" and close the console.\nUpdate: Battle Axes added\nUpdated: Bastard Swords added\nUpdated: Short Swords (part 1) added\n","Rating":10,"Votes":1,"Awards":[]},"293":{"Name":"Dungeon Keeper Voice","Author":"Sayaches","Submitted":20121110,"Updated":20121113,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Use voice from Dungeon Keeper for warlock invocations.\nSimply copy the folder into your my documents/neverwinter nights 2/override folder.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]},"294":{"Name":"Cormick Dialog Fix","Author":"Terridol","Submitted":20121202,"Updated":20121203,"Category":"Other","Format":"Other","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"While playing the game again after several years away. i decided to play a good character, so when I got to Neverwinter I was going to join the watch. But, when I went to do the Hagan quest, the dialog options that kept coming up was if I had talked to Caleb and not Cormick.\n\nAfter investigation I discovered that the conversation with Hagan was looking for a Global Variable that was suppose to be set when I received my Watchman status. This was not so in my case. So I edited the cormick conversation and now is should properly flag you as watch if you join up with them.\n\n-----Installation-------\nJust unpack the Rar and place it in your override folder.

Multiple servers can be selected with ctrl+click and shift+click.\n\nVersion 1.01 -- an issue where multiple instances of opening the server lists would fail to update the server lists is fixed.\nVersion 1.02 -- only requires .NET 2.0, instead of .NET 4.0\nVersion 1.03 -- corrects an issue where exactly 21 players logged on would display the \"no players\" icon.\nVersion 1.04 -- uses a black background with white/red text to indicate whether or not a server requires a password to log in.\nVersion 1.05 -- allows users to double click a server on the list and launch NWN2 via the Client Extension to connect to the selected server (minimum CE version 1.0.0.23).\nVersion 1.06 -- fixes an issue where attempting to open the server lists when they are already open would crash the application. Now, it makes the server lists the foreground window.\nVersion 1.07 -- convenience and formatting fixes. Server lists max height is 600 pixels; default width is wide enough for the vertical scrollbar; default background color matches row background color; keyboard focus defaults to password entry if the server has a password.\nVersion 1.08 -- Server Monitor saves the DM v. player status of the previous connection, and defaults that value in. Also adds a section of the connection window to specify a different home directory (which might have been specified with -home on the CE previously) and remembers previously-used home directory settings, which may be picked from a list later.\nVersion 1.09 -- corrects a crash associated with interrupted connectivity after having already loaded the server lists. The server monitor will remain open, but without information, in such circumstances.","Rating":9.75,"Votes":3,"Awards":[]},"297":{"Name":"Magie infinite e nessuna restrizione (Infinite Spell and no Class restriction","Author":"End_of_dreams","Submitted":20130325,"Updated":20130404,"Category":"2DA Files","Format":"2da","NWN2Game":"All","Description":"Con questo file tutte le classi non avranno nessuna restrizione e in oltre gli incantesimi diventeranno infiniti\n\nWith these file all the class will not have any restriction, and the spells will become unlimited.","Rating":"N/A","Awards":[]}}
